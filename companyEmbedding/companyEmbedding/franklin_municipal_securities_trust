SHAREHOLDER LETTER 

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

We are pleased to bring you Franklin Municipal Securities Trust's annual report 
for the period ended May 31, 2001. The year under review showed clear signs of  
decelerating economic growth. Gross domestic product (GDP), the country's       
broadest gauge of economic vibrancy, fell steadily in the last quarter of 2000  
to a slow, 1.0% annualized pace, then increased to a 1.2% annual rate by the    
first quarter of 2001. Although the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) had taken an
aggressive stance toward mitigating inflationary pressures via interest rate    
hikes in the first half of 2000, it refrained from any such moves during the    
latter half of the year as personal consumption, trade and business expansion   
waned. By January 2001, consumer and business confidence had eroded             
considerably, exacerbated by high energy costs that drained purchasing power and
profit margins. Consequently, slower retail sales and appreciably weaker capital
spending prompted manufacturing cutbacks and subsequent layoffs. The            
unemployment rate, which had hovered near a 30-year low of 3.9% during the      
reporting period, edged up to 4.4% by May 2001.(1) Noting these circumstances,  
in December 2000 the Fed signaled for the first time in two years that          
recession,

"Municipal bond market performance was quite strong during the reporting        
period."                                                                        

rather than inflation, posed the greatest risk to the decade-long economic      
expansion. In an attempt to restore price stability and sustainable economic    
growth, the Fed assumed a new monetary policy stance and on five separate       
occasions cut the federal funds target rate one-half percent, lowering it to    
4.00% by May 31, 2001.                                                          

Municipal bond market performance was quite strong during the reporting period, 
outpacing many other fixed income and equity asset classes. Third quarter 2000  
expectations for further interest rate hikes diminished substantially, creating 
a more favorable bond pricing environment amid falling long-term interest rates.
Bond yields and prices move in an inverse relationship, so that as yields fall, 
prices rise. Overall, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell from 6.01% at 
the beginning of the reporting period, to 5.75% on May 31, 2001, and the 10-year
Treasury note declined from 6.27% to 5.38%. The municipal bond market also saw  
yields decrease, with the Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index (Bond Buyer 40), an   
indicator of municipal bond market performance, dropping from a yield of 6.13%  
to 5.42% for the same period.(2)                                                

Lower supply also favorably impacted municipal bond prices during the reporting 
period. Municipal governments enjoyed one of their wealthiest periods in history
during 2000. As windfall tax revenues and prudent fiscal management led to      
reduced use of municipal debt, the nation's municipal bond supply               

2.   Source: The Bond Buyer, 6/1/01. The unmanaged Bond Buyer Municipal Bond    
    Index is composed of the yield to maturity of 40 bonds. The index attempts
   to track the new-issue market as closely as possible, so it changes bonds
twice a month, adding all new bonds that meet certain requirements and
   deleting an equivalent number according to their secondary market trading
     activity. As a result, the average par call date, average maturity date and
  average coupon rate change over time. The average maturity has generally
been about 29-30 years.                                               

2

declined 12.5% during calendar year 2000 compared to 1999 amid improving credit 
strength.(3) Compounding the drop in new-issue supply was the historical cycle  
of low new issuance during the months of December and January. This confluence  
of heightened investor demand and low supply for municipal debt made municipal  
bonds one of the best-performing asset classes during the year under review.    
However, it is rare for the bond markets to experience such strong price returns
over successive years. Long-term municipal bonds, as measured by the Lehman     
Brothers Municipal Bond Index, have had a 7.7% average annual total return over 
the past 10 years and most of the return is a result of the income contribution,
not price appreciation.(4) Historically, equities have been the strongest       
investments for achieving price appreciation, while bonds provided lower        
volatility, and municipal bonds provided the highest after-tax total return for 
fixed income investors.(5) We do not expect these relationships to change over  
the long term. Although these asset classes may experience periods of extreme   
over- and under-performance, over the long term, each broad investment category 
achieves its primary objectives.                                                

As the nation realized a large federal budget surplus, the U.S. Treasury        
initiated a buyback program for 30-year Treasury bonds, increasing their        
scarcity and price while lowering yields. This meant that, on a relative basis, 
long-term municipal bonds, as measured by the Bond Buyer 40, came to yield as   
much as 103% of a comparable Treasury bond's yield. Historically, this

     a deal of over $50 million. Bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax or

WHAT DOES "TAXABLE EQUIVALENT" MEAN FOR YOU?                                    

For yield and distribution rate, the taxable equivalent is the amount a taxable 
investment would have to earn to match a tax-free investment such as municipal  
bonds.* You can find your Fund's taxable equivalent distribution rate and yield 
in the Performance Summary of each Fund's report.                               

*    For investors subject to the federal or state alternative minimum tax, a   
     portion of this income may be subject to such tax. Distributions of capital
gains and of ordinary income from accrued market discount, if any, are
generally taxable.                                                    

ratio is about 90%.(2) Since municipals are tax-exempt, generally they yield    
less than Treasuries, which are subject to federal income tax. When municipal   
bonds are yielding approximately the same as Treasuries, investors are able to  
take advantage of the tax exemption at little extra cost. Depending on your     
federal and state tax rates, a taxable investment of comparable credit quality  
would need to offer a higher yield, called the taxable equivalent yield, to     
match the yield on a tax-free investment.                                       

Looking forward, we view the municipal bond market positively. We saw an        
increase in demand over the past two quarters, which contributed to solid       
performance over the one-year reporting period. Demand increased due to the     
favorable interest rate environment in 2000, as well as unfavorable equity      
market performance. We saw investors shift from a heavy focus on growth to a    
more traditional, diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash, as an        
investment strategy. Although we experienced a U.S. economic slowdown, state and
local government finances through the period were very strong, allowing them    
greater financial flexibility in times of slower growth. Most importantly, we   
believe municipal bonds will continue to be desirable due to the tax            
efficiencies they offer. Predicting market cycles is very difficult, even for   
professional economists -- which is why we recommend investing for the          
long-term. It is                                                                

4

important to remember that over time, the tax-free income received from         
municipal bond funds will ultimately drive the funds' total return performance. 
Overall, we believe our professionally managed portfolios can provide investors 
with high credit quality, and valuable tax-free income, for the long term.      

Sincerely,

Frequently asked questions about the dividend policy of Franklin tax-free income
funds.                                                                          

Have you ever wondered how your fund earns tax-free income and how much of that 
income is actually paid to you? Or, have you questioned why your monthly        
dividends fluctuate? Below you'll find answers to these and other commonly asked
questions about dividends paid by Franklin's tax-free funds.                    

Q.  WHAT'S FRANKLIN TAX-FREE FUNDS' DIVIDEND POLICY AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT MY   
DIVIDEND PAYMENTS?                                                      

A.  Franklin tax-free income funds attempt to set dividends on a quarterly      
basis. This means that once a quarter, in March, June, September and    
    December, we establish a fixed dividend amount per share that the funds will
distribute over the next three months. While the income the funds accrue
varies day-to-day, we do our best to maintain this fixed dividend each  
quarter to provide our shareholders with a stable income stream.

As you know, our goal is to invest for high, current tax-free income.   
 Franklin is one of the few fund companies that work to stabilize dividend
 payments for three months at a time. Many other tax-free funds distribute
dividends on daily income they accrue each month; meaning their dividend
payments can fluctuate every month.                                     

Q.  WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF THE INCOME MY FUND DISTRIBUTES TO ME AS TAX-FREE    
DIVIDENDS?                                                              

A.  Your fund earns tax-exempt interest income from its investments in municipal
  securities, or bonds. A municipal bond is an IOU issued by state and local
government agencies to raise money to fund public projects. The issuing 
   municipality makes interest payments to bondholders, in this case the fund,
to compensate them for the use of their money until the bond is repaid. 

Franklin's tax-free funds pay you this investment income as tax-free    
    dividends, less various operating expenses. As you know, these dividends are
    usually free from federal income taxes.* For a state-specific fund, they may
   also be free from that state's personal income taxes as well, to the extent
 dividends are earned from interest on that state's tax-free obligations.*

Sometimes, the fund may also pay you accumulated dividends that were not
previously distributed.                                                 

* Alternative minimum taxes may apply.

Q.  WHAT OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT MY MONTHLY DIVIDENDS?                         

A.  Generally, interest rates are the biggest determinant of a tax-free fund's  
 earnings level and the amount of dividends paid to you. For example, when
  interest rates decline, a fund's investment earnings will decline, as cash
   flow into the fund must be invested at the lower rates. This means dividend
   payments will also decrease. However, since bond prices tend to move in the
    opposite direction of interest rates, your fund's net asset value (NAV) will
tend to increase, causing your shares to appreciate in price. Similarly,
when interest rates rise, the ability of the funds to increase their    
dividends will rise.                                                    

 Interest rate trends are primarily determined by economic factors such as
inflation, strength of the U.S. dollar and the pace of economic growth. 
 Strong economic growth can lead to inflation, and the Federal Reserve may
   raise interest rates to cool the economy, as we saw last year. On the other
hand, if the economy slows down, the Federal Reserve may lower interest 
rates to stimulate economic growth, as happened earlier this year.      

   Credit quality and maturity periods of the securities in a fund's portfolio
    also play a role in determining the amount of income available to distribute
to shareholders, as explained below.

Q.  WHY DO SOME TAX-FREE FUNDS PAY HIGHER DIVIDENDS THAN OTHERS?                

A.  Dividends are directly related to the composition of a fund's portfolio.    
First, the credit quality of securities held helps determine a fund's   
   dividend payment ability. High-yield municipal bond funds, for example, can
have higher dividend distributions than other tax-free funds. This is   
   because they hold lower credit-quality municipal bonds that must pay higher
yields than other securities to compensate investors for taking on      
additional risk. However, they're also subject to higher risk than funds
that hold higher quality bonds in their portfolios.                     

   Similarly, long-term bond holdings in a fund's portfolio tend to pay higher
interest income than short-term bonds to compensate for uncertainty     
associated with the future.                                             

Q.  HOW HAS THE CURRENT DECLINING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AFFECTED MONTHLY    
DIVIDEND PAYMENTS?                                                      

A.  When interest rates decline, municipal bond issuers often "call," or redeem,
their higher-yielding bonds and replace them with new, lower-yielding   
    securities so they can reduce the amount of interest they have to pay on the
   debt. Most municipal bonds are callable within 10 to 12 years after they're
  issued. Because interest rates have generally been declining over the past
15 years, our funds are experiencing bond calls on older, higher-income 
securities.

Consequently, many of Franklin's tax-free funds have had to reinvest    
proceeds from these called bonds into lower-yielding bonds, resulting in
  lower earnings (dividends). Because funds can only pay out what they earn,
many of our funds have had to reduce dividend payments.                 

As you can see in the chart below, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we
 were able to invest assets at approximately 8%. As these bonds matured or
were called, we've had to reinvest the proceeds at approximately 5-3/8%.
    Because we cannot invest cash flow at the higher levels, we've had to reduce
  dividends. We continue to pay out the income we earn, but our earnings are
lower today because we're reinvesting at a lower rate than was available
10-15 years ago.                                                        

Many of the securities being called today have provided high levels of  
  income over the past 10 years, as interest rates have trended down. Though
   we can't predict interest rate cycles, we'll continue to focus on producing
the highest monthly tax-free income possible through our disciplined    
management approach.

Q.  WHAT OTHER TYPES OF INCOME CAN MY FUND DISTRIBUTE?                          

A.  Your fund also earns income from short- and long-term capital gains, which  
 are taxable to shareholders, whether you reinvest them or receive them as
 cash. Though we work to reduce capital gains, in periods of sustained low
interest rates, they are often unavoidable.                             

While short-term capital gains (on securities held in a portfolio for 12
 months or less) are treated as ordinary income distributions and taxed at
  regular income tax rates, long-term capital gains (on securities held in a
 portfolio for more than 12 months) are taxed at lower rates. Sometimes, a
  fund may invest part of its portfolio in private activity bonds, which are
basically municipal bonds issued to finance private activity. Interest  
earned from such bonds is exempt from federal income tax, but it's a    
preference item when calculating your alternative minimum tax (AMT)     
    liability. So, as required by the Internal Revenue Code, this income must be
 added to your regular tax income to calculate your AMT income and AMT tax
liability, if any.                                                      

 In case your fund makes any capital gains distributions, you can find the
exact amount of the distributions on your Form 1099. For complete       
   information on your tax liabilities, we suggest you consult a qualified tax
professional.

Your Fund's Goal: Franklin California High Yield Municipal Fund seeks to provide
high, current income exempt from regular federal and California state personal  
income taxes by investing primarily in a portfolio of high-yielding, medium-,   
lower-, and non-rated California municipal securities.(1)

STATE UPDATE                                                                    

During the year under review, California's economy showed growth and strength   
despite facing adversity from its power crisis. The state's economy reported    
growth in every major sector. The services sector accounted for nearly half of  
the 440,000 jobs created in 2000, while the government sector contributed with  
expansion in public school employment. By May 2001, the state unemployment rate 
reached 4.9%, just slightly above the 4.4% national rate.(2)                    

Growing demand for energy resulted in skyrocketing costs for this increasingly  
valuable commodity. Initially, deregulation laws passed in 1996 prevented       
investor-owned utilities from raising                                           

1.  The Fund may invest as much as 100% of its assets in bonds whose interest   
payments are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. All or a   
significant portion of the income on these obligations may be subject to
    such tax. Distributions of capital gains and of ordinary income from accrued
market discount, if any, are taxable. In general, an investor is paid a 
higher yield to assume a greater degree of risk.

consumer rates to cover the increased cost of power. By January 2001, however,  
the state was forced to step in to address the electricity crisis. Governor Gray
Davis signed an emergency proclamation giving the state government the ability  
to purchase electricity at fluctuating short-term and spot wholesale prices for 
resale to retail customers of the investor-owned utilities. By May 2001, the    
state's general fund cash advances for power purchases totaled approximately $4 
billion.(3)                                                                     

In consideration of increasing energy costs and a slowing national economy's    
potential effects on California, the fiscal year 2002 budget proposal contained 
conservative estimates for General Fund revenue growth of a modest 3.3%.        
Anticipating a 3.5% growth rate in personal income tax collections, projections 
were well below the state's more than 9% growth rate anticipated in 2000.(4)    

The state continued to build for unforeseen expenditures with its Rainy Day     
Fund, which reached $7.2 billion at the conclusion of fiscal year 2000, roughly 
$6.3 billion above the budget target. Declining debt issuance for prison        
construction should also contribute to improving California's debt ratios.      
Relative to the rest of the nation, the state ranked 19th in net tax-supported  
debt per capita and 22nd in debt as a percentage of personal income.(4)         

During the 12 months under review, both Moody's(R) and Standard & Poor's(R), two
independent credit rating agencies, raised and

then lowered California's General Obligation (GO) bonds' credit rating. In      
September 2000, Moody's raised its rating from Aa3 to Aa2, and Standard & Poor's
upgraded the rating from AA- to AA.(5) In April 2001, Standard & Poor's lowered 
their AA rating to A+, citing uncertainty surrounding the energy crisis and its 
potential effects on the state's economy.(6) However, Standard & Poor's also    
asserted that while the state's repayment ability has been reduced by recent    
power expenditures, its budget should be adequate to pay the debt. In May 2001, 
Moody's also downgraded the state's credit rating, to Aa3 from Aa2.(3) It is    
important to note that California bonds, even with recent credit rating         
adjustments, continue to be rated investment grade.                             

Although the state has some considerable financial problems, we believe it also 
has the resources to solve them. The state's baseline economic growth prospects 
remain very strong. Improved business diversity, a vibrant export sector and a  
concentration of high-growth, knowledge-based industries are all factors        
contributing to California's robust economy. The state's historically high cash 
balances and budget reserves all contribute to the expectation that it will     
outperform the nation in the medium term. Several factors could temper          
California's credit strength: a relatively inflexible budget structure,         
potentially volatile revenue structure during periods of economic weakening, the
lack of a

formal mid-year spending adjustment mechanism and the negative impact a stock   
market correction could have on capital gains tax collection. California's power
crisis, combined with weakening economies around the world, in particular with  
trading partner Japan, impacted the state's economy more than the rest of the   
world's. However, a decade of expansion and growth, combined with planned       
long-term energy financing, should enable the state to maintain its             
investment-grade credit outlook.                                                

PORTFOLIO NOTES                                                                 
During the period under review, high yield municipal bond funds performed, on   
average, below their investment-grade counterparts. Widening credit spreads, or 
yield differences, between higher- and lower-rated credits contributed to their 
relative underperformance within the high yield market. In 1998, we found yield 
spreads between AAA-rated and non-rated bonds to be as low as 0.50%. Yet in     
early 2001, the majority of spreads ranged between 1.5% and 2.0%.(7) Wider      
spreads were due primarily to deterioration in a few sectors of the high yield  
municipal bond market, most notably health care, project finance and            
corporate-related debt.                                                         

Fortunately, the high yield market fallout also created many opportunities for  
us to find higher quality, non-rated bonds at

very attractive yields. With wider yield spreads, we believe the traditional,   
more essential sectors, such as transportation and land-secured bonds, offer    
very attractive returns. Within this environment, Franklin California High Yield
Municipal Bond Fund's Class A share price, as measured by net asset value, rose 
to $9.95 on May 31, 2001, from $9.52 on May 31, 2000.                           

The lower credit ratings assigned to California GO bonds should have little, if 
any, impact on Franklin California High Yield Municipal Fund. The Fund's        
exposure to the bonds in question is only a small portion of the portfolio, as  
the Fund's exposure to California GO bonds was less than 0.01% of total         
long-term investments on May 31, 2001.                                          

With Franklin's presence in the municipal bond market, the Fund has a distinct  
advantage in structuring and controlling issues to fit its needs. Most dealers, 
underwriters and issuers know and trust Franklin and will come to us to assist  
them in structuring and pricing new issues, giving the Fund the ability to help 
define the marketplace's characteristics. Our size, research and experience in  
the municipal arena allow us to be very selective. An example of our influence  
was seen in a non-rated Richmond assessment district bond that we recently      
purchased. It was a $12 million deal issued to fund infrastructure improvements 
for a small, 650-unit development in Richmond, California. Our relationship with
the developer, SCS Development Company, enabled us to have an exclusive look at 
the entire issue. The city, the underwriter and the developer all worked with   
Franklin

to structure a deal that would be fair to all parties. In return, we were able  
to purchase all the bonds at 7.20%. To date, over 25% of the homes in the       
assessment district have been built and sold at prices significantly higher than
projected. Our influence in the municipal bond market allowed us to construct a 
deal that was at a very attractive yield and thus, advantageous for our         
shareholders.                                                                   

Historically, municipal bonds as an asset class are second only to stocks in    
after-tax returns, and have the benefit of low volatility.(8) At the end of the 
reporting period, municipal bonds offered attractive yields and a significant   
tax advantage over a comparable taxable investment. On May 31, 2001, the Bond   
Buyer Municipal Bond Index (Bond Buyer 40), an indicator of municipal bond      
market performance, yielded 5.42%, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yielded 
5.38%, resulting in a municipal bond-to-Treasury yield ratio of 111%, higher    
than the 93% historical average.(9) The Performance Summary beginning on page 20
shows the Fund's Class A shares' distribution rate was 5.49%, based on an       
annualization of the current 4.75 cent ($0.0475) per share dividend and the     
maximum offering price of $10.39 on May 31, 2001. This tax-free rate is         
generally higher than the after-tax return on a comparable taxable investment.  
An investor in the maximum combined federal and California state personal income
tax bracket of 45.22% would need to earn 10.02% from a taxable investment to    
match the Fund's tax-free distribution rate. The Performance Summary also shows 
the distribution rates and taxable equivalent distribution rates for Class B and
C shares.

9.  Source: The Bond Buyer, 6/1/01. The unmanaged Bond Buyer Municipal Bond     
  Index is composed of the yield to maturity of 40 bonds. The index attempts
 to track the new-issue market as closely as possible, so it changes bonds
twice a month, adding all new bonds that meet certain requirements and  
 deleting an equivalent number according to their secondary market trading
   activity. As a result, the average par call date, average maturity date and
average coupon rate change over time. The average maturity has generally
   been about 29-30 years. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate
  of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal
are guaranteed.

Looking ahead, we believe the steady demand for new-issue municipal bonds could 
improve municipal bond fund performance for the remainder of 2001. Continued    
corporate earnings pressure and the historically high stock market volatility   
seen in the first quarter of 2001 underscores the benefit of being a share-

holder in one of Franklin's large, broadly diversified and well-managed         
municipal bond funds. We believe municipal bonds offer stability, and we expect 
continued demand for them as investors seek broadened asset allocation          
strategies. With economic growth slowing and the Fed expected to continue       
interest rate cuts, it will be important to watch how manufacturing weakness    
will impact the unemployment rate, which in turn impacts consumer spending and  
confidence. Additionally, rising productivity and growing inventory could dampen
inflation and improve bond market performance. For the long term, we believe the
Fund should perform well as we maintain our conservative, buy-and-hold          
investment philosophy.

FRANKLIN CALIFORNIA HIGH YIELD MUNICIPAL FUND 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASS A: Subject to the current, maximum 4.25% initial sales charge. Prior to   
7/1/94, Fund shares were offered at a higher initial sales charge; thus actual  
total returns may be slightly lower.*                                           

CLASS B: Subject to no initial sales charge, but subject to a contingent        
deferred sales charge (CDSC) declining from 4% to 0% over six years. These      
shares have higher annual fees and expenses than Class A shares.*               

CLASS C: Subject to 1% initial sales charge and 1% CDSC for shares redeemed     
within 18 months of investment. These shares have higher annual fees and        
expenses than Class A shares.*                                                  

*The Fund's manager has agreed in advance to waive a portion of its management  
fees and to make certain payments to reduce expenses. If the manager had not    
taken this action, the Fund's total return would have been lower. The fee waiver
may be discontinued at any time upon notice to the Fund's Board of Directors.

1. Cumulative total return represents the change in value of an investment over 
the periods indicated and does not include sales charges.                       

2. Average annual total return represents the average annual change in value of 
an investment over the periods indicated and includes the current, applicable,  
maximum sales charge(s) for that class.                                         

3. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide standardized average annual total   
return information through the latest calendar quarter.                         

4. Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the respective class's     
current monthly dividend and the maximum offering price (NAV for Class B) per   
share on 5/31/01.                                                               

5. Taxable equivalent distribution rate and yield assume the published rates as 
of 1/24/01 for the maximum combined federal and California state personal income
tax bracket of 45.22%, based on the federal income tax rate of 39.6%.           

6. Yield, calculated as required by the SEC, is based on the earnings of the    
Fund's portfolio for the 30 days ended 5/31/01.                                 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bond prices, and thus the Fund's share price, generally move in the opposite    
direction from interest rates. Since markets can go down as well as up,         
investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and
you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

FOR HYPOTHETICAL $10,000 INVESTMENT                                             

Total return represents the change in value of an investment over the periods   
shown. It includes the current, applicable, maximum sales charge(s), Fund       
expenses, account fees and reinvested distributions. The unmanaged index        
includes reinvested interest. It differs from the Fund in composition and does  
not pay management fees or expenses. One cannot invest directly in an index. The
Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a commonly used measure of the inflation rate.

Your Fund's Goal: Franklin Tennessee Municipal Bond Fund seeks to provide high, 
current income exempt from regular federal and Tennessee state personal income  
taxes while seeking preservation of capital by investing primarily in a         
portfolio of Tennessee municipal securities.(1)

STATE UPDATE                                                                    

During the year under review, Tennessee's economy continued to diversify,       
producing modest economic growth. Aiding this was the state's moderate level of 
outstanding debt, with debt to personal income of approximately 1.0%, less than 
half the 2.2% national average, and debt per capita of $227, well below the $540
state median.(2) However, the future looks a little cloudier, given Tennessee's 
structural budget imbalances and the nation's slowing economy.                  

Tennessee's total fiscal year 2001 budget of $7.8 billion included a $368.9     
million budget disparity that was made up through reductions in spending and    
$105 million of one-time revenues. In each of the past three fiscal years, the  
state has had to rely on nonrecurring revenues to balance its budget, reflecting
its weak operating structural practices. The state's reliance on sales tax      
collections, representing 57% of revenues, hurt its finances, as                

1. The Fund may invest as much as 100% of its assets in bonds whose interest    
payments are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. All or a           
significant portion of the income on these obligations may be subject to such   
tax. Distributions of capital gains and of ordinary income from accrued market  
discount, if any, are taxable.

the slowing national economy translated into lower tax receipts. Tennessee      
recently estimated that if the economy continues to weaken, 2001's year-end     
deficit could reach $300 million.(3)                                            

Largely as a result, Standard & Poor's, an independent credit rating agency,    
downgraded Tennessee's general obligation (GO) debt from AAA to AA+ in June     
2000, reflecting that agency's concerns that revenue imbalances are likely to   
continue into fiscal year 2002.(4) Nevertheless, even with the downgrade,       
Tennessee still garners the agency's second-highest rating.                     

The state's budget imbalances have been the result of enhancements in education,
state employee pay raises, and most importantly, TennCare, the state's health   
care program for residents who are Medicaid-eligible, uninsured or uninsurable. 
Started in 1994, TennCare now supports 1.3 million residents, almost one-fourth 
of the state's population, and makes up approximately 24% of budget             
expenditures. TennCare's costs have increased by 14.7% annually for the past    
three years, easily surpassing overall tax revenue growth.(4)                   

Facing these challenges, Tennessee is actively working on a solution to its     
structural budget shortfalls. The government recently proposed a change to the  
sales tax structure, which would lower tax rates but also broaden the scope of  
what could be taxed to include nearly all goods and services. In addition, the  
legislature is working to match recurring revenues with recurring expenditures  
through diversifying revenues or adjusting spending priorities.

*Assumes shares were purchased and held for the entire accrual period. Since    
dividends accrue daily, your actual distributions will vary depending on the    
date you purchased your shares and any account activity during the month. Income
distributions include all accrued income earned by the Fund during the reporting
period.                                                                         

rates made it crucial that we invest the new assets quickly to protect the      
dividend. Because of the relatively light new-issue supply during the year, the 
task of finding worthy investments presented a challenge. Fortunately, the      
Fund's size and leverage in the Tennessee market enabled us to get the first    
look at new offerings in the primary and secondary markets.                     

Franklin Tennessee Municipal Bond Fund performed well during the 12 months ended
May 31, 2001, and the Fund's Class A share price, as measured by net asset      
value, increased from $10.02 on May 31, 2000, to $10.82 at period-end. However, 
generally declining interest rates during the Fund's fiscal year presented      
occasions for many municipal issuers to refinance their outstanding, higher     
yielding debt with current, lower cost bonds. Due to this refinancing, various  
higher coupon bonds in the portfolio were called. The Fund used the resulting   
proceeds to invest in securities available in the current, lower interest rate  
environment. Such incidents placed pressure on the Fund's earnings and made it  
necessary for us to decrease the Fund's dividend distribution beginning in June 
2001. For a more detailed discussion about our dividend policy, please see      
"Making Sense of Dividends," beginning on page 6.                               

We aimed to invest new assets in bonds with at least 10-year call protection to 
protect the Fund's long-term income stream. We continued to feel that high      
credit quality bonds with AA and AAA ratings represented the best value in the  
marketplace during the Fund's fiscal year. Overall, AAA-rated securities        
represented 54.9% of the portfolio on May 31, 2001. These purchases helped      
maintain the portfolio's high credit quality, and at period-end, the Fund       
boasted an average credit rating of AA+.                                        

During the period under review, we bought issues in a number of different       
sectors, preserving broad portfolio diversification. GO bonds and utilities     
issues remained the Fund's largest sector

allocations at the end of the period, comprising 25.2% and 19.4% of total       
long-term investments. New positions added during the period included           
Chattanooga GO, Memphis GO, Jackson Natural Gas Revenue and West Wilson Utility 
District bonds.                                                                 

Keep in mind that your Fund combines the advantage of high credit quality with  
tax-free yields.(1) The Performance Summary beginning on page 28, shows that at 
the end of this reporting period, the Fund's Class A shares' distribution rate  
was 4.83%, based on an annualization of the current 4.55 cent ($0.0455) per     
share dividend and the maximum offering price of $11.30 on May 31, 2001. An     
investor in the maximum combined federal and Tennessee state personal income tax
bracket of 43.22% would need to earn 8.51% from a taxable investment to match   
the Fund's tax-free distribution rate.                                          

Looking ahead, new-issue municipal bond supply should increase as issuers take  
advantage of recent, relatively low interest rates to issue refunding bonds to  
refinance their outstanding debt with current, lower cost bonds. Issuers will   
also take advantage of this low interest rate environment to finance much-needed
infrastructure because of the low cost of capital. Demand remains strong given  
the equity market volatility and municipal bonds' strong performance in 2000. We
will continue to actively manage the Fund's call exposure as we seek to maintain
a solid distribution yield to our shareholders.

CLASS A: Subject to the maximum 4.25% initial sales charge. The Fund's manager  
agreed in advance to waive a portion of its management fees.                    
If the manager had not taken this action, the Fund's distribution rate and total

3. In accordance with SEC rules, we provide standardized average annual total   
return information through the latest calendar quarter.                         

4. Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the current 4.55 cent per  
share monthly dividend and the maximum offering price of $11.30 per share on    
5/31/01.                                                                        

5. Taxable equivalent distribution rate and yield assume the published rates as 
of 1/24/01 for the maximum combined federal and Tennessee state tax bracket of  
43.22%, based on the federal income tax rate of 39.6%.                          

6. Yield, calculated as required by the SEC, is based on the earnings of the

Bond prices, and thus the Fund's share price, generally move in the opposite    
direction from interest rates. Since markets can go down as well as up,         
investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and
you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

TOTAL RETURN INDEX COMPARISON FOR HYPOTHETICAL $10,000 INVESTMENT               

Total return represents the change in value of an investment over the periods   
shown. It includes the maximum sales charge, Fund expenses, account fees and    
reinvested distributions. The unmanaged index includes reinvested interest. It  
differs from the Fund in composition and does not pay management fees or        
expenses. One cannot invest directly in an index. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
is a commonly used measure of the inflation rate.

various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be        
visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such
issues.                                                                         

Aa: High quality by all standards. Together with the Aaa group, they comprise   
what generally are known as high-grade bonds. Aa bonds are rated lower than Aaa 
because margins of protection may not be as large, fluctuation of protective    
elements may be of greater amplitude, or there may be other elements which make 
the long-term risks appear larger.                                              

A: Possess many favorable investment attributes and are considered upper        
medium-grade obligations. Factors giving security to principal and interest are 
considered adequate, but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility 
to impairment sometime in the future.                                           

Baa: Medium-grade obligations, i.e., they are neither highly protected nor      
poorly secured. Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the
present, but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be               
characteristically unreliable over any great length of time.                    

                                                                              31

Ba: Contain speculative elements. Often the protection of interest and principal
payments may be very moderate and, thereby, not well safeguarded during both    
good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds 
in this class.                                                                  

B: Generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment. Assurance of     
interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract
over any long period of time may be small.                                      

Caa: Poor standing. Such issues may be in default, or elements of danger with   
respect to principal or interest may be present.                                

Ca: Obligations that are highly speculative. Such issues are often in default or
have other marked shortcomings.                                                 

C: Lowest-rated class of bonds. Issues rated C can be regarded as having        
extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing.        

S&P(R)                                                                          

AAA: The highest rating assigned by S&P to a debt obligation and indicates the  
ultimate degree of protection as to principal and interest.                     

AA: Also qualify as high-grade obligations, and, in the majority of instances,  
differ from AAA issues only in a small degree.                                  

A: Generally regarded as upper medium-grade. They have considerable investment  
strength but are not entirely free from adverse effects of changes in economic  
and trade conditions. Interest and principal are regarded as safe.              

BBB: Regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay principal and interest.     
Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters, adverse economic  
conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened      
capacity to pay

principal and interest for bonds in this category than for bonds in the A       
category.                                                                       

BB, B, CCC, CC: Regarded, on balance, as predominantly speculative with respect 
to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with 
the terms of the obligations. BB indicates the lowest degree of speculation and 
CC the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds likely will have some    
quality and protective characteristics, these are outweighed by large           
uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions.                    

C: Reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid.                

D: In default, and payment of interest and/or repayment of principal is in      
arrears.                                                                        

                                                                              33

FRANKLIN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES TRUST                                             
Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

Franklin Municipal Securities Trust (the Trust) is registered under the         
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, open-end investment        
company, consisting of two series (the Funds). The Funds' investment objectives 
are to provide tax-free income.                                                 

The following summarizes the Funds' significant accounting policies.            

a. SECURITY VALUATION:                                                          

Tax-free bonds generally trade in the over-the-counter market and are valued    
within the range of the latest quoted bid and asked prices. In the absence of a 
sale or reported bid and asked prices, information with respect to bond and note
transactions, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in comparable   
securities, and various relationships between securities are used to determine  
the value of the security. The Trust may utilize a pricing service, bank or     
broker/dealer experienced in such matters to perform any of the pricing         
functions under procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Securities for    
which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as   
determined by management in accordance with procedures established by the Board 
of Trustees.                                                                    

b. INCOME TAXES:                                                                

No provision has been made for income taxes because each Fund's policy is to    
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income.                             

c. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS:        

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.     
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Bond discount and     
premium are amortized on an income tax basis. Dividends from net investment     
income are normally declared daily and distributed monthly to shareholders.     

Common expenses incurred by the Trust are allocated among the Funds based on the
ratio of net assets of each fund to the combined net assets. Other expenses are 
charged to each fund on a specific identification basis.                        

Realized and unrealized gains and losses and net investment income, other than  
class specific expenses, are allocated daily to each class of shares based upon 
the relative proportion of net assets of each class.                            

d. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES:                                                        

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make  
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and        
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income   
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

In November 2000, a revised AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of         
Investment Companies, was issued, and is effective for fiscal years beginning   
after December 15, 2000. The revised Guide will require the Funds to amortize   
all premium and discount on fixed-income securities. Such amortization will be  
included in net investment income but will not impact the net assets or the     
distributions of the Funds. As of May 31, 2001, the Funds estimate that the     
initial adjustment required upon adoption of premium and discount amortization  
will increase the recorded cost of their investments as listed below:

Franklin Tennessee Municipal Bond Fund have deferred capital losses occurring   
subsequent to October 31, 2000 of $5,609,282 and $22,539, respectively. For tax 
purposes, such losses will be reflected in the year ending May 31, 2002.        

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of defaulted securities and bond discounts.         

Net realized losses differ for financial statement and tax purposes primarily   
due to differing treatments of bond workout expenditures and bond discounts.

6. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES                                         

The California High Yield Municipal Fund and Franklin Tennessee Municipal Bond  
Fund have 44.6% and .03%, respectively, of their portfolio invested in below    
investment grade and comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which    
tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities.  
The risk of loss due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for  
the holders of high yielding securities because such securities are generally   
unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. At May
31, 2001, the Franklin California High Yield Municipal Fund and the Franklin    
Tennessee Municipal Bond Fund held defaulted securities with a value aggregating
$9,064,200 and $25,000 representing 1.61% and .03% respectively, of the Funds'  
net assets. For information as to specific securities, see the accompanying     
Statement of Investments.                                                       

For financial reporting purposes, the Funds discontinue accruing income on      
defaulted bonds and provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable.

FRANKLIN MUNICIPAL SECURITIES TRUST                                             

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the statements of investments, and the related statements of operations and of  
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all       
material respects, the financial position of each of the funds constituting the 
Franklin Municipal Securities Trust, (hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at  
May 31, 2001, the results of each of their operations for the year then ended,  
the changes in each of their net assets for each of the two years in the period 
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods presented, in   
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Funds' management;  
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in         
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of   
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material           
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the          
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and    
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits, which included confirmation of securities at May 31, 2001 by            
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for   
our opinion.

For all Funds, the State and U.S. Territory Risks U.S. Territories Puerto Rico. section is revised as follows: 19 Puerto Rico. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, along with its related issuers, are among the largest and most widely held issuers of municipal bonds, due in part to such bonds exemption from federal, local and state taxes in all U.S. states. However, certain municipal issuers in Puerto Rico have continued to experience significant financial difficulties. Credit rating firms, Standard & Poor s, Fitch Ratings, and Moody s Investors Service, have downgraded their respective ratings of Puerto Rico s general obligation debt further below investment grade, along with the ratings of certain related Puerto Rico issuers. On September 10, 2015, Standard & Poor s downgraded Puerto Rico s general obligation rating to CC. On July 1, 2015, Moody s downgraded Puerto Rico s general obligation rating to Caa3, following a June 2015 downgrade by Fitch Ratings to CC. Additionally, several of the other credit agencies have maintained a negative outlook on certain Puerto Rico issuers. Although the Fund has not been required to sell securities that have been downgraded to below investment grade, it is prohibited from making further purchases of any securities not rated investment grade by at least one U.S. nationally recognized rating service. In June 2014, Governor Padilla signed into law the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act (Act), citing a "fiscal emergency" relating to certain of its public corporations. According to the governor, the Act was meant to provide a legal framework that can be used by certain Puerto Rico public corporations, including Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), to seek protection from creditors and to reorganize and restructure their debt should they become insolvent. Although Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, neither Puerto Rico nor its subdivisions or agencies are currently eligible to file under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to seek protection from creditors or restructure their debt. The Act, by its terms, does not apply to the commonwealth's general obligation debt, sales tax-backed bonds (COFINA) or the debt of other agencies that is implicitly or explicitly backed by the commonwealth. Among other things, the Act would allow a minority of bondholders to bind the entire class of such holders and would allow investor collateral to be used for other purposes. In the event that a public corporation becomes insolvent and takes advantage of the Act, holders of such public corporation's debt, such as the Fund, could lose certain of their rights as creditors of the public corporation. Bondholders likely would not receive timely payment of all principal and interest due to them, and in some cases, may not receive any further payments of principal and interest. In addition, the value of such debt would be impacted, which could affect the Fund's liquidity and performance. In June 2014, certain Franklin Templeton mutual funds, along with other unaffiliated funds, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act is unconstitutional and not enforceable. In February 2015, the District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ruled the Act to be unconstitutional. Puerto Rico appealed the decision and on July 6, 2015, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear Puerto Rico s appeal of the lower courts rulings and oral arguments are expected in Other than the Act, no statute expressly allows Puerto Rico to pursue a public bankruptcy or reorganization. As an alternative to the Act, certain members of Congress and others are advocating for the passage of bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate, which would amend Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to permit Puerto Rico and its public corporations to file for bankruptcy. It is uncertain whether any of these bills, or similar proposals that may be introduced in the future, will ultimately be passed into law and if so, what the specific provisions would be. If any such proposal were enacted, it might restrict or eliminate the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objectives. Beginning in August 2014, PREPA, Puerto Rico s main supplier of electricity, has participated in ongoing discussions with its creditors, including certain Franklin Templeton mutual funds, about a framework to address PREPA s financial and operational challenges. As part of these discussions, bondholders constituting approximately 60% of PREPA's bondholders agreed not to commence legal proceedings or exercise certain rights relating to claims of default in order to permit the negotiation of a possible financial restructuring. In December 2015, certain Franklin Templeton mutual funds, along with other holders totaling approximately 60% of outstanding debt, signed a Restructuring Support Agreement (the RSA ) that would provide for, among other things, a restructuring of PREPA debt. Implementation of this agreement was subject to various conditions and approvals, including the need of the Puerto Rico legislature to approve legislation to establish a securitization framework for new PREPA debt. After the legislature was unable to pass PREPA securitization legislation by the initial January 22, 2016 deadline set forth in one of the conditions, the RSA was terminated. PREPA and the creditors entered into a new RSA on January 27, 2016 which incorporated most of the terms of the prior RSA with certain amendments, including the 210 extension of the deadline to pass the securitization legislation to February 16, The securitization legislation received all required approvals when the Puerto Rico Senate approved it on February 10, 2016, the Puerto Rico House approved it on February 15, 2016, and the legislation was signed by the governor of Puerto Rico on February 16, The results of this legislation could impact the value of debt issued by PREPA, which could affect the Fund's liquidity and performance. On July 16, 2015, S&P further downgraded the rating of Puerto Rico s Government Development Bank, after its president described an intention to do a debt exchange, possibly at levels less than par. Additionally, the Puerto Rico Public Finance Corporation did not make full debt service payments due on the first business day of each month from August 2015 through January These bonds required an appropriation by the legislature to pay debt service, and an appropriation to make this payment was not included in the fiscal year 2016 budget approved in June On December 1, 2015, the governor announced he would utilize existing law to clawback certain governmental revenues that have previously been directed to other public authorities and redirect them to the commonwealth s general fund. Some of these revenues are used to pay certain bond debt service of those authorities. As a result, on January 4, 2016, the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Finance Authority defaulted on its bonds payable from federal excise taxes on rum. It is unclear at this time if and when the clawback will result in a monetary default by other public agencies. On February 1, 2016, The Working Group for the Fiscal and Economic Recovery of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico released a Restructuring Proposal which proposes to exchange certain debt of the commonwealth and related issuers for new bonds. Franklin Templeton mutual funds, together with their advisers, are considering the terms of the proposal. Puerto Rico's economy has traditionally tracked that of the U.S. mainland. However, Puerto Rico entered its own recession in 2006 ahead of the mainland, and Puerto Rico has yet to recover. The island's unemployment rate at fiscal year-end 2009 was 13.7% before growing to a high of 16.3% at fiscal year-end It has dropped over the past few years to 12.8% at fiscal year-end 2014 and is estimated at 12.5% as of November As of the April 2015 estimate, the Puerto Rico Planning Board projects that real GNP declined by 0.2% in fiscal year 2013 and 0.9% in fiscal year Estimates for 2015 and 2016 reflect a further contraction of 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. Other than slight growth of 0.5% in 2012, the economy contracted in every fiscal year between 2007 and Total non-farm payroll employment (seasonally adjusted) has increased a projected 0.7% on a year-over-year basis as of November Non-farm payroll employment declined an estimated 2.7% in 2013 and declined an estimated 0.1% in The largest employment sectors include services (38%), government (26%), trade (19%) and manufacturing (8%). While the manufacturing sector only makes up 8% of employment, it is the largest sector in terms of gross domestic product. According to preliminary 2014 data, the manufacturing sector contributed 47.6% of total GDP. The manufacturing sector has undergone some major changes. Pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and technology became growth areas in the 1990s, but this trend has reversed since then, with manufacturing employment declining 38% from fiscal years 2007 to Tourism, an important component of the Puerto Rico economy, had improved through early However, with the U.S. recession, tourism slowed down, having a negative effect on Puerto Rico s economy and tax revenues. Average fiscal year hotel occupancy rates previously peaked at 71.7% in 2007 before dropping to 66.2% in Hotel occupancy has been slowly rebounding and was a projected 72.2% as of October 2015, down slightly from 75.7% as of April Total hotel registrations dipped from , but increased 5.1% in fiscal year 2010, 5.6% in 2011, 9.1% in 2012, 0.3% in 2013 and 3.4% in As of October 2015, the year-over-year growth was 4.6%. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of Puerto Rico decreased by 2.2% from 2000 to 2010, and by a preliminary 4.7% from 2010 to This loss is driven in large part by migration to the United States mainland. The commonwealth has had deficit financial results for well over a decade. The deficit operations resulted from incorrect revenue assumptions, underestimated spending levels, lack of financial management, poor collection rates 311 and a weak economy, among other things. The Fortuño Administration took over in January 2009, with the challenge of dealing with a projected $3.2 billion deficit for fiscal year The governor announced and began implementing a multi-year Fiscal Stabilization and Economic Reconstruction Plan to comprehensively overhaul the government, both financially and organizationally. The main components of the plan included job cuts, several temporary tax increases, increased tax enforcement, a reorganization of the government and a combination of the federal and a local stimulus plan. This administration made improvements, but the commonwealth still had deficit operations and required the use of debt to meet annual spending needs. The commonwealth has not produced audited financial statements since June In January 2013, the Padilla Administration took office. In its first year in office, the administration increased and extended the excise tax which was being phased out, increased the sales tax base, increased several taxes and passed sweeping pension reform. The fiscal year 2015 general fund budgetary revenues are projected at $8.961 billion which is just under fiscal year 2014 revenues and approximately $604 million below budget, with estimated expenditures at $9.656 billion resulting in a deficit of $703 million. The commonwealth s liquidity position is very weak. Because the government's weak credit quality has led to higher borrowing costs as well as market volatility, the government has chosen to use short-term private placements to manage the government s liquidity. Puerto Rico issued more than $3.5 billion of traditional long-term debt in March 2014 and another $1.2 billion of short-term direct loans and private placements in October 2014 to help manage liquidity. Puerto Rico has announced its intention to issue up to $2.9 billion through the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority to refinance a number of loans between the Government Development Bank and the Highways and Transportation Authority or issue Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes. The Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority bonds would be secured by a portion of the recently increased petroleum business tax, but the timing and details of either issuance are unclear at this time. To help improve liquidity, Puerto Rico has approved legislation that would allow it to eliminate monthly set-asides for general obligation debt service if this bond deal does not occur. Additional legislation would also allow Puerto Rico to borrow from certain public corporations instead of issuing public debt in the bond market. In May 2015, the legislature and governor agreed on a 4.5 percentage point increase to the sales and use tax beginning July 1, This brings the overall rate to 11.5% with 10% payable to the commonwealth and 1.5% payable to the municipalities. The sales and use tax would transition to a value added tax (VAT) by April 1, Included in this legislation was implementation of a 4% business services tax. These tax increases are expected to raise $1.2 billion. This tax increase formed the basis of the governor s proposed fiscal year budget. The original fiscal year 2016 $9.8 billion general fund budget included $4.2 billion for operational expenses, $4 billion in special allocations and $1.5 billion for debt service. In addition to the $1.2 billion from the recently adopted tax increase, the budget includes $674 million in spending cuts. In December 2015 the governor announced that budgeted revenues are now projected at $9.2 billion from a $9.4 billion revision in November. As of September 30, 2015, Puerto Rico s total public sector debt topped $70 billion. This figure includes not just general obligation debt but also debt secured by sales taxes as well as debt issued by Puerto Rico's public corporations and municipalities. Puerto Rico's debt per capita levels are at the higher end of the spectrum compared to U.S. states for two primary reasons. First, Puerto Rico generally centralizes the majority of its debt issuance at the territory level. These debt levels have increased as Puerto Rico financed significant capital and infrastructure improvements. And second, the commonwealth has relied on the capital markets for funding of current year expenses. Puerto Rico s government debt (direct government debt) has a first claim on available revenues under its Constitution. According to the preliminary June 30, 2014 actuarial report, Puerto Rico continues to maintain a very large unfunded pension liability and its primary pension fund had an estimated funded ratio of below 1% (using GASB 67) and its teachers retirement fund had a funded ratio of 11.5% (using GASB 67). It also had an estimated unfunded other post-employment benefits (OPEB) liability of $2.3 billion as of June 30, The commonwealth issued pension obligation bonds in early 2008, secured by future employer contributions. In March 2013, the governor and legislature approved sweeping pension reforms to Puerto Rico's general retirement system which should help mitigate the huge increases in annual funding required of the government when assets are depleted. This reform should reduce potential additional annual funding requirements from as high as $ million a year to closer to $200 million. The pension reforms were challenged, but the Puerto Rico Supreme Court upheld their 412 constitutionality in June In late 2013, the governor and legislature approved reforms to the Teachers Retirement System which were quickly challenged. In April 2014, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled the reforms were unconstitutional and the governor has yet to comment on any alternative plans. Despite this pension reform, the commonwealth still faces large pension requirements and a pension fund with an extremely large unfunded liability. Outstanding issues relating to the potential for a transition to statehood may also have broad implications for Puerto Rico and its financial and credit position. The U.S. House of Representatives has considered legislation that would allow the residents of Puerto Rico to vote on its political status. If approved by Congress, Puerto Rico would first hold a referendum asking residents if they prefer Puerto Rico to be a self-governing commonwealth or to change the island's status. If a majority were to vote for a different status, the island would then hold a second election to decide what status is desired. One of these options would be statehood. The president has recommended Congress appropriate money for Puerto Rico to hold a non-partisan election on the question of political status. It is not clear what the timeline, outcome or repercussions could be of such a vote. On June 29, 2015, the governor of Puerto Rico, citing a report commissioned by Puerto Rico and written by former World Bank and IMF officials, publicly described Puerto Rico s debt as unpayable and called for a debt restructuring and the expansion of Chapter 9 bankruptcy eligibility to Puerto Rico. Following the governor s comments, Moody s, Standard and Poor s and Fitch Ratings all downgraded Puerto Rico s general obligation debt further below investment grade, with S&P adding that the potential for a restructuring of some or all of the commonwealth's debt is a significant possibility over the next six months, and market prices of Puerto Rico debt obligations generally declined. On September 9, 2015, a governor-appointed commission released a Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan for Puerto Rico. This report was updated again on January 18 th. Although the report lacks detail, it calls for the restructuring of a portion of Puerto Rico s debt. It is unclear at this time what the implications are for the various Puerto Rico debt issuances.

Series Foreign Smaller Companies Series Global Equity Series The Statement of Additional Information is amended as follows: I. For Templeton Foreign Smaller Companies Fund, Templeton Global Balanced Fund, Foreign Equity Series, Foreign Smaller Companies Series and Global Equity Series, the Glossary of Investments, Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks Foreign securities section is amended by adding the following before Developing markets or emerging markets: Investing through Stock Connect. Foreign investors may now invest in eligible China A shares ( Stock Connect Securities ) listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange ( SSE ) through the Shanghai Hong Kong Stock Connect ( Stock Connect ) program. Stock Connect is a securities trading and clearing program developed by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ( SEHK ), SSE, Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited and China Securities15 Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited for the establishment of mutual market access between SEHK and SSE. In contrast to certain other regimes for foreign investment in Chinese securities, no individual investment quotas or licensing requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect Securities through Stock Connect. In addition, there are no lock-up periods or restrictions on the repatriation of principal and profits. However, trading through Stock Connect is subject to a number of restrictions that may affect the Fund s investments and returns. For example, a primary feature of the Stock Connect program is the application of the home market s laws and rules to investors in a security. Thus, investors in Stock Connect Securities are generally subject to Chinese securities regulations and SSE listing rules, among other restrictions. In addition, Stock Connect Securities generally may not be sold, purchased or otherwise transferred other than through Stock Connect in accordance with applicable rules. While Stock Connect is not subject to individual investment quotas, daily and aggregate investment quotas apply to all Stock Connect participants, which may restrict or preclude the Fund s ability to invest in Stock Connect Securities. For example, an investor cannot purchase and sell the same security on the same trading day. Stock Connect also is generally available only on business days when both the SSE and the SEHK are open. Trading in the Stock Connect program is subject to trading, clearance and settlement procedures that are untested in China, which could pose risks to the Fund. Finally, the withholding tax treatment of dividends and capital gains payable to overseas investors currently is unsettled. Stock Connect is in its initial stages. Further developments are likely and there can be no assurance as to whether or how such developments may restrict or affect the Fund s investments or returns. In addition, the application and interpretation of the laws and regulations of Hong Kong and China, and the rules, policies or guidelines published or applied by relevant regulators and exchanges in respect of the Stock Connect program, are uncertain, and they may have a detrimental effect on the Fund s investments and returns. II. The following bullet points are added to Buying and Selling Shares CDSC waivers section as follows: Redemptions through systematic plan, up to 1% monthly, 3% quarterly, 6% semiannually or 12% annually of your account s net asset value depending on the frequency of your plan Redemptions by Employer Sponsored Retirement Plans III. The following paragraph under the Buying and Selling Shares General information section is revised as follows: The Fund may be required (i) pursuant to a validly issued levy, to sell your shares and remit the proceeds to a levying officer or to turn your shares over to a levying officer who may, in turn, sell your shares at a public sale; or (ii) pursuant to a final order of forfeiture or other form of legal process to sell your shares and remit the proceeds to the U.S. or state government as directed. IV. The following paragraph is added to the Buying and Selling Shares General information section as follows: As long as we follow reasonable security procedures and act on instructions we reasonably believe are genuine, we will not be responsible for any losses that may occur from unauthorized requests in any form (written, telephone, online). We will investigate any unauthorized request that you report to us and we will ask you to cooperate with us in the investigation, which may require you to file a police report and complete a notarized affidavit regarding the unauthorized request. We will assist in the claims process, on your behalf, with other financial institutions regarding the unauthorized request. Please keep this supplement with your Statement of Additional Information for future reference.16 Goals, Strategies and Risks The following information provided with respect to the Fund is in addition to that included in the Fund s prospectus. In addition to the main types of investments and strategies undertaken by the Fund as described in the prospectus, the Fund also may invest in other types of instruments and engage in and pursue other investment strategies, which are described in this SAI. Investments and investment strategies with respect to the Fund are discussed in greater detail in the section below entitled Glossary of Investments, Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks. Generally, the policies and restrictions discussed in this SAI and in the prospectus apply when the Fund makes an investment. In most cases, the Fund is not required to sell an investment because circumstances change and the investment no longer meets one or more of the Fund s policies or restrictions. If a percentage restriction or limitation is met at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in the percentage due to a change in the value or liquidity of portfolio investments will not be considered a violation of the restriction or limitation, with the exception of the Fund s limitations on borrowing as described herein or unless otherwise noted herein. Incidental to the Fund s other investment activities, including in connection with a bankruptcy, restructuring, workout, or other extraordinary events concerning a particular investment the Fund owns, the Fund may receive equity securities (including convertible securities, warrants and rights), real estate or other investments that the Fund normally would not, or could not, buy. If this happens, the Fund may, although it is not required to, sell such investments as soon as practicable while seeking to maximize the return to shareholders. The Fund has adopted certain investment restrictions as fundamental and non-fundamental policies. A fundamental policy may only be changed if the change is approved by (i) more than 50% of the Fund s outstanding shares or (ii) 67% or more of the Fund s shares present at a shareholder meeting if more than 50% of the Fund s outstanding shares are represented at the meeting in person or by proxy, whichever is less. A non-fundamental policy may be changed without the approval of shareholders. For more information about the restrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) on the Fund with respect to borrowing and senior securities, see Glossary of Investments, Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks - Borrowing below. Fundamental Investment Policies The Franklin California High Yield Municipal Fund s (California High Yield Fund) principal investment goal is to provide investors with a high level of income exempt from federal and California personal income taxes. Its secondary goal is capital appreciation to the extent possible and consistent with its principal investment goal. The Franklin Tennessee Municipal Bond Fund s (Tennessee Fund) investment goal is to maximize income exempt from federal income taxes and from the personal income taxes for resident shareholders of Tennessee to the extent consistent with prudent investing and the preservation of shareholders capital. Under normal market conditions, the California High Yield Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest is free from regular federal income taxes. and California personal income taxes. Under normal market conditions, the Tennessee Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade municipal securities whose interest is free from regular federal income taxes.and from Tennessee personal income taxes. The Fund may not: 1. Borrow money, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, or any rules, exemptions or interpretations thereunder that may be adopted, granted or issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 2. Act as an underwriter, except to the extent the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter when disposing of securities it owns or when selling its own shares. 3. Make loans if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other persons, including other investment companies to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act or any rules, exemptions or interpretations thereunder that may be adopted, granted or issued by the SEC. This limitation does not apply to (i) the lending of portfolio securities, (ii) the purchase of debt securities, other debt instruments, loan participations and/or engaging in direct corporate loans in accordance with its investment goals and policies, and (iii) repurchase agreements to the extent the entry into a repurchase agreement is deemed to be a loan. 4. Purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments and provided that this restriction does not prevent the Fund from (i) purchasing or selling securities or instruments secured by real estate or interests therein, securities or instruments representing interests in real estate or securities or instruments of issuers that invest, deal or otherwise engage in transactions in real estate or interests therein, and (ii) making, purchasing or selling real estate mortgage loans. 5. Purchase or sell physical commodities, unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments and provided that this restriction does not prevent the Fund from (i) engaging in transactions involving currencies and futures contracts and options thereon or (ii) investing in securities or other instruments that are secured by physical commodities. 6. Issue senior securities, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act or any rules, exemptions or interpretations thereunder that may be adopted, granted or issued by the SEC. 217 7. Invest more than 25% of the Fund s net assets in securities of issuers in any one industry (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities or securities of other investment companies) Purchase the securities of any one issuer (other than the U.S. government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities or securities of other investment companies, whether registered or excluded from registration under Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act) if immediately after such investment (i) more than 5% of the value of the Fund s total assets would be invested in such issuer or (ii) more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer would be owned by the Fund, except that up to 25% of the value of the Fund s total assets may be invested without regard to such 5% and 10% limitations. 1. Although not part of the Fund s fundamental investment restriction, consistent with SEC Staff interpretations and guidance, governments or their political subdivisions that issue tax-exempt municipal securities are not considered by the Fund to be members of any industry. Non-Fundamental Investment Policies Municipal securities issued by a state or that state s counties, municipalities, authorities, agencies, or other subdivisions, as well as qualifying municipal securities issued by U.S. territories such as Guam, Puerto Rico, the Mariana Islands or the U.S. Virgin Islands, generally pay interest free from federal income tax and from state personal income taxes, if any, for residents of that state. The Fund tries to invest all of its assets in tax-free municipal securities. The issuer s bond counsel generally gives the issuer an opinion on the tax-exempt status of a municipal security when the security is issued. As a non-fundamental policy, the Fund may not invest in real estate limited partnerships. Additional Strategies The California High Yield Fund may invest in securities of issuers that are, or are about to be, involved in reorganizations, financial restructurings, or bankruptcy (generally referred to as distressed debt ), including defaulted securities if the investment manager believes the issuer may resume making interest payments or other favorable developments seem likely in the near future. The California High Yield Fund, however, currently does not intend to invest more than 10% of its assets in defaulted securities. The California High Yield Fund may invest in Mello-Roos bonds. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its assets in illiquid securities. Glossary of Investments, Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks Certain words or phrases may be used in descriptions of Fund investment policies and strategies to give investors a general sense of the Fund s levels of investment. They are broadly identified with, but not limited to, the following percentages of Fund total assets: small portion less than 10% portion 10% to 25% significant 25% to 50% substantial 50% to 66% primary 66% to 80% predominant 80% or more If the Fund intends to limit particular investments or strategies to no more than specific percentages of Fund assets, the prospectus or SAI will clearly identify such limitations. The percentages above are not limitations unless specifically stated as such in the Fund s prospectus or elsewhere in this SAI. The Fund may invest in securities that are rated by various rating agencies such as Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard & Poor s Financial Services (S&P ), as well as securities that are unrated. The value of your shares in the Fund will increase as the value of the investments owned by the Fund increases and will decrease as the value of the Fund s investments decreases. In this way, you participate in any change in the value of the investments owned by the Fund. In addition to the factors that affect the value of any particular investment that the Fund owns, the value of the Fund s shares may also change with movement in the investment markets as a whole. The following is a description of various types of securities, instruments and techniques that may be purchased and/or used by the Fund. Other types of municipal securities or strategies, not specifically described below, may become available or attractive that are similar to those described below and in which the Fund also may invest, if consistent with its investment goal and policies. Municipal securities general description Municipal securities are issued by a state or that state s counties, municipalities, authorities, agencies, or other subdivisions, as well as by the District of Columbia. These municipal securities generally pay interest free from federal income tax and from state personal income taxes, if any, for residents of that state. In addition, U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, the Mariana Islands or the U.S. Virgin Islands also issue qualifying municipal securities that generally pay interest free from federal income tax and from state personal income taxes. Generally for all municipal securities, the issuer pays a fixed, floating or variable rate of interest, and must repay the amount borrowed (the principal ) at maturity. Municipal securities are issued to raise money for a variety of public or private purposes, including financing state or local government, specific projects or public facilities. Municipal securities generally are classified as general or revenue obligations. The value of the municipal securities may be highly sensitive to events affecting the fiscal stability of the municipalities, agencies, authorities and other instrumentalities that issue securities. In particular, economic, legislative, regulatory or political developments affecting the ability of the issuers to pay 3  View more
