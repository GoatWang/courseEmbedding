Company












About Us
Acadia Realty Trust (NYSE:AKR) is an equity real estate investment trust focused on delivering long-term, profitable growth via its dual – core and opportunity fund – platforms. 
Our energized team is accomplishing this goal by building a best-in-class, location-driven core real estate portfolio with meaningful concentrations of assets in the nation’s most dynamic urban and street-retail corridors, including those in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, and Boston. At the same time, we are amplifying this portfolio’s solid growth by making highly-profitable opportunistic and value-add investments through our series of discretionary, institutional funds. For the trailing 15-year period ended December 31, 2014, Acadia’s stock achieved a cumulative total return of 1,388%, placing our company among the industry’s top-performing shopping center REITs. 

We attribute our success to our unique business model and to our uncompromising commitment to three core attributes:
1 WE STAY FOCUSED
We execute our strategy by focusing on four key business strengths: enhancing our core portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet, launching profitable external growth initiatives, and energizing the Acadia Team.
2 WE MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE
The very nature of our business is long-term, with horizons measured in years, not quarters. We wait patiently for the right opportunities to present themselves and make strategic decisions that are driven by our commitment to sustain growth over the long term.
3 WE PROVIDE VALUE
We believe that the value we consistently create and deliver is one of the attributes most admired by our varied constituency, consumers who shop in our centers, retailers who lease our properties, loyal shareholders who rely on our expertise, our business partners and the talented employees who are the face of Acadia.

STRONG FUNDAMENTALS + FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITY
Acadia Realty Trust is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT), which specializes in the operation, management, leasing, renovation, and acquisition of shopping centers and mixed-use
properties with retail components.





Our Investment Approach
Our core portfolio is located in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern United States and is structured to take advantage of densely populated, high barrier-to-entry and supply-constrained markets. Furthermore, the majority of our properties are anchored by necessity and discount/value retailers and thus less dependent on discretionary consumer spending. We also operate through a series of opportunity funds, through which we, as the general partner/member, together with institutional investors, invest in both opportunistic and value-add acquisitions. We are well-positioned to take advantage of profitable opportunities for growth. Our strengths include an experienced management team with a proven track record and a portfolio of high-quality retail properties.

Acquisitions - Acadia Realty Trust




































 




Acquisitions












Acadia Realty Trust actively pursues opportunities to fuel its external growth through the acquisition, ownership and redevelopment of retail properties including street retail, urban/infill properties with a strong retail component, as well as suburban shopping centers.
We have a national scope and target both single property and portfolio transactions in markets generally characterized by high barriers-to-entry, dense populations and a constrained retail supply. Today, our footprint primarily extends along the East Coast, from Boston to Miami, and also includes Chicago and San Francisco.
We pursue a dual investment strategy, focusing on both opportunistic/value-add and core/stabilized asset acquisitions. In particular, properties requiring redevelopment and/or re-tenanting are a strategic fit, taking advantage of our in-house leasing, construction, legal and management skills. In recent years, we have also successfully restructured debt and partnership positions, including assets that were subject to bankruptcy foreclosure. 
Due to the structure of our investment platform and our credit lines, we are able to act on new opportunities quickly and may close a transaction all cash, as necessary. Deals are structured with consideration to the needs of the seller, including tax-deferment.

                Acadia Realty Trust is a real estate investment trust, which specializes in the operation, management, leasing, renovation, and acquisition of shopping centers and mixed-use properties with retail components. The company operates through the following business segments: Core Portfolio, Funds and Structured Financing. The Core Portfolio segment consists of high quality street retail and urban assets, as well as suburban properties located in high barrier to entry, densely populated trade areas. The Funds segment handles fund investment. The Structured Financing segment invests in preferred equity investments that are collateralized by the underlying real estate, a direct interest or the borrower's ownership interest in the entities that own the properties or by the borrower's personal guarantee. The company was founded by Kenneth F. Bernstein in August 1998 and is headquartered in Rye, NY.

We’d like to offer some color around a few points you bring up… · It’s an extremelytough decision to have to let anyone go and it is one that we do not take lightly; but from time to time these types of decisions are in the best interest of the company. We pride ourselves on our low turnover rate of ~8% over the last five years, along with the average employee tenure of 7.4 years. · We are always working on ways to improve our on-boarding process and would agree that more can be done to encourage a focus on training to ensure each employees’ success at Acadia. This of course can vary between departments. · While many of our associates do enjoy taking their lunch together, work schedules do not always align. In an effort to create a central hub whereby increasing the likelihood of “casual collisions” we’ve designed a beautiful café that include diner style booths in our new headquarters, and they are packed daily with associates taking a work break or having lunch. Our Wellness team has done wonders to bring people together through fitness classes, volunteering in the community, and experiencing lunch-and-learns together. With the nature of real estate and the evolution of the workplace in general, the departments here often have different work schedules. Many are out at the properties together or in meetings in Manhattan, or on the road, so simply assessing a company’s culture based on one hour of lunchtime is just not the reality of the workforce any longer. · We are very proud of the generational diversity we have here at Acadia with the average employee age being 42 years old and encompassing four generations all working collaboratively and leveraging off of what each bring to the table. · The intern program began with our CEO’s vision of growing talent organically in addition to our strong commitment and history of promoting from within. It is a better use of resources to develop our own talent starting with those still in college and right out of school. It is also an incredible branding tool since the network of young employees in today’s world is stronger than ever. Every event that the interns participate in, with the exception of those that focus on interns networking with other company’s interns, are open to all Acadia Associates and participation is strongly encouraged. That’s our favorite part of the program - the current employees getting to talk about what they do with the interns and vice-versa. It is incorrect that we do not actually hire the interns. From only 5 years of having the intern program, 6 employees have already come on as full time associates through the program. Each of them has been a success in their departments. Not only does this program benefit the interns themselves, but the program provides another avenue for employees to hone their management skills and prove that they are capable of managing others which leads to more visibility in the office and therefore, even more reason for advancement. We encourage you to come speak with us if you have any concerns. Many people here spend countless days thinking of ways to improve our employees’ experience and based on the success of our real estate portfolio, our expanding offices, and the work that our employees produce, we feel that it is improving every day. Thank you for your review, Acadia Human Capital... MoreLess Acadia Realty Trust 2016-05-07 09:59 PDT Jan 21, 2016"Not good for young employees"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Development Analyst in White Plains, NYCurrent Employee - Development Analyst in White Plains, NYDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Acadia Realty Trust (More than 3 years)ProsYou get solid PTO but...cons>prosConsSmall company feeling with heavy division between groups, people often leave early or get replaced quickly, antisocial environment where noboddy eats lunch toether except one guy who is creepy and asks everyone "so guys, what is for lunch today" starting at 9:30am, churn em and burn em mentaility for younger employees, long hours in development and acquisitions, I choose to leave bc of slow growth ops, also the IT department is unhelpfulAdvice to ManagementLess micromanagement, try to retain younger employeesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Acadia Realty Trust Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Acadia Realty Trust 2016-01-21 23:10 PST Sep 14, 2015"job"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeProsgood time management and better standard of livingConsno profits or benefits from companyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Acadia Realty Trust Response Jun 21, 2016 – MarketingDear Employee, We appreciate you taking the time to leave a review. We’re happy that you’ve been enjoying the work environment here. We wanted to address the Cons you had, though. Acadiaactually does offer an Employee Share Purchase Program and many employees take advantage of that. We offer a robust benefits platform that include health, dental, life & disability, as well as a 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match. Further enhancing our benefits platform is our new wellness initiatives, that are getting better every year. We’ve updated the benefits page here on Glassdoor, so please take a look.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Acadia Realty Trust Closes Fund with Mega-Buying Power





























Acadia Realty Trust Closes Fund with Mega-Buying Power
The firm's fifth institutional retail fund closed with $520 million in commitments.

Kenneth Bernstein, Acadia
New York—Acadia Realty Trust has just announced the final closing of its Acadia Strategic Opportunity Fund V LLC institutional fund, with commitments totaling $520 million—a sum that translates to $1.5 billion for investment in opportunistic and value-add retail assets.
Fund V is following Acadia’s tried-and-true investment strategy of focusing on well-located street retail, next-generation street retail and distressed-retailer real estate. The equity REIT now has “new dry powder available to invest in compelling risk-reward opportunities over the next few years,” Kenneth Bernstein, president & CEO of Acadia, said in a prepared statement.
Acadia, which committed $104.5 million to Fund V, didn’t precisely have to hunt down investors, and the proof is in the numbers. Fund V was oversubscribed, surpassing its half-billion target by $20 million, and it closed within 30 days of its launch. History had more than a little to do with the expeditious wrap up. Acadia’s impressive track record with its four preceding retail-focused opportunity funds provided encouragement for existing investors in one or more of those vehicles to contribute to the fifth fund in the series. Accounting for a whopping 98 percent of Fund V’s third-party commitments, the long list of repeat offenders encompasses university endowments, foundations, pension funds, investment management firms and family offices.
Acadia’s closing of Fund V comes four years after the final close of Fund IV, which also received capital commitments exceeding its goal. Fund V will adhere to the same investment guidelines as its predecessor, and throwing money at every opportunity that comes along isn’t part of the plan. “We had definitely been disciplined and for very good reasons…so, it would be crazy to lose that discipline and just spend the money,” Bernstein said during Acadia’s second quarter conference call on June 27. “But for those folks who take the point of view, well it’s about assets under management—it’s about AUM, use that money or lose it—I think that’s contrary to our overall philosophy. And what I have found is when people take the approach of use it or lose it, it too often turns into use it and lose it, which doesn’t work for any of us.”
Acting through a subsidiary, Acadia will serve as Fund V’s managing member, and with its own commitment of capital, the REIT has a 20 percent interest in the fund.

San Francisco, California (PRWEB) August 21, 2015 
 HomeLight (http://www.homelight.com), the leader in matching homebuyers and sellers with real estate agents, today announced the release of its 2015 Sacramento Real Estate Top 40 list, highlighting the most accomplished real estate agents in the Sacramento, California metropolitan area.  HomeLight has identified the top performers in five categories: most buyer transactions, most buyer sales volume closed, most listing transactions, most listing sales volume closed, and top sale price to list price ratio.  Agents were selected from a pool of more than 5,000 Sacramento area agents based on their performance during the twelve months ended June 30, 2015.  
HomeLight's matching service helps consumers identify the best real estate agents by analyzing home sales data and evaluating an agent's skills and strengths based on their transaction history.  HomeLight's Real Estate Top 40 leverages this data to distinguish the best Sacramento agents based on unbiased performance metrics.
"HomeLight's proprietary algorithm and transaction data puts us in a unique position to create this original real estate content," said Drew Uher, CEO and Founder of HomeLight.  "Our goal is to help the people of Sacramento reach fantastic outcomes when buying and selling property.  The best way to accomplish that is to direct them to agents who outperform the competition based on objective data." 
Roxanne McCaslin-Curtis, one of HomeLight's Top 40 agents, emphasizes the value that HomeLight provides to both agents and consumers. "HomeLight is making a difference in sellers' and buyers' lives by referring top agents to them.  Everyone who I have assisted is so thankful for HomeLight's introduction to us.  I love being part of your team and servicing amazing clients throughout the area."
The full 2015 Sacramento Real Estate Top 40 list can be found at the link below:

My agents kept saying "Drop the price, drop the price!"Using HomeLight, I quickly found an agent that was a real go-getter. Steve went above and beyond the call of duty. He sold our house higher than the listing price in only eight days.Finding a great agent made all the difference!"Sharon W.Buzzards Bay, MA"In the process of selling my house, finding the right real estate agent was the most important detail. There are many unprofessional real estate agents out there; using HomeLight to find one who was both professional and had a demonstrated history of success was invaluable. I interviewed several agents, but in the end I trusted the actual sales numbers I found on HomeLight. My HomeLight agent has a well-run team and business processes that utilize technology to its fullest: both for marketing my home and keeping me constantly informed. My home was off the market in a week."Elizabeth S.Juptier, FL"Selling our home was a big decision. It was very important to find the right agent who could get me the best price and sell it quickly. I went on the internet and found HomeLight. Filling out the online form just took a few minutes, and it didn't cost anything. I was really glad that HomeLight referred me to Dallas. He just came across as very professional. He sold my house in two and a half weeks, and I got more than I was wanting to get. It was fantastic! I couldn't have been happier."Jim W.Escondido, CA"My husband found HomeLight online. We looked at the different agents, filled out a short form, and the next thing we knew we got a call. I mean, we didn't have to do anything. They did it all. It was really simple and easy.HomeLight connected us to Ruby and we are really happy we used her. Ruby was responsive and she really did her job in terms of marketing the house. We had our first offer in five days, and it closed a month later. If we didn't have a great agent like Ruby, we would probably still have our home on the market.We were thrilled that we found Ruby on HomeLight, and that's the truth."Mara K.Wake Forest, NCWhat You Should Expect Out Of A Great Listing Agent.The top listing agents don’t just post your home for sale online for prospective home buyers to submit bids, they maximize your chances of getting the best price by performing dozens of activities that lead to selling your home. Use this checklist to ensure that your selling agent is doing their job:Analysis of pricing trends and local price per square footAutomatic posting on all major online home search sitesAdvertising in local publicationsPrepping and staging expertiseProfessional photographyCreation of marketing documents (flyers, etc.)Access and monitoring of your private lock-boxDirect mail marketing programDevelopment of virtual tour (bonus)Exclusive previews for other real estate brokersResearch on buyer motivations and capacity24-hour response turnaround time on client requestsAt least 2 open housesIn general, you should expect your real estate agent to be a world class marketer.

Search for the best buyer's agent in your local neighborhood.Top Questions to Ask a Buyer’s AgentWe suggest that you interview at least 2 agents before settling on your final decision. Below are a recommended list of questions to ask any agent before engaging with them:1. What homes have you sold in the neighborhood in the last 3 months?It’s not just important to have an agent with experience in the area you want to buy, but since market conditions change frequently, you should verify that they have recent local experience as well. A knowledgeable agent will have deep comprehension of topics like available schools, health care, desirable streets, and more. 2. Is this your full-time job? Some individuals treat real estate as a side job. Often times they may not be available when you need them or have limited experience. When possible, it is best to select a full-time real estate agent to assist you with your home purchase search. 3. What are your complete real estate credentials?At a minimum, your real estate agent should have active ABR (Accredited Buyer Representatives) and CBR (Certified Buyer Representatives) licenses. Additional certifications or degrees like an MBA, JD, CFA, or CPA are a plus, as they demonstrate competence in dealing with complex transactions. 4. Will they guarantee letting you out of a contract if the relationship isn’t working?In few cases, the buyer and the real estate agent cannot coexist based on personality or philosophical differences. In these rare events, you should feel comfortable that your real estate agent will let you out of your contract immediately and allow you to pursue a relationship with another buyer's agent in the area. 5. What are your fees and how do you get paid?In most cases, real estate agent fees are paid by the seller of the home. You, as the home buyer, will most likely not have to pay anything out of pocket. It is still wise to understand what the buyer's agent’s fees are and how they expect to be paid. This will prevent any potential confusion that may arise once your transaction has successfully been completed. 6. Are you an exclusive buyer's agent?There are generally three types of buyer's agents: non-exclusive, designated, and exclusive. Your best bet typically is to work with an exclusive buyer's agent, as they will be prevented from taking on seller’s listings, therefore reducing any chance for a conflict of interest. 7. Can you give me references I can contact of your last 3-5 home purchases?All good buyer's agents should be more than willing to provide contact information of the last 5 individuals who they assisted in purchasing a home. If an agent hesitates in providing this information, then approach the relationship with caution. Actual Customer Testimonials"Before finding HomeLight, we were lost and had no clue how to find a trustworthy agent. Now we are at ease, and the buying process is simple."Edward G.Santa Monica, CA"My Realtor was great and knew exactly what he was doing. I won't recommend anyone else but him. Many, many thanks HomeLight!"Neha C.San Francisco, CAMore TestimonialsWhat You Should Expect Out Of A Great Buyer's Agent.The top buyer's agents don’t just bring you to homes you could have already found on top home search websites, they maximize your chances of finding the perfect home while staying within your desired budget. Use this checklist to ensure that your buying agent is doing their job:Brings recent knowledge and experience to help you navigate local market characteristicsActs as an evangelist and strategic advisor for you through the home buying processPrepares all required documentation and written offersProvides contacts with high quality home inspectors, title companies and other home services professionalsReviews various financing optionsActively negotiates pricing on behalf of buyerHelps ensure the loan closes successfullyReady to maximize your chance of getting the best prices from ideal buyer's agents?Search for the best buyer's agentFind an agent near you.Search for an AgentFind Top Real Estate Agents in All Major Cities Across the USAtlantaAustinBostonColumbiaDallasDenverFort LauderdaleHoustonLos AngelesMiamiNew YorkPortlandSan DiegoSan FranciscoSarasotaSeattleResourcesFor SellersFor BuyersHome Value EstimatorFor ProfessionalsSign In / Sign UpCity DirectoryAgent DirectoryAgent Help CenterCompanyHow it worksAboutTestimonialsCareersBlogPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceFollow UsFacebookTwitterGoogle+PinterestRSSHomelight has an A+ rating with the Better Business BureauHomeLight For Professionals | Generate More Referrals

HomeLight is amazing to work with. The BEST!!"Carol Lee, Real Estate AgentNewport Beach, CABACKED BYWhat is HomeLight for Real Estate Agents?HomeLight is a great new way for Real Estate Agents to showcase their skills online and generate additional referral business. The world has changed. Consumers now demand more information about the products they buy and the service providers they hire – and this includes agents. HomeLight is a way for consumers to find the right real estate agent for their needs, and it’s a way for agents to objectively demonstrate their ability to add value.How does it work?To get started, click here or use the dropdown above. Create an account and add as much information you can to your profile. When we have clients that are a good match for you, our team will reach out to connect you. Important: If we refer you to a client, it is critical that you call them right away and keep us updated on your progress so that we know they have a good experience. If you have a track record of success in your area, it’s likely we already have your information. However, creating an account will increase the likelihood that we connect you with clients because we’ll know more about you.What does it cost?HomeLight is absolutely free aside from a 25% broker-to-broker referral fee if and when you close business that’s sourced from our platform.Can I pay to boost my HomeLight ranking?Absolutely not. We promise our clients objectivity. Since broker-to-broker fees are standard in the industry, and since virtually all agents are willing to work with us on these terms, we can maintain objectivity to our clients.How can I boost my HomeLight rankings?The short answer: By demonstrating success. Adding content to your profile and encouraging your clients to review you on HomeLight are the best two ways to quickly boost your rankings. Longer term, successfully completing transactions in your target neighborhoods is key.How do I get more reviews?Claim your profile via the dropdown above. Once through the registration process, find the reviews section on the edit profile page. There, you can get a link to send to your clients or enter their email addresses directly in our system.How many leads should I expect?HomeLight is about quality, not quantity. People come to our site specifically because they are looking to work with a top agent. Our team qualifies almost every client that we refer to our agent partners. As a result, you can expect fewer leads through the HomeLight platform vs. Zillow or Trulia, for instance. But the clients we refer are serious, action-oriented buyers and sellers, and these referrals have a very high close rate.Still have more questions?

What can HomeLight do for me?Since 2012, HomeLight has been helping agents promote their reputation online, and now we can do the same for lenders, title companies, general contractors, moving companies, etc. You can create your own HomeLight profile by clicking here or using the dropdown above. This will enable agents to recommend you on our site, which in turn boosts your visibility to their client base and other agents. It’s completely free to create a HomeLight profile to promote your online reputation. Can I pay for advertising to get more business?Yes. Every day we talk to clients who are buying or selling a home, and they will eventually need a mortgage, title company, and home inspector. It’s possible that they will need a general contractor, roofer, or plumber to make repairs. Moreover, we now have a network of thousands of top real estate agents, and many of them are looking for top quality professionals to whom they can refer business. We can help you connect with our agent partners and clients.Specifics about advertising programs depend on your geographic location and the type of service you provide.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
