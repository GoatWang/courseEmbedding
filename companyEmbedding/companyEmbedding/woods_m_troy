Sustainable Hardwood, Sustainable Softwood, Recycle












































 

 


 






SustainabilitySustainability is at the top of nearly everyone’s agenda, and rightfully so. From all corners of government and the corporate world, there is a real and important push towards developing and maintaining responsible business practices.
At Troymill we take this ideal very seriously. Every piece of lumber that we use, both hardwood and softwood, is harvested from a sustainable forest. We understand that sustainability is not only good business practice, but it is the right thing to do.
Moreover, at Troymill, we use every component of the tree, down to the very last fiber. Starting with our hardwood cants, down to the cut stock for our pallets, boxes and crates to the last fibers that make it to sawdust, which is then collected and recycled into boiler fuel. Every wood fiber that comes onto our property serves at least one purpose, if not more.
Additionally, Troymill’s sister company, Manufacturers Wholesale Lumber is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) Certified and is eligible for all FSC designated projects.
All of our lumber has passed through a clear chain of custody. So, as a buyer, you know exactly where your order has come from and can pass the good word on to your customers.

Read entire story >December 6, 2012Quality pallets and industrial wood products in Ohio and a competitive price?How does a company keep the standards of their pallets high, the quality of their pre-cut top notch, and the look and functionality of their specialty products best in class. All while at the same time meeting your customers’ expectations for prompt pallet delivery and competitive wood product price?
Either in the form of a question from one of our pallet customers, or as a request from our pallet sales team throughout Ohio and the Midwest, hardly a day goes by when we’re not thinking about this question. Whether you’re selling pallets in Ohio, pallet pre-cut in Pennsylvania or wooden boxes and crates in Cleveland, the challenges of the hardwood lumber and pallet market are many.
The answer to the question is attention to details. It’s easy to get lost in the rush to expand sales and grow your business, but it’s important to not lose sight of the small stuff.
In more practical terms, it means the following:

Keeping a sufficient hardwood lumber supply (one of the largest in the Midwest actually) as well as the right amount of Pine, Pallet Precuts, OSB and Plywood
Make sure to “turn” your lumber and utilize your hardwood and pine inventory properly. Lumber is perishable, making intelligent inventory management essential
Understand the usage and seasonality of your customers hardwood pallet needs so that you have neither too little nor too much lumber ready for them
Continually stress the importance of quality standards both of your finished pallets and wood products as well as your raw inventory
Train your workforce understand that while it just may be a pallet or wooden crate
to them, it’s likely much more than that to the end user.

Executive ManagementAt TSYS®, servant leadership is a driving force behind who we are and what we do. It means we are here to serve — our clients, our shareholders and each other — and together shape a vision everyone can own.







 M. Troy WoodsChairman of the Board & Chief Executive Officer, TSYS



Download

Troy Woods, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of TSYS, has guided the company's diversification strategy into faster-growing areas of payments as TSYS moved beyond its roots as a third-party processor for a few hundred bank issuers and merchant acquirers. This included the company's entry into the direct merchant acquiring business serving hundreds of thousands of businesses and into a leading prepaid services provider, supporting millions of underserved consumers who do not have access to traditional financial services.
Woods has been the catalyst in TSYS' vision to be the leading global payments solutions provider by driving innovation to improve lives and businesses across the world by putting people at the center of payments. Under Woods leadership, the company introduced its brand promise, People-Centered Payments, which is based on the belief that payments should revolve around people, not the other way around.
Woods started his career at Columbus Bank and Trust Company (Columbus, Ga.) in 1970, working part-time in the bankcard department and eventually becoming a vice president. He left the company in 1977 to become a senior vice president for card services with United American Bank, Knoxville, TN. In 1979 he joined AmSouth Bank in Birmingham, AL, as senior vice president of Card Services, and in 1982 became senior vice president of Consumer Lending. He rejoined TSYS in 1987 and was involved in directing the company's international expansion, strategic planning activities, negotiations with major clients, and the continual improvement of TS2, the company's core issuing payments engine.
Woods is chairman of the TSYS Board of Directors, and also serves on the Board of Directors for several civic organizations as well, including the YMCA of Metropolitan Columbus (Ga.), West Georgia Honor Flight and the Greater Columbus Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees for Columbus State University and the River Center for the Performing Arts in Columbus, Georgia.
Woods earned a bachelor's degree from Columbus State University (Columbus, Ga.). He also graduated from the University of Virginia's Graduate School of Retail Bank Management; Louisiana State University's School of Banking of the South; and University of Pennsylvania’s CEO Academy at The Wharton School.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

M. Troy Woods





 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  
 TSYS   

 
 
Tweet 












Troy Woods, chairman, president and chief executive officer of TSYS, has guided the company's diversification strategy into faster-growing areas of payments as TSYS moved beyond its roots as a third-party processor for a few hundred bank issuers and merchant acquirers. This included the company's entry into the direct merchant acquiring business serving hundreds of thousands of businesses and into a leading prepaid services provider, supporting millions of underserved consumers who do not have access to traditional financial services.
Woods has been the catalyst in TSYS' vision to be the leading global payments solutions provider by driving innovation to improve lives and businesses across the world by putting people at the center of payments. Under Woods leadership, the company introduced its brand promise, People-Centered Payments, which is based on the belief that payments should revolve around people, not the other way around.
Woods started his career at Columbus Bank and Trust Company (Columbus, Ga.) in 1970, working part-time in the bankcard department and eventually becoming a vice president. He left the company in 1977 to become a senior vice president for card services with United American Bank, Knoxville, TN. In 1979 he joined AmSouth Bank in Birmingham, AL, as senior vice president of Card Services, and in 1982 became senior vice president of Consumer Lending. He rejoined TSYS in 1987 and was involved in directing the company's international expansion, strategic planning activities, negotiations with major clients, and the continual improvement of TS2, the company's core issuing payments engine.
Woods is chairman of the TSYS Board of Directors, and also serves on the Board of Directors  for several civic organizations as well, including the YMCA of Metropolitan Columbus (Ga.), West Georgia Honor Flight and the Greater Columbus Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees for Columbus State University and the River Center for the Performing Arts in Columbus, Georgia.Woods earned a bachelor's degree from Columbus State University (Columbus, Ga.), and also graduated from the University of Virginia's Graduate School of Retail Bank Management and Louisiana State University's School of Banking of the South.
