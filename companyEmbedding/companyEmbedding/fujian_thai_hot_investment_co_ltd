NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alliance HealthCare Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: AIQ) (the “Company”, 
      “Alliance”, “we” or “our”), a leading national provider of outsourced 
      radiology, oncology and interventional services, announced today that 
      the Company entered into a Governance, Voting and Standstill Agreement 
      (the “Governance Agreement”) with Fujian Thai Hot Investment Co., Ltd 
      (“Fujian Thai Hot”) with respect to the acquisition by Fujian Thai Hot 
      of 5,537,945 shares of common stock of the Company from funds managed by 
      Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. and MTS Health Investors, LLC, and 
      Larry C. Buckelew (together, the “Selling Stockholders”) (the 
      “Transaction”). Fujian Thai Hot now owns an aggregate of approximately 
      51.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The Company did 
      not sell any shares in the Transaction.
    


      Tom Tomlinson, Chief Executive Officer and President of Alliance, 
      commented, “We are thrilled to welcome our new partner, Fujian Thai Hot, 
      and look forward to collaborating with our new Board Chairman Qisen 
      Huang as well as Mr. Feng and Dr. Zhang as new Board members. Supported 
      by leadership from Fujian Thai Hot, our team remains focused on 
      executing against our long-term strategic growth plan, improving the 
      long-term profitability of our business and enhancing the value 
      proposition we provide to our customers. Additionally, Fujian Thai Hot’s 
      international experience will help Alliance evaluate global 
      opportunities as we look to expand our footprint, including capitalizing 
      on opportunities in China and other global markets that have an unmet 
      need for quality healthcare services.”
    

      Qisen Huang, Founder and Chairman of Fujian Thai Hot, and as of today, 
      Chairman of the Alliance HealthCare Services Board of Directors (the 
      “Board”), said, “The synergies between our two companies will support 
      strategic growth of Alliance in the decades to come, while at the same 
      time, provide Chinese patients with access to the American standard of 
      healthcare. As we work toward achieving this goal together, we all are 
      contributing to a greater good.”
    

      The Chairman continued, “I respect the great accomplishments that 
      Alliance has made over the past decades which include being a market 
      leader in medical imaging and radiation oncology, as well as 
      accelerating growth in the fragmented pain management sector. I expect 
      the Alliance leadership team to continue executing on its long-term 
      strategies while sharing best practices with the Chinese market. 
      Together, I trust that Fujian Thai Hot and Alliance can make a great 
      difference and change the way healthcare is delivered in China, while 
      continuing strong growth and innovation in the United States.”
    

Governance Agreement


      The Governance Agreement with Fujian Thai Hot is effective as of the 
      closing of the Transaction. The Governance Agreement and other matters 
      related to the Transaction were approved by a Special Committee of the 
      Board composed of independent directors of the Company not affiliated 
      with any Selling Stockholder.
    

      The Governance Agreement provides, in part, that Fujian Thai Hot and its 
      affiliates are prohibited, for a period of three years from the date of 
      the closing of the Transaction, from acquiring additional shares of the 
      Company’s common stock without the prior consent of a majority of the 
      unaffiliated directors, provided that, if Fujian Thai Hot’s beneficial 
      ownership falls below 51.5% of the outstanding common stock, Fujian Thai 
      Hot has the right to acquire additional shares to maintain its 
      beneficial ownership at up to 51.5% if such right is exercised within 
      120 days of Fujian Thai Hot’s beneficial ownership level falling below 
      such level.
    

Board Appointees


      Qisen Huang, Heping Feng and Tao Zhang were appointed to the Board. The 
      new directors replaced Michael Harmon, Curtis Lane and Aaron Bendikson 
      who resigned from the Board effective as of the closing of the 
      Transaction. Mr. Feng and Mr. Zhang have each been appointed to serve on 
      the Compensation and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees 
      of the Board.
    

Credit Amendment


      In connection with the closing of the Transaction, the Company also 
      entered into an Amendment to the Company’s Credit Agreement (the “Credit 
      Amendment”). Under the Credit Amendment, the Company’s Credit Agreement 
      was amended such that the sale of shares of Alliance by the Selling 
      Stockholders to Fujian Thai Hot would not be deemed to constitute a 
      change of control and the soft call provision was reinstated to commence 
      on the date the Credit Amendment is effective and end the date that is 
      twelve (12) months after such commencement.

                Alliance HealthCare            






Chinese investment holding company Fujian Thai Hot Investment Co. Ltd has agreed to buy a majority stake in Alliance HealthCare Services Inc. for about $102.5 million.
Under the agreement, Thai Hot will buy about 5.5 million shares of Alliance HealthCare’s common stock from funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management L.P., MTS Health Investors LLC and Larry C. Buckelew for about $18.50 per share.

Alliance HealthCare






 


Once the deal closes, Thai Hot would own 51.5 percent of the outstanding common stock of the Newport Beach-based Alliance HealthCare(Nasdaq: AIQ), a provider of outsourced healthcare services. Alliance is not selling any shares in the transaction.
Shares of Alliance Healthcare fell 24 percent to $12.86 a share late Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq market.
Alliance Chief Executive and President Tom Tomlinson said the deal is expected to “strengthen Alliance’s competitive position and long-term value proposition.”
“We look forward to welcoming our new business partner and its breadth of international experience as we look ahead to the next phase of growth for Alliance,” Tomlinson said in a statement. “We are excited by the compelling opportunities that lie ahead with our oncology, radiology and interventional services platforms. We are confident this new partnership will help the company deliver long-term growth, both in the U.S. and in China.”
Thai Hot founder and Chairman Kisum Wong said his company’s investment in Alliance “represents an excellent long-term strategic fit for our portfolio of diversified businesses.”
“We look forward to working closely with the board and the management team to execute its multi-faceted growth strategy,” Wong said. “Alliance will continue to focus on its growth opportunities in the U.S., as well as explore international market prospects in China, which can provide significant growth opportunity as the company strives to fulfill China’s unmet demand for quality healthcare services and products.”




 


Alliance’s board authorized a special committee, comprised of directors not affiliated with any selling stockholders, to review the transaction. The committee hired independent legal counsel.
Under the deal, Thai Hot’s Wong, Yong Ge and Tao Zhang will be named to the board to replace Michael P. Harmon, Curtis S. Lane and Aaron A. Bendikson who will resign as director. Wong will become chairman, while current Chairman Larry C. Buckelew will continue as a director.

In addition, Thai Hot will be prohibited for a three-year period from increasing its beneficial ownership beyond 51.5 percent without the approval of independent directors.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to certain closing conditions.
Alliance operates 518 diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy systems, including 118 fixed-site imaging centers across the country; and 32 radiation therapy centers and stereotactic radiosurgery facilities. It provides clinical services for roughly 1,000 hospitals and other healthcare partners in 44 states and employs about 1,800 workers.
Thai Hot, based in Fuzhou, China, holds assets in various industries including real estate development, securities, hospitality, biomedicine and healthcare. Founded in 1996, its total assets exceeded $10 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014. In early 2015, Thai Hot made healthcare and medical services one of its top priorities, including radiology and oncology, and said it plans to expand healthcare services in mainland China to an underserved healthcare marketplace.
