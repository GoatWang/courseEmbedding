The columns are dated to show their original publication dates, and the material is organized into four broad themes:HIT Applications and Analytics Challenges Improving Organizational Performance through HIT IT Management Challenges HIT Industry ObservationsEach section offers readers an intimate look at the myriad issues associated with getting IT &quot;right&quot; and the organizational performance gains that can be achieved in doing so. Moreover, the book examines the power and potential of the technologies available to health care providers today, as well as the transformative nature of those we have yet to fully embrace.From seasoned CIOs and consultants to software developers and nurses, this book provides invaluable insights and guidance to all those seeking to make the delivery of care safer, more effective, and more efficient through the application of health care IT.Foreword by Russ Branzell, President and CEO, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME)

Summary
John Glaser has been an astute observer and recognized leader in the health care industry for over thirty years. He has written a regular column for Hospitals & Health Networks in which he comments on a wide range of topics, including improving organizational performance through health information technology (HIT), changes in HIT architecture, challenges in leveraging data, and the evolution of the role of IT leadership. Glaser on Health Care IT: Perspectives from the Decade that Defined Health Care Information Technology is a collection of some of the most widely read articles that have been published in H&HN Daily, H&HN Weekly, and Most Wired Online in the past decade (2005–2015). The columns are dated to show their original publication dates, and the material is organized into four broad themes: 


HIT Applications and Analytics Challenges
Improving Organizational Performance through HIT
IT Management Challenges
HIT Industry Observations

Each section offers readers an intimate look at the myriad issues associated with getting IT "right" and the organizational performance gains that can be achieved in doing so.

Reviews
"This book is a collection of John’s finest and most challenging work. These writings represent over a decade of self- and industry introspection and critique. Some will explore the current challenges and potential solutions we face during these transitional years; some will dissect the current policy, exploring weaknesses and errors; but all will educate and inform in a witty and thought-provoking style. Today’s challenges, just like those of the past several decades, require shared learning and understanding. These writings represent an amazing opportunity to learn and understand from one of the best. He not only helped to start us on this journey but also blazed a path of discovery and innovation."—From the Foreword by Russ Branzell, President and CEO, College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME)
