International investing involves special risks including currency risk, increased volatility, political risks, and differences in auditing and other financial standards.   There are no guarantees that dividend-paying stocks will continue to pay dividends. In addition, dividend-paying stocks may not experience the same capital appreciation potential as non-dividend-paying stocks.   Because the fund may allocate relatively more assets to certain industry sectors than others, the fund's performance may be more susceptible to any developments which affect those sectors emphasized by the fund.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.   These pages include general information and have not been tailored for any specific recipient or recipients.
