About this Webinar:
As they strive to become more data-driven, many organizations discover that they actually lack real-time insight into customer needs and behavior. At the same time, the data-savvy employees of these companies find they can’t easily access data and analytical insight when they need it most.
The fact of the matter is, traditional on-premise business intelligence (BI) platforms, although effective at creating static views of historical information, fall far short when it comes to flexibility and speed. As a result, companies today increasingly seek alternative and hybrid approaches to analytics, approaches that can provide their staff with the tools needed to do their jobs and serve a new generation of customers.
In this webinar, Aberdeen Group VP and Principal Analyst, Michael Lock, will discuss findings from his latest research into the current state of business intelligence (BI) and analytics. You will learn:
What business pressures drive the need for new approaches to BI
Key practices that empower the analytical workforce (e.g. cloud/hybrid infrastructure and mobile intelligence)
Top strategies for understanding and meeting the needs of today’s customers (e.g. location-based intelligence, predictive analytics)

Cement production companies often times must acquire proper permits as required by the Clean Air Act.

Media Analytics Corp.: This E-Mail Promoted Stock May Leave Investors In The Dust - Media Analytics Corp (OTCMKTS:MEDA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Media Analytics Corp.: This E-Mail Promoted Stock May Leave Investors In The DustDec.10.14 | About: Media Analytics (MEDA) Investor Protection Association Short onlySummaryWe have received numerous e-mails touting MEDA from various stock promoters.The timing of the emails promoting MEDA coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in price and trading volume of the stock.The recent financials of the company appear to be very bleak due to zero revenue and negative income.Shares of the company have been issued for next to nothing and are ready to be dumped into the market.We have contacted the company via e-mail and are waiting for a response regarding the claims in the article.Note: This article is about a nano-cap stock (also referred to as a "penny stock"). While all investments are risky, nano-cap stocks are among the most risky. Among nano-cap stocks, the most risky stocks are those, which are subject to promotional campaigns (such as MEDA). They are also among the most illiquid stocks, usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment. Quite often, it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position. MEDA is no exception to that. MEDA is a nano-cap stock which is traded on the OTC Markets and priced well below the 1$ mark. The readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article.
Introduction
Media Analytics Corp. (OTCPK:MEDA) is a company trading at a price that has recently run from a low of $0.02 to a high of $0.066 during a single trading session. In this article, we will outline the facts, which are, in our opinion, related to the sudden increase in the price and trading volume of this usually thinly traded, low volume stock.
The Promotion
Let us analyze the recent price action and trade volume of MEDA:
The trading volume and price of MEDA have both literally exploded on December 8, the date when the first promotional email was received. It is quite obvious that the email being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and price of the stock are interconnected events.

Emails received on MEDA:

MEDA Chart:

(Editor's Note: MEDA closed trading Wednesday up $0.02, or 27.06%, to close at $0.11.)
The Reality: Zero Revenue, Negative Income, Bright Future?
As often happens with aggressively promoted companies, a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture. It seems Media Analytics Corp. is no exception to that rule.
In our opinion, it is clear that the price of MEDA has nothing in common with the stock's true value. If we were to take a look at MEDA's income statement, we would see that the company's revenue has remained exactly zero while the company's income has been negative during the entire year of 2014:

Moreover, if we were to take a look at the latest 10-Q form filed on 11/14/2014, we would see that shares of the company have previously been issued at next-to-nothing prices ($0.001) to insiders of the company:


With all these factors taken into account, it should come as no surprise that according to the same 10-Q form filed on 11/14/2014, the company is actually classified as a going concern and has accrued net losses since inception (with all the attendant circumstances):

It is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that MEDA's current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at over-inflated prices, rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market. But why, you ask?
The Reason
Why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised? That is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock. The answer for this hides, of course, in the small print. Let us have a look at the disclaimer found in the promotional emails touting MEDA, which we've received:

Or:

Or:


In simple, plain English: someone - maybe the promoter sending out the email message or a third party who might have paid the promoter in cash for sending the message - is holding shares of MEDA and plans to get rid of them ("dump" them) in the open market. Therefore, our conclusion is that the promotional email's sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices, while the promoters (or third party) unload their shares upon them.
Conclusion
It is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article we hold the opinion that MEDA shares are essentially worthless. We believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock. This practice is well known (see Pump and Dump) and is done exclusively for one reason only - so the insiders can unload ("dump") their shares (which they had previously acquired for almost free) in the free market onto unsuspecting investors, while taking advantage of the stock's inflated price. In view of that, we hold the opinion that any investor who had purchased shares of the company should consider liquidating his entire position immediately. Even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing.
Our View
"He that lives upon hope will die fasting" - Benjamin Franklin
For longs: If you are long the stock, we believe you should consider getting out immediately. It is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stock's price is likely to be temporary, as it will never repeat its previous highs. We believe MEDA has a price target of around $0.001, which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks (or months at most).
If you have already accrued losses on the stock, it may be a good idea to sell now so as to avoid additional losses. Do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs. Do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many. We believe MEDA's stock price will drop 90% or more in the following weeks. It may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now.

"Profit is sweet, even if it comes from deception" - Sophocles
For shorts: Bearing the aforementioned facts in mind, we believe sophisticated investors will quickly comprehend the idea that shorting MEDA may be a lucrative opportunity, as we are convinced that the potential downside for MEDA is substantial. If you are able to locate borrows, we believe shorting MEDA may prove to be profitable, as its price may prove to be highly inflated.

Analytics "THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS" 





Analytics

				Use analytics to lead your successful digital transformation.
            





					Data analytics extracts insights  from large amounts of data and turns it into value.
					We at Hitachi can help you move through the digital  transformation of your business.
				





                        Digital transformation is essential for companies to continually enhance their corporate value. This shift combines analysis and simulation, reflecting real world scenarios in a digital context. The process dramatically accelerates the actualization of business ideas and is the foundation of continuous improvement.
                    

                        Data analytics create new value by extracting insights  from large amounts of data. Repeating these analytics in short cycles allows you to further accelerate the speed of your improvements and gain new abilities, ultimately leading to significant innovations.
                    

                        At Hitachi, we support digital transformation through long-term co-creation with our clients. It’s part of our commitment to you to solve your business problems and create new value.
                    





                    Our analytics are already accelerating the digital transformation of clients in many business fields.
                

                	Engineering work and expertise can now be automated and passed on to others through digitization and data analytics.
				





                        Engineering expertise plays a vital role in optimizing manufacturing work and formulating production plans. But because it is highly specialized, this knowledge has always been difficult to define and apply to wider, more efficient uses. Now, through the continuous analysis made possible by Hitachi analytics, your company is able to automate and digitize this expertise to use it in more areas of your business. For example, we helped a manufacturing company digitally reproduce 86%  of the work involved in formulating production plans that was previously done by proficient  engineers. As a result, they were able to raise quality and shorten development cycles in more areas of their business.   It’s just one of the many challenges Hitachi has taken on as we continue to find new opportunities in automation.
                    





                	Facilities and equipment serve as the foundation of many industries. You can implement effective prevention and maintenance measures by discovering early signs of failure through an analysis of operational data.
				





                        All businesses rely on the efficiency of their facilities and equipment. In order to operate at the highest efficiency, organizations must minimize the downtime caused by malfunctions and other factors. With analytics, we’re able to proactively predict failures by collecting and analyzing the data from these operational technologies. By implementing prevention and maintenance measures before mishaps occur, we can help make the best operational use of facilities, equipment and even whole businesses.
                    





					Damages from increasing numbers of security breaches can be minimized by time series analysis of a wide variety of data.
                





                        According to the report, Global State of Information Security , worldwide security incidents increased 38% in 2015 compared to the previous year. These breaches result in an astounding economic loss of hundreds of billion dollars per year. To help protect you from these catastrophic damages, our first step is to determine the causes of security threats. We do this with time series analysis through a comprehensive process that merges a variety of data from many different sources of information.
                    





                   Hitachi’s analytics are supported by diverse technologies and physical support
                

					Our Data Analytics Meister Service helps customers create innovation through a group of experts who possess both business knowledge and data analysis intelligence.
                

                    Big data is big business. Hitachi helps you use big data to grow in the new digital economy by starting with a deeper understanding of advanced analysis products and information and communications technology (ICT) products. But we don’t stop there. In addition to this innovative analytics approach, Hitachi also provides consulting through our Data Analytics Meister Service.
					Our Data Analytics Meister—a specialist in big data utilization—gives you a full walkthrough of the analytics process from start to finish. 
					This comprehensive service advances through four phases:
				

                   (1) Design a vision and set a goal.
				   (2) Formulate a utilization scenario, in which a scenario for realizing the vision is developed—clarifying the value that will be created.
				   (3) Verify the practical use in which the data analysis method is established and its efficacy is verified.
				   (4) Implement the system, to apply the final execution. Our team works closely with you to help you through every stage of the analytics process.




					Pentaho is an analytics solution that integrates operational data and big data, enabling you to analyze your business from all angles.
                

					Pentaho analytics integrates a wide variety of data—from internal and external data to the vast amount of data collected through the internet of things (IoT)—and makes it available on demand for analysis. This solution aggregates all of the data into a “data lake,” and quickly provides a simple-format summary. It also offers a 360 degree analysis that helps users in different parts of your organization to quickly make the best possible decisions from accurate information.
				




					“Hitachi AI Technology” investigates large volumes of data to uncover effective hypotheses.
                

					Through years of research, Hitachi has developed an artificial intelligence technology that is creating real value for our customers. By conducting analysis beyond the limits of human capabilities, Hitachi AI Technology helps you uncover hypotheses and unimaginable solutions.
