Ericson and Jerry Harvey at the George Washington University.[1]

Work[edit]
Strategic Management System[edit]
To develop a strategic management system, Haines (2000) suggested using the "Systems Thinking Approach" and its five-phased (ABCDE) Systems Thinking model that invites the leader to ask and answer five important questions:[4][5]

(A) Where do we want to be?
(B) How will we know when we get there?
(C) Where are we right now?
(D) How do we get there from here?, and
(E) What is changing in the future external environment, that we need to take into account?

These five questions "align directly with the five phases of a system: (1) output, (2) feedback loop, (3) input, and (4) throughput/actions (5) within the dynamic and changing environment".[5]

Work[edit]
Strategic Management System[edit]
To develop a strategic management system, Haines (2000) suggested using the "Systems Thinking Approach" and its five-phased (ABCDE) Systems Thinking model that invites the leader to ask and answer five important questions:[4][5]

(A) Where do we want to be?
(B) How will we know when we get there?
(C) Where are we right now?
(D) How do we get there from here?, and
(E) What is changing in the future external environment, that we need to take into account?

These five questions "align directly with the five phases of a system: (1) output, (2) feedback loop, (3) input, and (4) throughput/actions (5) within the dynamic and changing environment".[5]
Publications[edit]
Haines wrote more than 16 books, over 50 articles, and developed 12 volumes of the Haines' Strategic Library.[6] A selection:
