History[edit]
Founded in 1958 by predecessor, Martin H. Smith Co, and then incorporated as Cooper Tinsley Laboratories, Inc. in 1961, the company changed its name to Cooper Laboratories Inc. in 1967.[4] In 1979 Cooper Laboratories introduced their first soft contact lens in the United States. During a re-structuring in the 1980s, Cooper Laboratories was re-organised into three groups, CooperVision, CooperCare and CooperBiomedical, with a further group, Cooper Medical Devices Corp, added a year later. In 1987 the company adopted the name of Cooper Companies, with CooperVision existing as a subsidiary.[5] By the 1990s, through various acquisitions and expansions, the company had expanded into other areas of healthcare, including, among others, medical devices and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.
The President and Chief Executive Officer & Director is Robert S. Weiss'.
Shareholders[edit]
Mutual fund holders 62.21% Other institutional 34.90% Individual stakeholders 1.13%[6]
Recalls[edit]
2011 – Contact lenses from the Avaira line were recalled following an investigation by the United States Food and Drug Administration into claims that the level of silicone oil residue on the contact lenses could cause blurred vision and discomfort.[7]
Litigation[edit]
In 2012 Cooper Companies, Inc settled $27.0 million on a claim brought by a group of stockholders after claims that Cooper Companies misled them about the problems they were facing with contact lenses produced overseas, contact lenses that were subsequently recalled.[8]
In 1988, Cooper Companies was involved in a case brought against them by Medical Engineering Corp, part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, after they claimed that Cooper Companies had agreed to assume responsibility for breast implants that were manufactured while they still owned the business.[9] This was one of many lawsuits related to breast implants and the issue was resolved in 1993 when Medical Engineering agreed to pay all legal costs relating to breast implants, both in the future and still in dispute.

History[edit]
Founded in 1958 by predecessor, Martin H. Smith Co, and then incorporated as Cooper Tinsley Laboratories, Inc. in 1961, the company changed its name to Cooper Laboratories Inc. in 1967.[4] In 1979 Cooper Laboratories introduced their first soft contact lens in the United States. During a re-structuring in the 1980s, Cooper Laboratories was re-organised into three groups, CooperVision, CooperCare and CooperBiomedical, with a further group, Cooper Medical Devices Corp, added a year later. In 1987 the company adopted the name of Cooper Companies, with CooperVision existing as a subsidiary.[5] By the 1990s, through various acquisitions and expansions, the company had expanded into other areas of healthcare, including, among others, medical devices and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.
The President and Chief Executive Officer & Director is Robert S. Weiss'.
Shareholders[edit]
Mutual fund holders 62.21% Other institutional 34.90% Individual stakeholders 1.13%[6]
Recalls[edit]
2011 – Contact lenses from the Avaira line were recalled following an investigation by the United States Food and Drug Administration into claims that the level of silicone oil residue on the contact lenses could cause blurred vision and discomfort.[7]
Litigation[edit]
In 2012 Cooper Companies, Inc settled $27.0 million on a claim brought by a group of stockholders after claims that Cooper Companies misled them about the problems they were facing with contact lenses produced overseas, contact lenses that were subsequently recalled.[8]
In 1988, Cooper Companies was involved in a case brought against them by Medical Engineering Corp, part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, after they claimed that Cooper Companies had agreed to assume responsibility for breast implants that were manufactured while they still owned the business.[9] This was one of many lawsuits related to breast implants and the issue was resolved in 1993 when Medical Engineering agreed to pay all legal costs relating to breast implants, both in the future and still in dispute.

History[edit]
Founded in 1958 by predecessor, Martin H. Smith Co, and then incorporated as Cooper Tinsley Laboratories, Inc. in 1961, the company changed its name to Cooper Laboratories Inc. in 1967.[4] In 1979 Cooper Laboratories introduced their first soft contact lens in the United States. During a re-structuring in the 1980s, Cooper Laboratories was re-organised into three groups, CooperVision, CooperCare and CooperBiomedical, with a further group, Cooper Medical Devices Corp, added a year later. In 1987 the company adopted the name of Cooper Companies, with CooperVision existing as a subsidiary.[5] By the 1990s, through various acquisitions and expansions, the company had expanded into other areas of healthcare, including, among others, medical devices and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals.
The President and Chief Executive Officer & Director is Robert S. Weiss'.
Shareholders[edit]
Mutual fund holders 62.21% Other institutional 34.90% Individual stakeholders 1.13%[6]
Recalls[edit]
2011 – Contact lenses from the Avaira line were recalled following an investigation by the United States Food and Drug Administration into claims that the level of silicone oil residue on the contact lenses could cause blurred vision and discomfort.[7]
Litigation[edit]
In 2012 Cooper Companies, Inc settled $27.0 million on a claim brought by a group of stockholders after claims that Cooper Companies misled them about the problems they were facing with contact lenses produced overseas, contact lenses that were subsequently recalled.[8]
In 1988, Cooper Companies was involved in a case brought against them by Medical Engineering Corp, part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, after they claimed that Cooper Companies had agreed to assume responsibility for breast implants that were manufactured while they still owned the business.[9] This was one of many lawsuits related to breast implants and the issue was resolved in 1993 when Medical Engineering agreed to pay all legal costs relating to breast implants, both in the future and still in dispute.

The Cooper Companies Announces First Quarter 2016 Results

PLEASANTON, Calif., March  03, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE:COO) today announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended January 31, 2016.
First quarter revenue increased 1% year-over-year to $449.6 million.  First quarter GAAP earnings per share (EPS) $1.05, down 20 cents or 16% from last year's first quarter. First quarter non-GAAP EPS $1.83, up 8 cents or 5% from last year's first quarter.  See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results to GAAP Results" below.First quarter free cash flow $44.4 million and adjusted free cash flow $56.7 million. Commenting on the results, Robert S. Weiss, Cooper's president and chief executive officer said, "I am pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year. CooperVision continued to gain market share driven by growth in Biofinity® and its 1-Day silicone hydrogel 
products. CooperSurgical made a lot of progress and posted strong results. We are increasing our guidance for the year to reflect our first quarter performance and the impact of improving currency on earnings, and we remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business." First Quarter GAAP Operating Highlights Revenue $449.6 million, up 1% from last year's first quarter, up 5% pro forma (defined as constant currency and including acquisitions in both periods).Gross margin 58% compared with 62% in last year's first quarter.  Gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by currency and product mix. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 61% vs. 64% last year.Operating margin 13% compared with 16% in last 
year's first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 22% vs. 23% last year.Depreciation $37.3 million, up 27% from last year's first quarter due primarily to $6.1 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition.  Amortization $16.2 million, up 19% from last year's first quarter on acquisitions.Total debt increased $28.1 million from October 31, 2015, to $1,377.3 million, primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow generation. Interest expense increased to $5.3 million compared with $3.9 million in last year's first quarter primarily due to higher debt and interest rates associated with acquisitions.Cash provided by operations 
$89.5 million and capital expenditures $45.1 million resulted in free cash flow of $44.4 million.  Excluding integration costs of $12.3 million, adjusted free cash flow was $56.7 million.

otherwise incurred as part of our continuing operations.  Details are summarized as follows: Total revenue of $1,865 - $1,905 million CVI revenue $1,510 - $1,540 millionCSI revenue $355 - $365 million Non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.00 - $8.30  Other On March 1, 2016, closed $1.83 billion in new 5-year senior unsecured credit facilities (replacement of $1.0 billion revolving line of credit and new $830.0 million term loan).  The proceeds of the term loan were used to repay certain existing indebtedness and will also be used to reduce the $700.0 million term loan due 
August 2017 and for general corporate purposes. Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP ResultsTo supplement our financial results and guidance presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures that we believe are helpful in understanding our results. The non-GAAP measures exclude costs which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations.  These include costs related to acquisitions and integration activities, severance and restructuring costs; costs associated with the start-up of new manufacturing facilities; as well as certain legal costs described below.  Our non-GAAP financial results and guidance are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Management uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions.  These non-GAAP measures are among the factors management uses in planning and forecasting for future periods.  We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our consolidated operating results.  Our non-GAAP financial measures include the following adjustments, along with the related income tax effects and changes in income attributable to noncontrolling interests: We exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial results.  Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods; however, the amounts are affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions.We exclude the effect of 
acquisition related and integration expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP financial results.  Such expenses generally diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions; however, we generally will incur similar expenses in connection with any future acquisitions. We incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Many of these costs relate to our acquisition of Sauflon Pharmaceuticals Ltd. that closed in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2014.  Acquisition related and integration expenses include items such as personnel costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs and integration 
related professional services.  Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance, product rationalization, facility and other exit costs.We exclude costs associated with the start-up of new manufacturing facilities.  While these costs may recur for a period of time, we do not consider them as part of our continuing operations. These costs will be eliminated when the specific start-up activities have been completed.We exclude certain legal costs related to third-party intellectual property claims and litigation filed against CooperVision and other contact lens manufacturers relating to Unilateral Pricing Policy (UPP) as well as related lobbying costs.  While we may incur similar costs and charges, we do not consider them as part of our continuing operations. Guidance for earnings per share is provided on a non-GAAP basis due to 
the inherent difficulty in forecasting acquisition-related, integration and restructuring charges and expenses.  We are not able to provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP items to expected reported GAAP earnings per share due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of such charges and expenses.  Management does not consider the excluded items as part of our continuing operations. We also report revenue growth using the non-GAAP financial measure of pro forma which includes constant currency revenue. Management presents and refers to constant currency information so that revenue results may be evaluated excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current period revenue for entities reporting in currencies other than the United States dollar are converted into 
United States dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year. To report pro forma revenue growth, we include revenue for the comparison period when we did not own recently acquired companies. We define the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.  We believe free cash flow is useful for investors as an additional measure of liquidity because it represents cash flows that are available for repayment of debt, repurchases of our common stock or to fund our strategic initiatives.   Management uses free cash flow internally to understand, manage, make operating decisions and evaluate our business.  In addition, we use free cash flow to help plan and forecast future periods. We also provide the metric of adjusted free 
cash flow that we believe represents our operations ability to generate cash by adjusting cash flow from operations for capital expenditures that are part of our ongoing operations and for acquisition related and integration costs.  We believe adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors as an additional measure of performance because it reports elements of our operating activities and excludes cash flow elements that we do not consider to be related to our ability to generate cash.  As discussed above, we incur significant acquisition related and integration costs that will diminish over time; and we believe it is useful to investors to understand the effects of these costs on our adjusted free cash flow.  THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.

Copper is a precious metal not unlike silver and gold. It’s the most versatile metal in existence. It’s used everywhere and has been a part of humankind's development for thousands of years.
It has such a high commercial and industrial importance that you’ll never see its price fall to zero.
The World Bank (WB) projects that copper prices will start rising to reach $5,400 in 2017; $5,509 in 2018; $5,620 in 2019; and up to $7,000 by 2030.
We’re starting to rely on alternative ways to provide a cleaner world, and copper will play a huge role in the advancement of technology and our society.
Automakers will need at least three times more copper than ever before to supply the increasing consumer demand for electric vehicles.
Copper’s demand is high, and it’s increasing every day.
For those of you who don’t want to miss this opportunity, we're offering our latest, limited-time-only report “Copper Outlook 2017: Copper Gears Up for a Stronger Year” free of charge.
Inside you'll find:

Copper’s outlook for 2017.
Three copper stocks to consider for 2017.
Key indicators to look out for when investing in copper.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
