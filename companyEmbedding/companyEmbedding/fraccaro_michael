PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MasterCard today announced the appointment of Michael Fraccaro as chief 
      human resources officer, succeeding Ron Garrow who decided to move with 
      his family back to North Carolina after six years with the company. 
      Fraccaro’s appointment is effective July 8, 2016.
    


      Garrow joined MasterCard in March 2010 as senior vice president of 
      global talent acquisition management and development, following 25 years 
      in HR roles at Bank of America and Wachovia. In 2011, he was promoted to 
      executive vice president of global human resources plans and programs 
      and in 2013 he became chief human resources officer.
    

      “Ron has made a significant impact on our organization over the past six 
      years,” said Ajay Banga, president and chief executive officer, 
      MasterCard. “His passion for our people and our organization has 
      transformed our culture and established our company as a great place to 
      work. On behalf of the entire organization, I’d like to wish Ron and his 
      family the very best going forward.”
    

      Fraccaro joined MasterCard in 2012 as executive vice president of human 
      resources for the company’s Global Products and Solutions (GP&S) 
      business. In this role, he supported the company’s growth in key 
      businesses and markets and optimized talent programs in a competitive 
      environment. He was also responsible for leading the global HR 
      integration of new acquisitions and joint ventures.
    

      “Michael’s global experience in leading significant change programs will 
      help MasterCard as we continue to grow and build our business around the 
      world,” said Banga. “He has been working very closely with Ron and we 
      look forward to his continued leadership as we expand our business and 
      maintain a best-in-class culture.”
    

      Prior to joining MasterCard, Fraccaro was a core member of the HR 
      leadership team at HSBC Group for nearly 12 years, based in Hong Kong. 
      Earlier, he held senior HR positions in banking and financial services 
      in Australia and the Middle East, working extensively across different 
      cultures.
    

      Fraccaro holds a Masters of Applied Science, Communication Management 
      from the University of Technology, Sydney and a Bachelor of Education 
      from the Australian Catholic University. He also has accreditation in 
      change management from the Australian Graduate School of Management and 
      attended leadership programs at Duke Fuqua and INSEAD.
