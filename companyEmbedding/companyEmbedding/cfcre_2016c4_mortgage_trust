      Fitch to Rate CFCRE 2016-C4 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





April 27, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the Cantor Commercial Real 
      Estate CFCRE 2016-C4 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating 
      Outlooks as follows:
    

      --$32,507,800 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,787,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$54,000,000 class A-HR 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$596,975,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,000,000b class X-HR 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$37,799,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$37,799,000b class X-C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$62,997,000 class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$37,799,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$45,148,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20,999,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,450,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of April 25, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the following classes:
    

      --$37,798,889 class X-G;
    

      --$37,798,889 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 50 loans secured by 154 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $839.9 
      million as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., Societe Generale and 
      Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 66.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 89.0%, and asset summary reviews on 89.0% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool has higher leverage statistics than other 
      recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's 
      Fitch DSCR of 1.12x is below the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average of 
      1.17x and full-year 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's Fitch LTV of 
      109.3% is above the YTD 2016 average of 107.9% and in line with the 
      full-year 2015 average of 109.3%.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 11.6% 
      of the initial pool balance prior to maturity, which is better than 
      recent fixed-rate transactions and slightly worse than the 2015 average 
      of 11.7%. Nine loans (30.2%) are full-term interest-only, and 12 loans 
      (28.7%) are partial interest-only. Fitch-rated transactions YTD 2016 
      have an average full-term interest-only percentage of 31.3% and a 
      partial interest-only percentage of 41.0%.
    

      Less Concentrated Pool: The largest 10 loans in the transaction compose 
      47.8% of the pool by balance. Compared to other Fitch-rated U.S. 
      multiborrower deals, the concentration in this transaction is lower than 
      the YTD 2016 and full-year 2015 average concentrations of 55.8% and 
      49.3%, respectively. The pool's concentration results in a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 348, which is lower than the 2015 average 
      of 367.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 15.8% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CFCRE 2016-C4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in 
      which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 12-13.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

2.          
Servicing of the Mortgage Loan . (a)  Each Holder
acknowledges and agrees that, subject in each case to the specific
terms of this Agreement, the Mortgage Loan shall be serviced as
follows:

 

(i)          from
and after the C4 Securitization Date, but prior to the Note A-2
Securitization Date, by the Note A-1 Master Servicer and the
Special Servicer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the C4
PSA; and

 

(ii)        from
and after the Note A-2 Securitization Date, by the Note A-2 Master
Servicer and the Special Servicer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the Note A-2 PSA.

 

Each Holder agrees to reasonably
cooperate with each Servicer with respect to its exercise of its
rights and obligations under the Servicing Agreement.

 

(b)        Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Holder hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the appointment of the
Master Servicer and the Trustee under the Servicing Agreement by
the Depositor and the appointment of the Special Servicer by the
Directing Holder and agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Master
Servicer and the Special Servicer with respect to the servicing of
the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing Agreement. Each
Holder hereby appoints the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer
and the Trustee under the Servicing Agreement as such
Holder’s attorney-in-fact to sign any documents reasonably
required with respect to the administration and servicing of the
Mortgage Loan on its behalf under the Servicing Agreement (subject
at all times to the rights of the Holders as set forth herein and
in such Servicing Agreement).

 

(c)        If,
at any time the Lead Note is no longer in a Securitization, the
Note A-2 Holder shall cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced
pursuant to a servicing agreement that is substantially similar to
the Servicing Agreement (and, if any Non-Lead Note is in a
Securitization, a Rating Agency Confirmation from the Rating
Agencies that were engaged by the Depositor to rate such
Securitization) and all references herein to the “
Servicing Agreement ” shall mean such subsequent
Servicing Agreement; provided , however , that until
a replacement Servicing Agreement has been entered into (and such
written confirmation has been obtained), the Note A-1 Holder shall
cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced pursuant to the provisions
of the Servicing Agreement as if such agreement was still in full
force and effect with respect to the Mortgage Loan; provided
, further , however , that until a replacement
Servicing Agreement is in place, the actual servicing of the
Mortgage Loan may be performed by any Qualified Servicer appointed
by the Note A-2 Holder and does not have to be performed by the
service providers set forth under the Servicing Agreement that was
previously in effect.

 

(d)        Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein (including
Sections 4 and 13(a) ), each Servicing Agreement
shall provide that the Servicer shall be required to service and
administer the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing
Standard as set forth in such Servicing Agreement, and any Holder
who is not a Borrower or an Affiliate of a Borrower shall be deemed
a third-party beneficiary of such provisions of the Servicing
Agreement. It is understood that any Non-Lead Note Holder may
separately appoint a servicer for its Non-Lead Note, by itself or
together with other assets, but any such servicer will have
no

 

-17-


 


 

responsibility hereunder and shall
be compensated solely by the applicable Non-Lead Note Holder from
funds payable to it hereunder or otherwise.

 

(e)        The
Holders acknowledge that the Servicer is to comply with this
Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Documents in connection with the
servicing of the Mortgage Loan.

 

(f)         If
any Note is included as an asset of a real estate mortgage
investment conduit (a “ REMIC ”), within the
meaning of Section 860D(a) of the Code, then, any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding: (i) the
Mortgage Loan shall be administered such that the Notes shall
qualify at all times as (or as interests in) a “qualified
mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of
the Code, (ii) any real property (and related personal
property) acquired by or on behalf of the Holders pursuant to a
foreclosure, exercise of a power of sale or delivery of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage or lien on such property
following a default on the Mortgage Loan shall be administered so
that the interest of the pro rata share of each Holder
therein shall at all times qualify as “foreclosure
property” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of
the Code, and (iii) no Servicer may modify, waive or amend any
provision of the Mortgage Loan, consent to or withhold consent from
any action of the Borrower, or exercise or refrain from exercising
any powers or rights that the Holders may have under the Mortgage
Loan Documents, if any such action would constitute a
“significant modification” of the Mortgage Loan, within
the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(b) of the regulations of the
United States Department of the Treasury, more than three (3)
months after the startup day of the REMIC that includes any Note
(or any portion thereof). Each Holder agrees that the provisions of
this paragraph shall be effected by compliance with any REMIC
provisions in the Servicing Agreement relating to the
administration of the Mortgage Loan.

 

(g)        In
the event that one of the Notes is included in a REMIC, the other
Holders shall not be required to reimburse such Holder or any other
Person for payment of any taxes imposed on such REMIC or Advances
therefor or for any interest on such Advance or for deficits in
other items of disbursement or income resulting from the use of
funds for payment of any such taxes, nor shall any disbursement or
payment otherwise distributable to the other Holders be reduced to
offset or make-up any such payment or deficit.

 

3.          
Priority of Notes . Note A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-4,
Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7 and Note A-8 shall be of equal
priority, and no portion of any of Note A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3,
Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7 or Note A-8 shall have
priority or preference over any portion of the other Note or
security therefor. Except for the Excluded Amounts, all amounts
tendered by the Borrower or otherwise available for payment on the
Mortgage Loan, whether received in the form of Monthly Payments, a
balloon payment, Liquidation Proceeds, proceeds under any guaranty,
letter of credit or other instrument serving as security on the
Mortgage Loan, proceeds under title, hazard or other insurance
policies or awards or settlements in respect of condemnation
proceedings or similar exercise of the power of eminent domain
shall be distributed by the Master Servicer and applied to Note
A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7 and
Note A-8 on a Pro Rata and Pari Passu Basis.

 

-18-


 

 

The Servicing Agreement may provide
for the application of Penalty Charges paid in respect of the
Mortgage Loan to be used to (i) pay the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Special Servicer for interest accrued on any
Property Advances, (ii) to pay the parties to any
Securitization for interest accrued on any P&I Advance,
(iii) to pay certain other expenses incurred with respect to
the Mortgage Loan and (iv) to pay to the Master Servicer
and/or the Special Servicer as additional servicing compensation,
except that, for so long as any of Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-6,
Note A-7 or Note A-8 is not included in a Securitization, any
Penalty Charges allocated to any such note not in a securitization,
that are not applied pursuant to clauses (i)-(iii) above shall be
remitted to the respective Holder and shall not be paid to the
Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer without the express
consent of such Holder.

 

4.          
Workout .  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, but subject to the terms and conditions
of the Servicing Agreement and Section 13 of this
Agreement, and the obligation to act in accordance with the
Servicing Standard, if the Lead Note Holder, or any Servicer, in
connection with a workout or proposed workout of the Mortgage Loan,
modifies the terms thereof such that (i) the Mortgage Loan
Principal Balance is decreased, (ii) the Mortgage Interest
Rate is reduced, (iii) payments of interest or principal on
Note A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note
A-7 or Note A-8 are waived, reduced or deferred or (iv) any
other adjustment is made to any of the payment terms of the
Mortgage Loan, such modification shall not alter, and any
modification of the Mortgage Loan Documents shall be structured to
preserve, the equal priorities of Note A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3,
Note A-4, Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7 and Note A-8 as described in
Section 3 .

 

5.          
Accounts; Payment Procedure .  The Servicing
Agreement shall provide that the Master Servicer shall establish
and maintain the Collection Account or Collection Accounts, as
applicable. Each of the Note A-1, Note A-2, Note A-3, Note A-4,
Note A-5, Note A-6, Note A-7 and Note A-8 Holder hereby directs the
Master Servicer, in accordance with the priorities set forth in
Section 3 her

The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 28, 2016.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 37 loans secured by 64 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $652,913,725 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Cantor 
      Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., Societe Generale, and UBS AG, New 
      York Branch.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 77.6% of the properties by balance, asset 
      summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool, and cash flow analysis of 89.8% 
      of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Fitch Leverage: The transaction has slightly better leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) for the 
      trust of 103.0% is below the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average of 105.5%. 
      The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for the trust of 1.19x is 
      similar to the YTD 2016 average of 1.20x. Excluding credit opinion 
      loans, the pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.13x and 110.2%, respectively. 
      Comparatively, the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and LTV for Fitch-rated 
      deals excluding credit-opinion and co-op loans are 1.16x and 109.9%.


                                        








Above-Average Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 61.9% of the 
      pool, which is greater than the recent averages of 54.6% for YTD 2016 
      and 49.3% for 2015. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) and 
      sponsor concentration index (SCI) are 488 and 548, respectively, greater 
      than the respective YTD 2016 averages of 421 and 494.


                                        








Investment-Grade Credit-Opinion Loans: Two loans in the pool, Hilton 
      Hawaiian Village (8.7% of pool) and Potomac Mills (6.2% of pool), have 
      investment-grade credit opinions. Hilton Hawaiian Village has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Potomac Mills has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a 
      stand-alone basis. The two loans have a weighted average Fitch DSCR and 
      LTV of 1.56x and 62.0%, respectively. The proportion of credit-opinion 
      loans in this pool of 14.9% is well above the YTD 2016 average of 7.7%.


                                        








Limited Amortization: Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the 
      pool will pay down by only 7.8%, which is below the YTD 2016 average of 
      10.5%. Twelve loans, representing 50.5% of the pool, are full-term 
      interest only, and nine loans, representing 15.6% of the pool, are 
      partial interest only. The remainder of the pool is made up of 16 
      balloon loans, representing 33.9% of the pool, with loan terms of five 
      to 10 years.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 17.7% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CFCRE 2016-C7 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'Asf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could occur. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
