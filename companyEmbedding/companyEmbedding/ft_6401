Item #: MPR-1411R-PA



			The MPR Series Hinged Glass Door Refrigerators from Panasonic are designed to meet regulatory guidelines and strict temperature requirements necessary for storing pharmaceuticals, medicines, vaccines, and other temperature-sensitive biologicals. In addition, they are ideal for various clinical research, pharmaceutical, and industrial laboratory applications including chromatography and pharmaceutical storage. The MPR-1411R-PA refrigerator features a unique, electronically monitored defrost cycle, which initiates only when needed to minimize temperature fluctuations. The stainless steel pull-out drawers allow for convenient, space-efficient storage of large bottles, reagent kits, or patient medications while the standard alarm and safety features monitor critical parameters and alert you of irregular temperature fluctuations within the cabinet. The MPR Series Refrigerators have all the right features for even the strictest application including: advanced temperature controls, precise uniformity, temperature stability, and accurate alarms and monitoring.

			 


		 

Product Features:


			ENERGY STAR Certified

			Wide Operating Range: With a temperature range of 2°C to 23°C, Panasonic’s MPR Series refrigerators are ideally suited for many reagents and biologicals that require a stable, cool temperature, or general cold storage environment.

			Microprocessor Controls: The microprocessor and the electronic temperature controls ensure that the set temperature is maintained, without being affected by the ambient temperature.

			Performance: For frequent door openings, Panasonic’s MPR Series refrigerators are equipped with powerful, hermetically sealed compressors that ensure superior pulldown characteristics, energy efficiency, and precise temperature control.

			Large Fans: The double 4.7”-diameter fans create a double flow system to ensure even temperatures throughout the cabinet. Because of this, heat spots from a powered test apparatus are minimized, while recovery characteristics after door openings remain outstanding.

			Easy-to-Manage Layout: The interior layout flexibility of the MPR Series refrigerators makes them ideal for running experiments that require changeable shelf configurations.

			Drawers: The “R” model is fitted with stainless steel pull-out drawers. These drawers are deep enough to hold large bottles or reagent kits. They allow for convenient and space-efficient storage.

			Alarm and Safety Features: Panasonic’s MPR Series refrigerators are fitted with alarms and flashing indicator LED to warn of high and low temperature conditions. Door locks are standard to safeguard valuable contents.

			User Friendly Design & Double Door Function: The broad, solid frames with effective gaskets ensure excellent temperature stability, while double-pane glass windows offer an excellent view of the interior. Optional panels are available to block out light

Four great reasons to buy!

                    Here are four great reasons to consider buying a home today, instead of waiting.

1. Prices Will Continue to Rise
CoreLogic's latest Home Price Index reports that home prices have appreciated by 7.1% over the last 12 months. The same report predicts that prices will continue to increase at a rate of 4.9% over the next year.

The bottom in home prices has come and gone. Home values will continue to appreciate for years. Waiting no longer makes sense.

2. Mortgage Interest Rates Are Projected to Increase
Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey shows that interest rates for a 30-year mortgage have remained around 4%. Most experts predict that they will begin to rise over the next 12 months. The Mortgage Bankers Association, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac & the National Association of Realtors are in unison, projecting that rates will increase by this time next year.

An increase in rates will impact YOUR monthly mortgage payment. A year from now, your housing expense will increase if a mortgage is necessary to buy your next home.

3. Either Way, You are Paying a Mortgage
There are some renters who have not yet purchased a home because they are uncomfortable taking on the obligation of a mortgage. Everyone should realize that, unless you are living with your parents rent-free, you are paying a mortgage - either yours or your landlord's.

As an owner, your mortgage payment is a form of 'forced savings' that allows you to have equity in your home that you can tap into later in life. As a renter, you guarantee your landlord is the person with that equity.

Are you ready to put your housing cost to work for you? 

4. It's Time to Move on with Your Life
The 'cost' of a home is determined by two major components: the price of the home and the current mortgage rate. It appears that both are on the rise.

But what if they weren't? Would you wait?

Look at the actual reason you are buying and decide if it is worth waiting. Whether you want to have a great place for your children to grow up, you want your family to be safer or you just want to have control over renovations, maybe now is the time to buy.

If the right thing for you and your family is to purchase a home this year, buying sooner rather than later could lead to substantial savings.

                    St. Augustine is a city located within St. Johns County, and is a beautiful place to call home! It's known as "The Nation's Oldest City" because of it's heritage dating back to 1565, not because of age demographics! This is also the origin of "First Coast" references you will see in Northeast Florida. Housing in the city itself is limited to mostly historic type structures, and newer homes built in older established neighborhoods. There's quite an assortment and is perfect for people seeking unique and different architecture opportunities. Along the bayfront are located some of the area's most valuable addresses, and are walking distance to all of the historic sites downtown. While downtown St. Augustine is relatively small, venturing out into the county at large will provide you with many different types of housing opportunities and where the newest developments are located.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
