Description


Todd has fifteen years in game and twelve years of teaching thousands of men how be successful with women everywhere from Toronto to Tokyo.

He's doing Immersion, Bootcamp, Hotseat, Valentine University, Inner Circle, Vblogs, 3 Girls a Day & his masterpiece Daygame. Now you know why he always looks tired. 

While he never studied psychology, he probably knows the mind of a woman better than she does. Sun up, sun down, mobile, laptop, or desktop: no charisma, no state = no problem.

He has the best hair out of all the RSD instructors. For the last two years Todd has lived in Las Vegas, where he practices game and pulls the hottest women from the best clubs in the world just about every night of the week and is an expert at meeting women during the day.

Johnianos3 months agoHi Todd.. Big fun over here.. Could u make a video about how to make women perceive us not for relationship exclusives?! I have found myself being wanted only for relationship so many times.. and i have lost  opportunities because i could not escape that situation.. and as we know women can understand somehow what we really want.. Here in Greece also women are so afraid of being called sluts.. i believe i have learnt some things from you for that part but i am so worried about the first one!﻿Read more

DerClaudius5 months ago (edited)Yes, I already thought this is a bad decision when I saw your first promotions for Women... I mean you artificially cap your earnings this way(closing enrollment)... Some people don't have the time or money now, but maybe would love to buy it in a month or two or they just haven't heard about it etc...
I understand you can't offer the full experience for people joining late, but what prevents you from marketing it as "You only get the live workshop bonus if you sign up till date x, after that you only get access to the material" ... I mean this is like sellign a book for only 2 weeks or having a movie in the cinema only for two weeks. I get that you want to create urgency and you did that with the 200$ off and you also would do it with the limited access to the live workshop, but cutting the accessibility completely seems like a bad move from a business standpoint - why miss out on the long tail, which especially for virtual products can bring a substantial amount of additional income?﻿Read more

Nietzschean Middleman6 months ago (edited)Todd, you should do a 'Ghost of Christmas Past" themed video where you never joined RSD. You would arise and go to your Mechanical Engineering job at Schlumbereger or General Dynamics or Siemens.  You punch in, dressed like a typical engineer with pocket protector, sheepishly say a tentative 'hello' to the "7" who works at the reception desk, get out alpha'd by some geek at the water cooler, (like Christian Glover in one of the Back to the Future movies,  or like Jeffy's 'non-woo' character ). Then Tyler visits you at night and shows you how it could be, then you change. This would be awesome.   There are so many engineers at Carnegie Mellon and other places that NEED to see that video.﻿Read more

QuentinQuark6 months agoHi Todd, wondering if Opening Mastery will be part of Women? I missed OM, wouldn't have been able to attend a live event anyways, but I think I would really benefit from some intense work on opening, it's a horrible sticking point for me. Thanks bro you're awesome!﻿Read more

Ross Marks6 months agoI have a crisis in my life. I am 32 been fucked twice, and have read a lot about pick up and personal development. I have no friends, can't hold down a job, was homeless this last little while over it. I am beside myself with lonelyness and don't know how to fix this. As best as I can figure, I make men insecure, recent example is when I was at the bar the other evening, just trying to be social, chatted up a guy sitting next to me, two girls rolled up and where trying hard to get either our or my attention. Instantly the conversation went to a challenge to a fight. We ended up bullshitting for two hours over beer, let the girls go. Another recent event, my roomate who scores nearly every night, and with different women, had a girl over he was really interested in, I kept my mouth shut let him lead the show, she tapped me on the foot hard, i don't know if she was trying to make him jealous, trying to give me a shot of confidence, or legit interested... but now this guy who gets laid all the time is more or less a giant threat display to m e, and it feels like he is trying to get me kicked out of my house. Work is the same story, the moment any girl gives me attention ( I work in service industry) the men turn on me, I've never been able to hold down a job longer than six months, the one job that did last six months, I was ausaulted numerous times, tripped in the change room, etc etc etc... eventually management cut me a check and said it wasn't worth it. I feel like the only thing saving my ass at my current job, is the fact that management, (women) like me... I really need help.﻿Read more

peachie057 months agoIs this really what you want to do with your life? Perpetuate misogyny and spread lies about women so that all your needy followers continue spreading woman-hate and abusing women? What a waste of a life. Karma will seriously kick your ass someday.﻿Read more

Anon amous7 months agoTodd, thank you so much for your knowledge.  It has helped me greatly in my marriage.  I think after marriage men begin to kill their wives’ attraction by providing too much comfort and not enough value, because that’s what we’ve been taught to do.  Of course, in some cases we get too caught up in our careers and provide too much value and not enough comfort.  In either case, I think you would have a great business opportunity and also provide a tremendous service to the 50% divorce rate, by doing videos, seminars and perhaps a book for married men on how to keep the attraction of their wives.  Teaching married men what a shit test is and how to handle it.  When to provide value, when to provide comfort.  How to do push-pull, and all the other techniques married men need.  The principles you’ve discovered are almost like Newton discovering the laws of motion.  It’s difficult to imagine the impact they could have on marriage.﻿Read more

Crintleod10 months agoTodd I am a huge fan, but there is a huge void in your training videos. You should go over how to approach a girl who is in a group of friends. I'm finding there to be a huge difference between approaching, opening, and framing with a girl who's by herself compared to a girl who is the quiet one in a group of friends.﻿Read more

Masculinity Super Mega Energy Unleashed: Reclaim The Deep Aura Warrior Force For Alpha Awesomeness

          As you may have guessed from the title, this is not your typical "masculinity" video. In fact I hate the way the word "masculinity", or worse yet, "masculine energy" are used in most cases. Among other things, the most masculine thing you can do is to STOP DISCUSSING MASCULINITY and just take purposeful action!http://valentinelife.com for more from me

				Good shocks, changed the feel of bumps and feeling of control, well made. Wish I would have went with them in the first place instead of trying oem - oem shocks are usually junk I now know. everyone said these were the setuo for my toyota pickup and I now know it was true. recommended

			Not sure which 1993 Toyota Pickup Suspension Systems are right for you? We have over 6546 customer reviews, with an average rating of 4.5, to help you find exactly what you're looking for. Here's what some of our customers have said:"Good shocks, changed the feel of bumps and feeling of control, well made. Wish I would have went with them in the first place instead of trying oem - oem shocks are usually junk I now know. everyone said these were the setuo for my toyota pickup and I now know it was true. recommended"  —Edward G from Blue Lake, CA bought a Bilstein Heavy Duty Shocks for a 1993 Toyota Pickup."I went with the skyjacker shocks and the steering stabilizer after I changed to bigger wheels and tires. I have a 2 inch lift on the truck and they fit perfect. The truck is nice and tight and handles and rides so much better. I would recommend another set of hands with the stabilizer. It is somewhat heavy to install with just one person but it went well"  —Leroy W from Maiden, NC bought a Skyjacker Hydro 7000 Steering Stabilizers for a 1993 Toyota Pickup."The Belltech lowering blocks were not right but that was my fault. They worked because I made them. They were shipped quickly and accurately. Thanks Autoanything."  —Ashley S from Slidell, LA bought a Belltech Lowering Block Kit for a 1993 Toyota Pickup."Good shocks, changed the feel of bumps and feeling of control, well made.

The front were really easy to install. Over all for the price a good deal."  —Brent B from Ocala, FL bought a Skyjacker Hydro 7000 Shocks for a 1993 Toyota Pickup."I got these to replace stock. The original shocks were a pain to remove (no fault of the rs9000xl's), but once they were off, the Ranchos were easy to install. It took me all of an hour for both front and rear. I have driven around with them at setting #9 (stiff) and #1 (soft). For daily driving, I keep them at #1 for a smooth ride."  —Ian R from Alexandria, VA bought a Rancho RS9000XL Shocks for a 1993 Toyota Pickup."I went with the skyjacker shocks and the steering stabilizer after I changed to bigger wheels and tires.

It came with all of the custom brackets and hardware, so I really didn't mind. A monkey could install this thing. This thing is about 3x the diameter of the factory stabilizer. I have 32" tires now and will soon move up to a 33x12.5 or 285/75/16 tire, so this is a must have mod. Couldn't be happier."  —Shawn K from Monkton, MD bought a Skyjacker Silver 9000 Steering Stabilizers for a 1993 Toyota Pickup.In addition to Toyota Pickup Suspension Systems, you may also enjoy one of these popular products: Street Scene 3.5" Round Driving Lights Kit, Zymol Titanium Glaze, Bracketron Mobile Grip-iT Windshield Mount.
