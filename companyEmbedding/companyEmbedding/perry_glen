 oneself, that will definitely magnet attraction to the crowd. The lively, dazzling mixture opens with the rosy nuance of petitgrain that induces a green accent on top. It also has the zesty juice of lemon and orange, conjuring a sweet and succulent aroma that educes vibrancy. The intensely sugary facet of cardamom follows with a touch of the balsamic trail of fir. For the middle notes, it is comprised of the smooth and relaxing elements of flowers. The narcotic mist of jasmine enters, in harmony with the intensely romantic accent of rose. It is fused with the minty, herbaceous note of rosemary, followed by the pure and clean touch of lily of the valley. It eventually dries down to earthy accords through the musky and sensual notes of vetiver, musk, oakmoss, and rosewood. Whether you’re out for a walk, going to a party, or heading to a meeting, inner force will definitely leave you with a remarkable impression! from its scent down to its packaging, this extraordinary scent unveils a person’s unique personality. It arrives in a 3.4 ounce minimalist, blue glass flacon, topped with a silver cap. This perfume is wrapped in a pastel blue box with an inner force label in white. Glenn perri is a house of fragrance based in paris. The company’s fragrances are named as extraordinary as its actual scents. To name a few, some of their perfumes are unpredictable lady, unforgettable, unbelievable, unexpected men, and unpredictable night. All products are original, authentic name brands. We do not sell knockoffs or imitations.

Customer Comments

                                            I wondered what the catch was...my fragrance in a large quantity for a very inexpensive price. I received my order on time, and it was exactly what I wanted. I would order from FragranceX again.M. Phillips (Middleville, MI)

                                            Dear Claudie & Marianna,  We were so sorry to hear about Perry.  We can't even imagine the sorrow you both are feeling.  He was a precious son and you both took such good care of him.  Know you both are in our prayers.  We are sad that we can't make the funeral.  Know we are there in spirit.

Praying that you feel the love and support from your family and friends.  We pray you can feel God's loving arms around you.  Our thought and prayers are with you.  Hugs!

"Astrology is a gift from God―or the gods, if you will―a sacred language writtenin the heavens informing, inspiring, and guiding us back to Source.”

 



 







What Is...


AstroPsychology is a brand of psychological astrology characterized by uncommon rigor, structure, and precision. While firmly grounded in horoscopic astrology’s 2000 year tradition, it builds on this foundation by incorporating concepts from depth psychology, integral spirituality, and new paradigm sciences. Jung’s archetypal model is a central thread, but we borrow from other schools of thought, too, including psychodynamic theory and developmental psychology. Forged in the fires of actual psychotherapeutic practice, the resultant synthesis accelerates insight and deepens empathic rapport with clients.

Who Is...

Glenn Perry, Ph.D.
For the past 35 years, I’ve worked as a licensed psychotherapist in private practice using astrology as a diagnostic and prognostic tool. This website represents the accumulation of learning that’s resulted. Eight books are offered as well as recordings of astrology lectures, seminars, and classes. For essays and position papers, check out Articles above. Astrological consultations and psychotherapy with astrology are also available. If you’re a beginning student or experienced astrologer who wishes to go deeper, our cutting edge courses at the Academy of AstroPsychology are unparalleled.

Featured Product

Delineating the Personal Myth
This is a powerful twelve-week astrology course on chart synthesis with a focus on revealing the overall narrative theme of one birthchart each week. Utilizing an intensive case study approach supplemented by documents that attest to the subject’s actual life history, our goal is to illuminate the inner pattern of the life and, in turn, show how it correlates to events, experiences, and achievements for which the native is renowned. Handouts and slides accompany each week's astrology class. Horoscopes are of famous politicians, entertainers, scientists, artists, heroes and villains.
