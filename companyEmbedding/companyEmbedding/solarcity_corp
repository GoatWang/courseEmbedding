We're out to changethe way the world gets power











Making clean,Solar energy accessible for all

Founded in 2006, SolarCity has revolutionized the way energy is delivered--providing homeowners, businesses, schools and governments a more affordable and sustainable alternative to electricity from utilities.
As America's largest solar provider, we continue to help people take control of their energy costs and decrease their carbon footprint.






Simplifying Solar

When we set out to transform the way people get power, we knew we had to make the process as simple as possible. That's why we handle every aspect of a project from start to finish. And we back it all up with the best warranty in the industry and a performance guarantee for the life of the contract.
Learn More














Solar ona national scale

SolarCity currently offers service in many states throughout the country. And we don't just generate clean energy in those states--we generate local jobs that strengthen communities. Our customers include over 300,000 homeowners, more than 400 schools and universities, thousands of businesses, as well as government entities of all sizes.
See if we're in your area.














Giving power to thosewho need it most

In 2014, SolarCity founded the GivePower Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing clean, reliable energy to the developing world. GivePower helps create better lives for people in impoverished communities through the power of solar--from improving access to food and water to better equipping health centers to increasing opportunities for students and entrepreneurs.

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

History[edit]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

History[edit]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

SolarCity opened its operations in October 2016 and had covered a triangular area between Charleston, Columbia and near Hilton Head Island.

Solar panels that power savings









Raising the bar, not the price




Affordability
We can offer you the best technology at the best price. With the most financing options in the industry, whatever plan you choose, you’ll save money on your monthly utility bill. Learn more about our financing options.





Quality
Our panels outperform others by 10 years due to rigorous testing beyond industry standards. We cover all roofing work and system repairs at no extra cost. See how we choose our suppliers and equipment.Download the pdf.





Savings
Solar is far less expensive than traditional electricity in most places across the U.S. With $0 down, you’ll secure a low fixed monthly rate and save on your utility bill.









Sleeker than the rest

Our solar panel systems look right at home on your roof with a super sleek, low profile design. With integrated front skirts and no visible hardware, we offer a clean look that our competitors can only admire. See for yourself.

How Solar Works

See how solar energy works with the grid to power your home at various times of the day.















As the sun rises, your system begins producing power.  When you're consuming more power than your solar is producing, you may still draw power from the grid.

During the day, your system can generate more power than you are consuming. This extra power goes back to the grid where it can be used by your neighbors.

At night, while you're not producing solar energy, your home gets its power from the grid.



As the sun rises, you are paying for solar energy—typically at a lower rate—instead of energy from your utility company. For the energy you are not producing yourself, you pay the utility company the regular rate.

When you're producing more energy than you're consuming, you get a credit against your future consumption.

The solar credit you've accumulated during the day offsets the higher energy cost you incur from the grid at night.







Power your world, your way

Get control over energy costs and save on your monthly bill while making your planet a better place with clean, renewable energy.

History[edit]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

History[edit]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]

SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Answer:

The best way to determine how much solar you need is to have the solar installer get up on you roof to evaluate it prior to providing you with a solar proposal. The size of the solar system is determined by your roof size, pitch and shading issues as well as the annual kilowatt (kW) usage for each individual home. You and your neighbor could have the exact same size home but entirely different electric usage habits and would each require a different sized system to offset your usage. An average size installation in the Bay Area is between...

History[edit]

SolarCity was founded in 2006 by brothers Peter and Lyndon Rive,[2] based on a suggestion for a solar company concept by their cousin, Elon Musk, who is the chairman and helped start the company.[3]
By 2009 solar panels it had installed were generating 440 megawatts (MW) of power.[4][5]
In 2013, according to GTM Research, it was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.;[6] Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S..[7] SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from Paramount Equity for $120 million in 2013.[8]
It had installed panels generating 6,200 MW of power by 2014.[4] In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,[9] approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.[4]
In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the United States.[10] In March 2016 SpaceX bought $90 million of SolarCity stock.[11]
In late 2015, following a successful run during its initial years in Nevada, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in the state, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's net metering rule.[12] Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90 and will continue to rise, reaching $38.51 by Jan. 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and will continue to decline over the ensuing four years.[12] As a result, the company eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.[12]
In June 2016, Musk's car company, Tesla, formally submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.[13] According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful".[14] On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of 2.6 billion. Other steps to finalize the merger will not complete until later in 2016.[15] As of August 2016[update], Musk owned 22% of SolarCity stock.[16]
In August 2016, it was announced that the company plans to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company was also cutting the salary of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.[17]
2016 workforce reduction[edit]
On March 2, 2017 it was announced that SolarCity eliminated 3,000 jobs in 2016, which is equivalent to 20% of its total workforce. This information was disclosed in a regulatory filing the previous day.[18] The company did so to preserve cash.[19]
The job cuts affected workers across the entire company:[18] operations, installations, manufacturing, and sales and marketing.[20] In operations, installations, and manufacturing, 22% of jobs were cut. In sales and marketing, 27% of jobs were cut. 2016 was the first year in the company's history that SolarCity cut its workforce.[21]
At the end of 2016, SolarCity had 12,243 employees; at the end of 2015, it had 15,273 employees.[18] In 2015, the number of employees had grown by 68.7%.[20]
By August 2016, co-founder brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive reduced their salaries to one dollar per year.[21]
Before Tesla acquired SolarCity, the company announced job cuts but didn't cite any specific numbers.[20]
The chief policy officer of SolarCity, John Wellinghoff, left SolarCity in April 2017. According to Utility DIVE, "The reasons why Wellinghoff left are unclear, and his LinkedIn page says he works at Policy/DER Consulting, a firm assisting emerging energy tech companies navigate complex policy barriers. E&E News reports he started the firm and Tesla is one of his clients."[22] He previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He was hired after the state of Nevada reduced compensation to rooftop solar users.[22]
Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016-present)[edit]
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger. Tesla's mission since its inception has been to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. As part of Elon Musk's "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan", Tesla sought to expedite the world's move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.[23] The announcement cited operational and cost "synergies", and integrated products would be realized with the merger. The action was approved by antitrust regulators.[24][25] More than 85% of unaffiliated shareholders from Tesla and SolarCity voted to approve the acquisition on November 17, 2016,[26][27] which was closed on the morning of November 21, 2016.[28]
Tesla's 2017 goals are to launch a new car, open a large battery factory, and "perfect autonomous driving." In November 2016 Musk called the merger a "no-brainer" for SolarCity. He said that it was an accident of history that Tesla and SolarCity were two separate companies before the merger. SolarCity was founded by Musk's cousins.[29] Lyndon Rive left the company in June 2017,[30] and Peter Rive announced in July 2017 he would be leaving also.[31]
Locations[edit]
Headquarters are in San Mateo, California, while the company uses a distributed service model in which it provides installation from local operations centers. As of May 2016, SolarCity operates in 20 jurisdictions: Hawaii, the District of Columbia, and 18 other states on the West Coast, in the Southwest, and in the Northeast.[32]
Products, services and technologies[edit]
Solar leasing[edit]
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners.[33] SolarCity's solar lease can allow some homeowners, by adopting solar power, to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.[34][35]
SolarCity leases rooftop solar to customers who pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers pay for 20 years for power generated by those panels. That business model drained cash from SolarCity while it was growing. Beginning in 2017, the company is shifting its business model to one where customers buy the solar systems with cash or via financing.[18] Tesla, the parent company, is also changing how solar is sold: in Tesla's stores, which will save on advertising.[19]
Commercial solar[edit]
In May 2008, the company completed what was, at the time, the largest commercial solar installation in San Jose on the North Campus of eBay. That July, SolarCity completed what was then the largest commercial solar installation in San Francisco, for British Motor Car Distributors, consisting of 1,606 solar photovoltaic panels.[36][37] SolarCity introduced new financing options for businesses in 2009[38] and has built multiple solar projects for other large organizations including Walmart,[39][40] Intel,[41] and the U.S. military.[42] On March 21, 2013 SolarCity announced that it would open a new location in Nevada[clarification needed] in cooperation with state government.[43]
Electric vehicle chargers[edit]
See also: Charging station
SolarCity entered the electric car charging business in 2006 by buying the SolSource Energy business of Clean Fuel Connections, Inc., which was reported to be finalized in 2009[44] and announced in 2011 a partnership with Rabobank to make electric car charging available for free to owners of Tesla's vehicles traveling on U.S. Route 101 in California between San Francisco and Los Angeles. The technology was open to all makes of cars that can make use of the same charging technology.[45] In 2011, the company announced it would install electric car chargers that could charge a wide range of EVs in all of its service territories.[46][47][needs update]
Energy efficiency evaluations and retrofits[edit]
In 2010, SolarCity acquired Building Solutions, a home energy audit firm, and began to offer energy efficiency evaluations and upgrades.[48] SolarCity worked with Admiral's Bank of Boston in March 2012 to make a new loan available to finance energy efficiency improvements[49] and expanded its energy efficiency services to the east coast.[50]
SolarStrong project[edit]
SolarStrong is SolarCity's five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in solar photovoltaic projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States, announced in late 2011.[51] SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, which would make it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history if completed. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on initial debt financing for SolarStrong.[52]
Energy storage[edit]
Tesla and Panasonic will open the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada in 2017, and plan to make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device will be sold to companies including SolarCity.[53][54] SolarCity is running a pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[55][56] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[57] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[58]
Installation technology[edit]
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by Zep Solar, which it acquired in 2013.[59] Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches to shorten installation time.[60] Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.[61]
Solar roof[edit]
In the August 2016 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Solar City would be introducing a new product where the photovoltaic electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, stating "It’s not a thing on a roof. It is the roof,"[62] as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.[63] Assorted styles of solar roof tiles, made of glass, were unveiled at Universal Studios' Colonial Street backlot street set in late October 2016. Also unveiled was the Tesla Powerwall 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.[64] Consumer Reports compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.[65][66]
Government-funded collaboration[edit]
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption in order to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.[67]
In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing radically new approaches to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."[68]
SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Departments National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Hawaiian Electric Company. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaiian residential customers connect to solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.[69]
Litigation and investigations[edit]
SolarCity sued Salt River Project, an electric utility, for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act on March 2, 2015,[70] case number 2:15-cv-00374, being heard before judge Douglas L Rayes.[71] This is in response to Salt River imposing a peak demand based charge on residential customers who also have solar panels.[72][needs update]
Buffalo Billion[edit]
Buffalo Billion is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The program's intention is to revitalize Buffalo New York in areas across Western New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity, which is the largest solar provider in the United States. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens." Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.[73]
The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to Daily Energy Insider, "The facility will have one gigawatt of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 solar panels per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.[73]
As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to the New York Times, Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players — including developers and frequent donors to the governor — who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money."[74]
On April 29, 2016, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.[75]
The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.[74]
In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for wire fraud and bribery and alleged bid rigging of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.[73]
An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.[74]
The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.[73]
Oregon Attorney General investigation[edit]
On March 30, 2017, The Oregonian said that Campaign for Accountability, a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum to investigate solar panel sales practices[76] that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.[77]
According to The Oregonian, the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."[77]
The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the Oregon Department of Justice and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies."[77]
A spokesman for the Campaign for Accountability said, "Solar companies often seem to target vulnerable populations, leaving senior Oregonians and those living on fixed incomes with higher monthly utility costs and loans that often exceed what they can afford to pay, plunging them into debt."[77]
The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low - lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability."[77]
"Solar by Degree" project[edit]
After an investigation initiated by The Oregonian, Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant involved in a controversial solar power project at two Oregon universities, was indicted on two counts of first-degree forgery by a Marion County grand jury August 25, 2016. Shain, who is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, is a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the Oregon University System; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of Oregon State University and the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls.
The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was also the second developer on the project. According to KOIN-TV, "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."[79] The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project ultimately received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was indeed "made up", but given to him by someone else involved in the project.[80] Shain maintains his innocence and remains optimistic that his innocence will be proven in court. The tax credits involved were actually given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to The Oregonian, "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."[78] SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."[78] The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.[78]
Treasury Department inquiries[edit]
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, “If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.” The firm insisted that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. However a Treasury Department investigation or a federal audit could force SolarCity and other firms to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.[81]
SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity’s 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, “the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us.”[81]
Customer litigation[edit]
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum FICO score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a “fair” credit rating) as the cutoff. However, between 2014-2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers defaulted on their mortgages. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in “residential foreclosure action” based legal proceedings.[82]
In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the New York Times, "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial — being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank.”[82]
Customer cancellation investigation[edit]
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Sunrun and SolarCity in May 2017, looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.[83]
The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing." The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies’ health."[83]
According to the Wall Street Journal, "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."[83]

"Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn’t proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic’s lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn’t realize they had actually signed contracts."[83]

The Checks and Balances Project[edit]
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.[84]
Project financing and the Google Fund[edit]
SolarCity partners with banks, large corporations, and the asset-backed[85] market to create project finance funds to finance its lease and PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) options. SolarCity's financing partners have included Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Morgan Stanley, National Bank of Arizona and U.S. Bancorp, among others.[86][full citation needed] Among SolarCity's better-known financing partnerships was a $280 million fund created with Google to finance residential solar installations in June 2011. The Google Fund was the largest fund of its kind in the U.S., and Google's largest investment in clean energy.[87]
Recently, securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects by providing access to capital.[88][89] SolarCity offered the first U.S. asset-backed security in the solar industry in 2013.[90]
Manufacturing[edit]
In June 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in Buffalo, New York, in coordination with the SUNY Polytechnic Institute after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex will be a 1.2-million-square-foot (110,000 m2) facility that will cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.[91] With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.[92] Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.[93] In February 2016, CEO Lyndon Rive announced that due to delays incurred in the supply of machinery for the plant, production would begin 3 to 6 months later than planned, in summer 2017.[94]
The facility would be the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.[95][96] Panasonic is to handle production at the Buffalo plant, investing $256 million.[97] Both Panasonic and SolarCity/Silevo are developing similar but somewhat different HIT-technology, and Panasonic hopes to use SolarCity's 6-inch (150 mm) wafers combining the two companies' technologies at an efficiency of 22%.[98][99] SolarCity expects demand to outstrip the Buffalo production of 10,000 solar panels per day, and buys solar equipment from other manufacturers until more factories can be built. New York state has 120 days to consider other factories due to being the major fund source for the first factory.[100] New York State owns the building and most of the equipment, leasing it to SolarCity. Most of the work was completed by November 2016, when the Buffalo Billion project was under investigation, delaying state payments to contractors, but not influencing progress on completion of construction.[101] SolarCity started hiring in December 2016.[102]
Trade organization[edit]
The company is one of the founding members of The Alliance for Solar Choice, or TASC, which is a rooftop photovoltaic power station solar trade organization.[103]

SolarCity Corporation's Best Product in 2016 So Far
It's been a rough year in solar energy, but this new product could drive SolarCity Corp's future.

No matter how you slice it, 2016 has been rough for SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ:SCTY). The company has had to lower installation guidance multiple times, the cost to sell solar-power systems is rising, and now financing costs are going up as well.
Amid it all, SolarCity has brought a transformative product to market that could drive the company's results for years to come, but it hasn't gotten much attention because of Tesla Motors' drive to buy the company and the falling stock price. Here is SolarCity's best product of the year and why it could transform the company.

Solar leases, or power purchase agreements (PPA), have been the dominant financing method for rooftop solar sales for many years. It allows customers to put solar on their roofs for no money down and still gives them savings on their energy bill. All they have to do is sign a 20 year agreement to buy energy from a company like SolarCity. 
But flaws are starting to emerge in the leasing/PPA model. SolarCity's financing costs are going up and customers are starting to question whether it may save them more money to just buy a solar-power system. That's led to growing market share for cash sales and solar loans over the past year.
SolarCity saw this change coming a few years ago, but its first loan product, named MyPower, was a huge failure, largely because it was complex and had a bill based on energy production. In many ways it was a lease/PPA in disguise.
Earlier this year, SolarCity fixed that major gap in its offering and started selling solar loans to customers. Loans are as short as 10 years with a 2.99% interest rate or as long as 20 years with a 4.99% interest rate. And it could change the company's future.
The good (and bad) of solar loans
In a lot of ways, loans are much better for solar installers and customers. The solar installer gets cash upfront and doesn't have to take on the financing risk a lease or PPA comes with. In SolarCity's case, it gets all of the revenue from building the solar-power system upfront, which could help it become cash flow positive far more quickly than the lease/PPA model.
For the customer, he or she can take advantage of tax benefits and the solar-power system becomes an asset when he or she sells their home. A lease/PPA is by definition a liability he or she hopes a new homeowner will take on.
The downside is that it's much easier to compare the cost of solar-power systems being bought with cash or a loan. SolarCity doesn't have a product differentiation from competitors and uses many of the same components a local installer may use. So, now it's competing on cost.





Solar loans could be SolarCity's future
SolarCity needs to show that it can generate cash and become profitable, which is why loans will be key for the company, particularly if the Tesla Motors deal falls through. More upfront cash may come with lower margins, but that's better than seeing financing costs soar, strangling the business.
A few years from now, SolarCity may be a solar loan company, which would be a huge strategic shift from where it is today. And that would be good news for investors long-term.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
