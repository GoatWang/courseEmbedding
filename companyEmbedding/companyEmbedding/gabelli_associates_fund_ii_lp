                Closed-end funds carry a certain level of risk for investors.
		 		
				Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through a stock exchange. The Closed-end fund's investment
                return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the
                original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value
                (NAV) of the fund's portfolio.  The market price for a closed-end fund is based on supply and demand which
                fluctuates daily based on many factors, such as economic conditions and global events, investor sentiment, and
                security-specific factors. The possibility of a market decline should be considered market risk.
 				
				There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you can lose money by investing in a
                closed-end fund. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

    Returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower
    or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so, upon
    redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain the most recent month end
    performance information and a prospectus, please call 800-GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com 

	The performance does not reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges.
	Quarterly (Standardized)
    performance reflects the full effect of the front-end sales charge. Other Period Performance does not
    reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges. Please consult your financial advisor
    for prospectus and for more information on mutual fund sales charges.
	
	(a) Total returns and average annual returns reflect changes in share price, reinvestment of distributions,
	and are net of expenses. The net asset value of a Fund is
	reduced on the ex-dividend (payment) date by the amount if the dividend paid. Of course, returns represent
	past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment returns and the principal value of an
	investment will fluctuate. When shares are redeemed they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
	Investing in small capitalization securities involves special challenges because these securities may trade
	less frequently and experience more abrupt price movements than large capitalization securities. Investing
	in micro capitalization securities may involve greater risks than investments in small, medium and large
	capitalization securities because the securities are subject to more abrupt or erratic movements in price.
	Investments in foreign securities involves risks not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic
	issues, including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks. Investing in gold is considered
	speculative and is affected by a variety of worldwide economic, financial and political factors. Funds
	concentrating in specific sectors may experience greater fluctuations in value than funds that are more
	diversified.
	

	(1) Maximum Sales Charge for Class A shares is a percentage of the initial investment and may be
	reduced based on the size of your investment. Class B and C shares have a contingent deferred sales charge
	when you redeem your shares depending on your holding period. Please see the Fund's Prospectus or contact
	your Adviser for a complete description of the applicable sales charge.
	

	(2) Gross Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund reflected as a percentage of the Fund's average
	daily net assets and do not include any voluntary or contractual fee waivers or expense limitations as
	described in the Fund Prospectus.
	

	(3) Net Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund including any voluntary or contractual fee waivers
	or expense limitations as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets. Where applicable, please see
	the Fund's Prospectus or contact your Adviser for a complete description of the fee waiver or expense
	limitation, the effective date and the expiration date.
	
	The Fund's share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund's portfolio securities.
	Stocks are subject to market, economic and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investment
	returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate.  When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth
	less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund.
	

    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before
    investing. The prospectus, which contains more complete information about this and other matters, should be read
    carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, please call 800 GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com .
