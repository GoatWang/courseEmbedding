Item Description: Morris-Systems Publishing Co., Detroit, 1925. Hardcover. Book Condition: Very Good. First Edition. 1925. First Edition. 294 pages including photographs of Checker Association officials and players and tabular summaries of the various games played. The tournament was held at the Hotel Alamac in New York City in 1924. The gilt has largely faded off the title on the spine and there is a touch of wear on the corner tips. An unusual feature of the book are two photographs and a biography of Hall-of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson, who was a second vice president of the association. These must be among his last pictures since he died in 1925 at age 45.  Bookseller Inventory # KS626
