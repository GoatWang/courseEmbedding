Hot Dip GalvanizingProven performance and significant cost savingsHot dip galvanizing has been utilized for over 250 years to protect steel and iron from the destruction of corrosion.  The process, which has evolved over the years, entails dipping fabricated steel into a kettle of molten zinc.  The iron in the steel reacts with the zinc to form a tightly bonded alloy coating which protects the steel from corrosion. Galvanized steel has a significantly lower life cycle cost than other materials such as painted steel or epoxy coated surfaces, and requires no coating maintenance over its service life.
Trusted Experience and Expertise
A leading provider of hot-dip galvanizing and galvanized rebar, AZZ has 43 galvanizing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada providing maximum accessibility and thereby reducing transportation costs for our valued customers.  Our extensive experience and expertise extend to a broad range of applications including agriculture, bridge and highway, construction, electrical utilities, original equipment manufacturers, petrochemicals, recreation and transportation.

Why AZZ Inc. Missed Guidance 
The galvanizing and electrical products company failed to meet its own expectations and lowered guidance.











                Lee Samaha
            

                (TMFSaintGermain)



            
            Apr 21, 2017 at 11:36AM
            
            





It's never a good thing when a company misses its current full-year guidance and then promptly reduces its guidance for the coming fiscal year, but that's the reality of AZZ Inc.'s (NYSE:AZZ) fourth-quarter earnings report. A combination of weak ongoing end-market conditions and the bankruptcy of Westinghouse hit AZZ hard. In short, it was another difficult quarter for the company. Let's take a closer look at what went wrong
AZZ Inc. fourth-quarter earnings: The raw numbers
Starting with the headline numbers for the full year:

Full-year fiscal 2017 revenue of $858.9 million compared to previous guidance for revenue "slightly below" a guidance range of $930 million to $970 million.
Full-year EPS of $2.33 compared to previous guidance for "slightly below" a guidance range of $3.15 to $3.45. 

That previous guidance was last given on the second-quarter earnings release in October. Fast-forward to the disappointing set of third-quarter earnings released in January, and CEO Tom Ferguson said, "We are working toward issuing guidance for fiscal year 2018 within a few weeks. We will update our fiscal year 2017 full-year outlook at that time." 
Management promptly gave its full-year fiscal 2018 guidance in February, but made no mention of 2017 guidance on the release.

Guidance for 2018 reduced 
In addition to missing 2017 guidance, management reduced the 2018 guidance it gave just a couple of months ago. Here is the updated guidance compared to what was given in February:

Fiscal 2018 revenue of $880 million to $950 million compared to $900 million to $970 million.
Fiscal 2018 diluted EPS of $2.60 to $3.10 compared to $2.85 to $3.10.

Clearly, something's going wrong, but what?





What happened in AZZ Inc.'s fourth quarter?
Here's a breakout of segment sales, income, and margin in the quarter.

On the earnings call, Ferguson referred to generally weak end-market conditions for both segments thanks to "continued contraction in our markets due to the economic fallout of the low oil patch activity, lower solar opportunities, and a continued low level of major refinery turnarounds." 
But the pain doesn't stop there. There were significant declines in energy revenue, income, and margin. A major cause of this was the bankruptcy of Westinghouse -- a company Ferguson described as being a "fair-sized" customer of the energy segment.
Turning to the galvanizing segment, end-market demand was weak but there were also cost pressures from the rising price of zinc. Essentially, AZZ tried to pass the cost increase on, but as Senior VP Tim Pendley put it on the earnings call, "Competition has been reluctant to move in that direction, which has challenged some of our volume." The end result was a significant loss of revenue and operating income in the galvanizing segment, though operating margin was held to a small decline.
Looking ahead
On a more positive note, Pendley said of galvanizing: "We finally feel like we have hit the bottom there and then [are] bouncing back up." Moreover, management's overall guidance still implies revenue growth of 2.5% to 10.6%. There is not a lot AZZ's management can do about lost revenue in the energy segment due to the Westinghouse bankruptcy, or ongoing weakness in oil and gas, so most hopes will likely rest on an improvement in galvanizing in the back half of the year.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
