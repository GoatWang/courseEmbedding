	Item 1.01.





	Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement

	.





	 


	On April 25, 2017, First Savings Bank (the
	“Bank”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (the “Company”), Jonathan E.
	Handmaker and George M. Vredeveld, Jr. entered into an operating agreement, effective as of January 1, 2017 (the “Operating Agreement”),
	with respect to Q2 Business Capital, LLC (“Q2”), an Indiana-chartered limited liability company and a majority-owned
	subsidiary of the Bank. The Bank is the 51% majority member, and Messrs. Handmaker and Vredeveld are each 24.5% limited members,
	of Q2. The primary business of Q2 is to originate, purchase, invest in, and sell loans, or portions of loans, originated under
	one or more lending programs administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration.


	 


	The Operating Agreement governs the operations
	of Q2, and provides for Q2’s management by a Board of Managers consistent with its Articles of Organization. Among the provisions
	of the Operating Agreement are: (i) a limited duration right of the Bank to purchase the membership interests of the “minority
	members” (as defined), (ii) a limited duration right of the minority members to market for sale all of the membership interests
	of Q2; and (iii) a limited duration right of the “limited members” (as defined) to offer for sale all of the minority
	members’ membership interests to a potential acquirer of the Company or the Bank as a result of a “change in control”
	(as defined) of the Company or the Bank occurring during the duration period. For additional information regarding these and other
	provisions of the Operating Agreement, reference is made to the complete copy of the Operating Agreement, which is attached hereto
	as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.


	 


	In connection with entering into the Operating
	Agreement, the Bank entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Handmaker and Vredeveld, effective as of January 1, 2017 (each,
	an “Agreement”). Each Agreement contains substantially similar terms. Each Agreement has an initial term ending on
	September 30, 2020, subject to extension as provided for in the Agreement. Each Agreement provides for the Bank to pay cash severance
	to the individual if his employment is involuntarily terminated without cause (as defined in the Agreement) or if he voluntarily
	terminates employment with good reason (as defined in the Agreement), equal to the lesser of (i) base salary (as defined in the
	Agreement) for the remaining term of the Agreement or (ii) one times base salary. Each Agreement requires the individual to adhere
	to specified non-solicitation and non-competition covenants after termination of employment, except in the event of voluntary termination
	with good reason resulting from the Bank implementing certain changes to the credit standard guidelines other than those specified
	in the Operating Agreement. For additional information regarding these and other provisions of the Agreements, reference is made
	to the complete copies of the Agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 and incorporated in the Item 1.01 by reference.

	ARTICLE III – CAPITAL ACCOUNTS,

	Date, the Bank and the Limited Members have made an aggregate initial cash capital contribution to the Company of one thousand
	dollars ($1,000), as follows:

	The Bank shall maintain
	at least a 51% membership interest in the Company at all times during which it maintains a membership interest in the Company.


	 


	The Members shall
	not be required to make any additional capital contributions to the Company, unless such is (i) required in writing by the Bank’s
	federal or state regulators or (ii) approved in writing by a Super Majority Consent of the Members. In the event that additional
	capital contributions to the Company are required or approved pursuant to this

	Article III

	,

	Section 1

	, the Bank
	shall contribute the first four million dollars ($4,000,000) (the

	“Bank Additional Capital Contribution”

	),
	provided, however, that any Bank Additional Capital Contribution shall not result in the issuance of additional membership interests
	in the Company or be taken into account in any adjustment of the Members’ respective percentage membership interests and
	it shall have no adverse tax consequences to or upon the Minority Members. Additional capital contributions in excess of the Bank
	Additional Capital Contribution shall be made by the Members in proportion to each Member’s proportional membership interest
	immediately preceding such additional capital contributions in order that each Minority Member shall maintain his, her or its
	respective ownership of the Company, and any additional capital contributions pursuant to this

	Article III

	,

	Section
	1

	would not dilute the membership interests of the Minority Members immediately preceding additional capital contributions.


	 


	Absent a Super Majority
	Consent of the Members, no Member shall be entitled to withdraw any part of such Member’s capital contributions to the Company,
	except as provided in

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	;

	Article V

	and

	Article XII

	. No Member shall be entitled
	to demand or receive any Property from the Company other than cash, except as otherwise expressly provided for herein.


	 




	Section 2.          Capital
	Accounts.




	 


	There shall be established
	on the books of the Company a capital account for each Member (“

	Capital Account(s)

	”). It is the intention of
	the Members that such Capital Account be maintained in accordance with GAAP, and this Agreement shall be so construed. Accordingly,
	the agreed value of the initial Capital Account contribution of each Member shall be credited to such Member’s Capital Account.
	Each Member’s Capital Account shall be: (a)

	increased

	by (i) any cash or the fair market value of any additional
	property contributed by such Member (net of any liabilities assumed by the Company or to which the contributed property is subject),
	and (ii) the amount of all net income (whether or not exempt from tax) allocated to such Member in accordance with

	Article
	VI

	,

	Section 3

	; and (b)

	decreased

	by (i) the amount of all net losses allocated to such Member in accordance
	with

	Article VI

	,

	Section 3

	, and (ii) the amount of cash, and the fair market value of Property (net of any liabilities
	assumed by such Member or to which the distributed Property is subject) distributed to such Member in accordance with

	Article
	III

	,

	Section 3

	or

	Article XII

	,

	Section 4

	.

	If any, but not all,
	of the Members transfer all or any portion of their respective membership interests in accordance with

	Article V

	,

	Section
	1

	, hereof, then the Capital Account of the transferor Member shall become the Capital Account of the transferee to the extent
	of the membership interest transferred.


	 


	The foregoing provisions
	of this

	Article III

	,

	Section 2

	and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of capital
	accounts are intended to comply with GAAP, and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with GAAP.



	 





	Section 3.          Distributions.




	 


	The declaration and
	payment of any distributions, other than those specifically provided for in this Agreement, shall be as permitted by law, consistent
	with the Company’s obligations to its creditors, made from cash available for distribution from the Company, subject to
	the receipt of any required regulatory approval (if needed) and subject to the Super Majority Consent of the Board, which shall
	not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.


	 


	Except as otherwise
	provided in this Agreement, any distributions shall be allocated in proportion to each Member’s proportional membership
	interest in the Company and not in proportion to each Member’s Capital Account balance.


	 


	To the extent permitted
	by law, consistent with the Company’s obligations to its creditors, the Board shall approve and the Company shall make Tax
	Distributions on or before January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each Fiscal Year (the “

	Tax Distribution Dates

	”)
	and as provided in the fourth paragraph of this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	. The aggregate amount of the distributions
	made to Members with respect to any given Tax Distribution Date shall be the product of (i) the Company’s estimated federal
	taxable income under the provisions of the Code for the Fiscal Period ending on the last day of the calendar month immediately
	preceding the Tax Distribution Date and commencing on the first day of the calendar month that includes the immediately previous
	Tax Distribution Date, multiplied by (ii) the applicable Tax Rate (

	“Tax Distribution(s)”

	). Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, to the extent the Company has had an estimated federal taxable loss for any prior Fiscal Period in that Fiscal
	Year, the Tax Distributions shall be reduced by that portion of the loss remaining after reducing taxable income for prior Fiscal
	Periods in the Fiscal Year for the loss. Each Member shall receive a Tax Distribution proportional to the amount of federal taxable
	income to be allocated to the Member in accordance with

	Article VI

	and

	Article VIII

	.


	 






	 



	11



	 







	 




	 


	If any income tax
	return of the Company, as a result of an audit or otherwise, reflects items of income, gain, loss, or deduction that are different
	than the amounts estimated in accordance with the third paragraph of this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	, with respect to
	a Fiscal Year in a manner that results in additional income or gain of the Company being allocated to the Members, an additional
	Tax Distribution shall be made under the principles of the third paragraph of this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	to the
	Members (or former Members) who are allocated the additional income or gain, except that (i) the last day of the calendar month
	in which the adjustment occurs shall be treated as a tax distribution date, and (ii) the amount of the additional income or gain
	shall be treated as the Company’s federal taxable income.


	 


	Any Member may, in
	its sole discretion, waive receipt of its portion of any Tax Distributions pursuant to this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	.
	Any such waiver shall not affect such Member’s membership interest in the Company in any way.


	 


	Each Member acknowledges
	and agrees that the Company may reduce the amount of any distributions pursuant to this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	to
	such Member by any amount owed by such Member to the Company. The Members agree that payments of any offset amount in accordance
	with this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	shall be deemed to have been distributed to such Member for all purposes of this
	Agreement and then paid by such Member to the Company.


	 


	Notwithstanding any
	provision in this Agreement requiring otherwise, except provisions in this seventh and the eighth paragraph of this

	Article
	III

	,

	Section 3

	, at any time subsequent to September 30, 2020, each Minority Member shall have the right, but not the
	obligation, in his or her sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the receipt of any required regulatory approval (if needed),
	to require the Board to declare and make distributions from the Company to such Minority Member in full or partial amount, at
	any time, up to and not exceeding one (1.0) times such Minority Member’s Capital Account balance at the month end immediately
	preceding the date of distribution (the “

	Distribution Right

	”).


	 


	If a Minority Member
	elects to exercise the Distribution Right, such Minority Member must notify the Secretary of the Board of his or her election
	in accordance with

	Article XVI

	,

	Section 12

	, not less than ten (10) business days prior to the Board’s next
	regularly scheduled meeting, and set forth a reasonably detailed explanation of the estimated distribution amount for such Minority
	Member (the “

	Distribution Right Notice

	”). The Company shall have thirty (30) days from the declaration of the
	distribution, which shall occur at the first regularly scheduled Board meeting following timely receipt of the Distribution Right
	Notice, to make such distribution. In the event that distributions pursuant to the seventh and this eighth paragraph of this

	Article
	III

	,

	Section 3

	occur, the Bank shall be wholly responsible for recapitalizing the Company as may be required by the
	Board, the Bank’s board of directors or the Bank’s federal or state regulators. In the event that a Change in Control
	Notice has been delivered to the Limited Members pursuant to

	Article V

	,

	Section 5

	the provisions of this

	Article
	III

	,

	Section 3

	regarding such shall be deemed void and unenforceable on their terms until such time it is determined
	that a Change in Control as contemplated in such Change in Control Notice shall not occur.


	 






	 



	12



	 







	 




	 


	In the event of a
	Change in Control where the Minority Members retain membership interests in the Company following the Change in Control, for a
	period of one hundred and eighty (180) days subsequent to the closing of the Change in Control (the

	“Change in Control
	Distribution Period”

	), the Limited Members shall have the right, but not the obligation, in their sole and absolute
	discretion, subject only to unanimous consent of the Limited Members and the receipt of any required regulatory approval (if needed),
	to require the Board to declare and make distributions from the Company to each, but not less than all, the Minority Members equal
	to one (1.0) times the balance of each Minority Member’s Capital Account at the month end immediately preceding the date
	of distribution (collectively, the “

	Change in Control


	Distribution Right

	”).


	 


	If the Limited Members
	elect to exercise the Change in Control Distribution Right, the Limited Members must notify the Secretary of the Board of such
	election in accordance with

	Article XVI

	,

	Section 12

	, during the Change in Control Distribution Period and not less
	than ten (10) business days prior to the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting, and must set for a reasonably detailed
	explanation of the estimated distribution amount for each Minority Member (the

	“Change in Control Distribution Notice”

	).
	The Company shall have thirty (30) days from the declaration of the distribution, which shall occur at the first regularly scheduled
	Board meeting following timely receipt of the Change in Control Distribution Notice, to make such distribution. In the event that
	distributions pursuant to the ninth and this tenth paragraph of this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	occur, the successor
	of the Bank shall be wholly responsible for recapitalizing the Company as may be required by the Board, the successor bank’s
	board of directors or the successor bank’s federal or state regulators. After expiration of the Change in Control Distribution
	Period, unless exercised by the Limited Members in accordance with this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	, the Change in Control
	Distribution Right shall expire and the provisions of this

	Article III

	,

	Section 3

	regarding such shall be deemed
	void and unenforceable on their terms.


	 



	ARTICLE IV –
	ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS



	 


	Subject to approval
	of the Board, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Limited Members may admit additional members
	to the Company as they deem appropriate, provided, however, that such additional members must be active employees, officers or
	Limited Member Managers, other than the Limited Members, of the Company. If the Limited Members determine to admit additional
	members to the Company, such additional members shall be bound by this Agreement, any of the provisions of which may be amended
	or modified to take into account such additional members as agreed by the Limited Members and the additional members. The addition
	of an additional member shall not reduce the Bank’s membership interest in the Company in any way.


	 



	ARTICLE V –
	TRANSFER OR DISPOSITION OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS;




	SALE OR DISPOSITION
	OF THE COMPANY



	 




	Section 1.          Permitted
	Transfers by Limited Members.




	 


	With the prior consent
	of the Bank, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, a Limited Member may transfer all or part of his
	membership interest to trusts, immediate family members, or other related Persons controlled by a Limited Member, provided that
	the transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the same restrictions as the Limited Member.


	 






	 



	13



	 







	 




	 


	The Limited Members
	may transfer up to, but not to exceed, ten percent (10%) of their membership interests to certain members of the Company’s
	management team and Limited Member Managers that are admitted as additional Members in accordance with

	Article IV

	.


	 




	Section 2.          Bank’s
	Call Right.




	 


	Beginning on July
	1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2020 (the “

	Call Period

	”), the Bank shall have the option, but not the obligation,
	to purchase all (but not less than all) of the membership interests of the Minority Members, at a price (for each Minority Member)
	equal to one (1.0) times any Tax Distributions that were previously waived by each Minority Member and any additional capital
	contributions made by the Minority Members in accordance with

	Article III

	,

	Section 1

	, and one and a half (1.5) times
	the balance of each Minority Member’s Capital Account (less any aforementioned previously waived Tax Distributions and additional
	capital contributions), which shall be paid by the Company to the Minority Member(s) at time of Closing (collectively, the “

	Call
	Right

	”).


	 


	If the Bank elects
	to exercise the Call Right, the Bank must notify the affected Minority Members of such election in accordance with

	Article
	XVI

	,

	Section 12

	and must set forth (i) the membership interest of each Minority Member (not less than all Minority
	Members) being purchased by the Bank, (ii) the anticipated date of Closing, and (iii) a reasonably detailed explanation of the
	estimated purchase price calculation (the “

	Call Right Notice

	”). Closing shall be as soon as administratively
	possible following September 30, 2020 and no later than December 31, 2020, provided, however, that the Bank shall receive and
	the Minority Members shall reasonably provide the Bank a delay of Closing not to exceed February 28, 2021 should the Bank, acting
	in good faith, encounter delays in Closing that are beyond the Bank’s control. Notwithstanding the above, Closing may be
	extended beyond February 28, 2021 by a Super Majority Consent of the Members. The Bank shall pay cash to the Minority Members
	for the purchase, unless the parties agree otherwise to settle the Call Right (partially or in full) in shares of common stock
	of FSFG, which shall be in writing.


	 


	If the parties agree
	that the purchase will entail common stock of FSFG, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the closing price as
	reported on the national securities exchange on which the shares are traded. If the shares of FSFG common stock are not traded
	on a national securities exchange, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the average of the closing bid and ask
	prices as quoted on a national quotation system or, if such quotations are unavailable, as determined by an independent third
	party as agreed to by a Super Majority Consent of the Members.


	 


	Within thirty (30)
	days of receipt of the Call Right Notice, each of the Minority Members shall furnish to the Bank instructions for remitting payment
	at Closing. Any cash payment shall be satisfied by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account(s) and any
	stock payment shall be satisfied by the electronic delivery of FSFG common stock to the brokerage account(s) specified by each
	Minority Member in response to the Call Right Notice. After expiration of the Call Period, unless exercised by the Bank in accordance
	with this

	Article V

	,

	Section 2

	, the Call Right shall expire and the provisions of this

	Article V

	,

	Section
	2

	shall be deemed void and unenforceable on their terms.

	Section 3.          Minority
	Members’ Options and Other Rights.




	 


	At any time from the
	expiration of the Call Right through December 31, 2021 (the “

	Company Sale Option Period

	”) and subject to the
	receipt of any required regulatory approval (if needed), the Limited Members shall have the option, subject to unanimous consent
	of the Limited Members, but not the obligation, to market for sale of 100% of the membership interests of the Company to any other
	Persons permitted in this

	Article V

	,

	Section 3

	at a price of not less than one and a half (1.5) times the collective
	balance of all Capital Accounts of the Members, which shall be paid to the Members at Closing (collectively, the “

	Company
	Sale Right

	”). The Limited Members may exercise the Company Sale Right with respect to any Persons except Financial Institutions
	residing within a twenty-five (25) mile radius of any office of the Bank or FSFG located within the State of Indiana at September
	30, 2020, provided, however, that the offices of the Bank or FSFG shall not mean to include offices of the Company.


	 


	If the Limited Members
	elect to exercise the Company Sale Right, the Limited Members must notify the Bank in accordance with

	Article XVI

	,

	Section
	12

	prior to engaging in conversations with any Person(s) for the purpose of marketing the membership interests of the Company
	(the

	“Company Sale Right Notice”)

	and shall abide by the provisions of

	Article XIV

	with respect to any
	conversations with any Person(s). Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Company Sale Right Notice, the Bank and Limited Members
	shall collectively engage an investment banker or other professional, which shall be selected by a Super Majority Consent of the
	Members, for the purpose of marketing the Company for sale. Closing shall be as soon as administratively possible following September
	30, 2020 and no later than June 30, 2022. Notwithstanding the above, Closing may be extended beyond June 30, 2022 by a Super Majority
	Consent of the Members. No Member(s) shall share disproportionately in the premium paid by the purchaser for each Member’s
	Capital Account. Each Member may elect to receive differing forms of consideration offered by the purchaser for the consummation
	of the sale of the Company; however, the form of aggregate consideration to be received shall be agreed upon by Super Majority
	Consent of the Members, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.


	 


	Notwithstanding the
	above, in the event that a Change in Control Notice has been delivered to the Limited Members pursuant to

	Article V

	,

	Section
	5

	, the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of this

	Article V

	,

	Section 3

	shall be deemed void and unenforceable
	on their terms. After expiration of the Company Sale Option Period, unless a definitive agreement for sale of the Company has
	been executed in such period, the Company Sale Right shall expire and the provisions of this

	Article V

	,

	Section 3

	shall be deemed void and unenforceable on their terms. Each party shall act in good faith in compliance with the provisions and
	requirements as set forth in this

	Article V

	,

	Section 3

	.

	Notwithstanding the
	above provisions of this

	Article V

	,

	Section 3

	, each Minority Member may offer to sell all or a portion of his or
	her membership interests to only the Bank at any time prior to October 1, 2020 at a price to be mutually agreed to in writing
	by the parties (the

	“Minority Member Sale Offer”

	). The selling Minority Member must notify the Bank of his
	or her offer to sell the membership interest(s) in accordance with

	Article XVI

	,

	Section 12

	and must set forth (i)
	the membership interests to be sold by the Minority Member, (ii) a preferred date of Closing, and (iii) a reasonably detailed
	explanation of the sale price calculation and preferred form of consideration to be received (the

	“Minority Member Sale
	Offer Notice”

	). The Bank, in its sole discretion and subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approval (if
	needed), may accept or decline the offer. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Minority Member Sale Offer Notice, the Bank
	shall respond in writing to accept, decline or negotiate the terms of the Minority Member Sale Offer Notice and to establish Closing,
	which shall not be later than sixty (60) days from the Bank’s written acceptance of the Minority Member Sale Offer. If no
	written notice of acceptance by the Bank is provided to the selling Minority Member, then the absence of such shall be deemed
	as a decline. If the Bank elects to accept the Minority Member Sale Offer, it shall pay cash to the Minority Member for the purchase,
	unless the parties agree otherwise to settle the Minority Member Sale Offer (partially or fully) in shares of common stock of
	FSFG, which shall be in writing.


	 


	If the parties agree
	that the purchase will entail common stock of FSFG, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the closing price as
	reported on the national securities exchange on which the shares are traded. If the shares of FSFG common stock are not traded
	on a national securities exchange, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the average of the closing bid and ask
	prices as quoted on a national quotation system or, if such quotations are unavailable, as determined by an independent third
	party as mutually agreed by the selling Minority Member and Bank.


	 


	Within thirty (30)
	days of Closing, the selling Minority Member shall furnish to the Bank instructions for remitting payment at Closing. Any cash
	payment shall be satisfied by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account(s) and any stock payment shall
	be satisfied by the electronic delivery of FSFG common stock to the brokerage account(s) specified by the selling Minority Member.
	If the Bank elects to decline the Minority Member Sale Option for any reason, the Minority Member may only sell his or her membership
	interest in accordance with this

	Article V

	,

	Sections 2, 3, 4, 5

	and

	6

	.


	 




	Section 4.          Transfers
	upon Termination of Service With Cause or Without Good Reason.




	 


	Notwithstanding the
	provisions of

	Article V

	,

	Section 3

	, if a Minority Member other than a Limited Member affiliated with the Company
	or the Bank other than in his or her membership interest in the Company, whether an officer, employee or Manager, is terminated
	or terminates such affiliation with the Company or Bank for any reason, or if a Limited Member affiliated with Bank as an officer
	or employee is terminated or terminates such affiliation with the Bank due to an “Involuntary Termination With Cause”
	or a “Voluntary Termination Without Good Reason” as defined in the Employment Agreements between such Limited Member
	and the Bank, any time before October 1, 2020 (in all cases,

	“Termination”

	), such Minority Member (including
	a Limited Member) shall offer his or her membership interest for sale at a price equal to one (1.0) times the balance of his or
	her Minority Member’s Capital Account balance at the date of Termination (the

	“Termination Sale Offer”

	).
	The Limited Members then affiliated with the Company shall have the first option to accept the Termination Sale Offer, followed
	by the Bank (second option) and then followed by other Minority Members then affiliated with the Company as an officer or employee
	(third option).


	 






	 



	16



	 







	 




	 


	Within sixty (60)
	days of Termination, the eligible Limited Members shall respond in writing to accept or decline the Termination Sale Offer. The
	Bank shall have the lesser of sixty (60) days from the date the Limited Members decline the Termination Sale Offer or one hundred
	and twenty (120) days from the date of Termination to respond in writing to accept or decline the Termination Sale Offer. The
	eligible Minority Members shall have the lesser of sixty (60) days from the date the Bank declines the Termination Sale Offer
	or one hundred and twenty (180) days from the date of Termination to respond in writing to accept or decline the Termination Sale
	Offer. Closing shall be established in any written acceptance of the Termination Sale Offer and shall not be later than sixty
	(60) days from the written acceptance of the Termination Sale Offer. If no written notice of acceptance is provided to the selling
	Minority Member prior to the expiration of each period set forth above in this paragraph, then the absence of such shall be deemed
	as a decline as of the expiration of each period set forth above in this paragraph. If the Termination Sale Offer is accepted,
	the purchaser shall pay cash to the Minority Member for the purchase, unless the Bank is the purchaser and the selling Minority
	Member and Bank agree otherwise to settle the Termination Sale Offer (partially or fully) in shares of common stock of FSFG, which
	shall be in writing.


	 


	If the parties agree
	that the purchase will entail common stock of FSFG, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the closing price as
	reported on the national securities exchange on which the shares are traded. If the shares of FSFG common stock are not traded
	on a national securities exchange, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the average of the closing bid and ask
	prices as quoted on a national quotation system or, if such quotations are unavailable, as determined by an independent third
	party as mutually agreed by the selling Minority Member and Bank.


	 


	Within thirty (30)
	days of Closing, the selling Minority Member shall furnish to the purchaser instructions for remitting payment at Closing. Any
	cash payment shall be satisfied by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account(s) and any stock payment shall
	be satisfied by the electronic delivery of FSFG common stock to the brokerage account(s) specified by the selling Minority Member.
	If the Termination Sale Offer is not accepted by the eligible Limited Members, the Bank or eligible Minority Members, then the
	terminated Minority Member may only sell his or her membership interest in accordance with

	Article V

	,

	Sections 2, 3,
	4, 5

	and

	6

	.


	 


	In the event Termination
	occurs as a result of Sections 3.2(8) or (9) of the Employment Agreements, the provisions of this

	Article V

	,

	Section
	4

	shall be deemed void and unenforceable on their terms.

	is terminated or terminates such affiliation with the Bank due to an “Involuntary Termination Without Cause” or a
	“Voluntary Termination With Good Reason”, as defined in the Employment Agreements between such Limited Member and
	the Bank, any time before October 1, 2020 (in either case, an

	“Involuntary Termination”

	), such Limited Member
	may offer his or her membership interest for sale to the Bank at a price equal to one and a half (1.5) times the balance of his
	or her Limited Member’s Capital Account balance at the date the Involuntary Termination (the

	“Involuntary Termination
	Sale Offer”

	). Upon receipt of the Involuntary Termination Sale Offer, the Bank shall be obligated, subject to the receipt
	of any required regulatory approval (if needed), to accept the offer and shall respond in writing to establish Closing, which
	shall not be later than sixty (60) days from the Bank’s receipt of the Involuntary Termination Sale Offer. The Bank shall
	pay cash to the Limited Member for the purchase, unless the parties agree otherwise to settle the Involuntary Termination Sale
	Offer (partially or fully) in shares of common stock of FSFG, which shall be in writing.


	 


	If the parties agree
	that the purchase will entail common stock of FSFG, the value of a share of FSFG common stock shall equal the closing price as

	Article
	V

	,

	Section 5

	in Control.




	 


	In the event the Bank
	or FSFG engage an investment banker to represent the sale of the Bank or FSFG prior to October 1, 2020, the Bank shall notify
	the Limited Members, within thirty (30) days of such engagement, in accordance with

	the sale of the Minority Members’ membership interests, provided, however, that the potentially acquiring Person(s) (once
	selected by the Bank or FSFG) has desire to engage in discussions with the Limited Members for such purpose. The decision to have
	such discussions with the engaged investment banker and potentially acquiring Person(s) for the stated purpose shall be at the
	Limited Members’ sole and absolute discretion, subject only to unanimous consent of the Limited Members and the desire of
	the potentially acquiring Person(s). The Limited Members shall have the sole and absolute discretion, subject only to unanimous
	consent of the Limited Members, to offer for sale all Minority Members’ membership interests to a potentially acquiring

	The business and affairs
	of the Company shall be managed exclusively by the Board. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, the Board
	shall have full, exclusive and complete discretion, power and authority, subject in all cases to the provisions of this Agreement
	and the requirements of applicable law, to manage, control, administer and operate the business and affairs of the Company for
	the purposes herein stated, to make all decisions affecting such business and affairs, to act for and on behalf of the Company,
	to bind the Company, to adopt such accounting rules and procedures as it deems appropriate in the conduct of the business and
	affairs of the Company and to do all things it deems necessary or desirable in the conduct of the business and affairs of the
	Company. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Board may appoint and delegate the day-to-day management and direction
	of the business responsibilities to Managers, officer and other agents of the Company as it deems appropriate in its sole and
	absolute discretion. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement or any mandatory provision of the Act, the affirmative
	vote, approval or consent of the Managers representing a Majority in Interest shall be required to decide any matter that requires
	the approval of the Board.


	 




	Section 2.          Composition
	of the Board; Vacancies; Removal.




	 


	The Company’s
	board of managers shall be comprised of seven (7) members (each, individually, a “

	Manager

	”, and collectively,
	the “

	Board

	”), the “

	Initial Managers

	” being listed on

	Exhibit A

	hereto, which is incorporated
	herein by reference in this Agreement, unless changed in accordance with this Agreement. Each Manager shall hold office until
	such Manager resigns, retires, dies or is removed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. With respect to the Initial
	Managers, for purposes of this

	Article IX

	,

	Section 2

	, the Bank’s Managers listed on

	Exhibit A

	shall
	be deemed the “

	Bank Managers

	” and the Limited Member’s Managers listed on

	Exhibit A

	shall be deemed
	the “

	Limited Member Managers

	”.


	 


	Subject to this

	Article
	IX

	,

	Section 2

	and as set forth below, the Bank Managers shall have the right to appoint four (4) Managers or a successor
	for any such designated Bank Manager to be determined by the Bank. The Bank Managers, which shall include at least one non-employee
	director of the Bank or FSFG, must exceed the Limited Member Managers by at least one (1) member at all times. The Limited Members
	shall have the right to appoint three (3) Managers or a successor for any such designated Limited Member Manager to be determined
	unanimously by the Limited Members. The Limited Member’s representation on the Board shall include the Limited Members during
	the period that each is affiliated with the Company as an officer, employee or owner of membership interest in the Company. If
	any of the aforementioned Bank Managers or Limited Member Managers cease to act as a Manager for any reason, such Manager’s
	replacement as a Manager shall be appointed by whichever Manager group (the Bank Managers or Limited Member Managers, respectively)
	that appointed the Manager being replaced. Any appointment of a Manager by either of the Bank Managers or Limited Member Managers
	shall be subject to the approval of the other Manager group (the Bank Managers or Limited Member Managers, respectively), provided
	that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.


	 






	 



	22



	 







	 




	 


	In the event that
	the size of the Board is increased, in accordance with this Agreement, such additional Managers shall be appointed by the Bank
	Managers, the Limited Member Managers, or both, in accordance with this

	Article IX

	,

	Section 2

	, such that Bank Managers
	exceed the Limited Member Managers by at least one (1) member.


	 


	The Bank Managers
	and Limited Member Managers may each remove and immediately replace a Manager within their respective groups, with or without
	cause, at any time by written notice to such Manager and the other Managers, with the successor of such Manager specified in such
	notice (subject to and in accordance with each of the provisions set forth above in this

	Article IX

	,

	Section 2

	,
	including, but not limited to, that only each of the Bank Managers and Limited Member Managers, respectively, may replace one
	of their own Managers). The removal of a Manager by either of the Bank Managers or Limited Member Managers, shall be subject to
	the approval of the other Manager group (the Bank Managers or Limited Member Managers, respectively), provided that such approval
	shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.


	 


	Each Manager (when
	acting in the capacity of Manager) shall be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses, including travel and lodging, in connection
	with the performance of their duties and obligations hereunder, provided, however, that prior approval for such expenses is granted
	by the Board. Each Manager (when acting in the capacity of Manager) shall be entitled to receive any fees for services rendered
	on behalf of the Company in an amount determined by the Board.

	Managers of the Board
	may participate in a meeting of the Board by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which
	all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in
	person at such meeting. Participation in a meeting by such means shall constitute presence in person at meeting.

	ARTICLE XI – OPERATING MATTERS



	 




	Section 1.          Borrowings.




	 


	The Company shall
	have the right to borrow funds from the Bank, subject to the prior approval by the Bank. The Company shall also have the right
	to borrower funds from other third parties as determined by a Super Majority Consent of the Board, which shall not be unreasonably
	withheld, conditioned or delayed, subject to the prior approval by the Bank. Borrowings by the Company shall not dilute any Member’s
	respective membership interest in the Company.


	 




	Section 2.          Borrowings
	from the Bank.




	 


	Any borrowings by
	the Company from the Bank shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to two hundred (200) basis points below the prime lending
	rate as published from time-to-time in

	The Wall Street Journal

	, provided, however, that if the Company’s capital
	leverage (defined as the quotient equal to total equity of the Company on the first day of each month divided by the net loans
	in excess of forty million dollars ($40,000,000) (after loss provisions) of the Company on any given day during said month) is
	less than ten percent (10%) for a period exceeding ninety (90) days, the annual interest rate shall increase to two hundred (200)
	basis points above such prime lending rate, but such increased rate shall only apply to such amount that the Company’s capital
	leverage is less than ten percent (10%) for such period (as opposed to the entire leveraged amount).



	 





	Section 3.          Deposits.




	 


	The Company shall
	maintain all of its deposit accounts with the Bank at all times.


	 




	Section 4.          Annual
	Budget.




	 


	Prior to April 30,
	2016, the Bank and Limited Members, with the assistance of the Board, any of the Company’s officers, employees and financial
	consultants, shall have approved of an annual operating budget of the Company (the “

	Initial Annual Budget

	”).
	Within thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of each Fiscal Year beginning after the Effective Date, the Chief Executive Officer,
	with the assistance of the Company’s officers and financial consultants, shall present to the Board an annual operating
	budget (an “

	Annual Budget

	”), which shall be approved by the Board.


	 




	Section 5.          Leased
	Employees.




	 


	The Company shall
	have no employees and, thus, the human resource needs of the Company shall be met by way of leased employees from the Bank or
	an Affiliate thereof, in accordance with the Employee Lease Agreement, as amended from time to time, a copy of which is attached
	as

	Exhibit B

	Section 6.          Intercompany
	Reimbursements.




	 


	The Company shall
	make appropriate monthly provisions to reimburse the Bank, promptly upon receipt of written invoice from the Bank, for reasonable
	expenses relating to various administrative support functions provided by the Bank to the Company, including, without limitation,
	payroll processing, accounting services, human resource administration, technology costs, use of Bank-owned office space, and
	overhead (the

	“Monthly Overhead”

	). Prior to the end of the first month of a given Fiscal Year, the Bank and
	the Board, with a Super Majority Consent of the Board, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall
	agree upon the Monthly Overhead for such Fiscal Year, provided, however, that either the Bank or Company may request the Monthly
	Overhead be reconsidered at the end of the mid-point of a given Fiscal Year if substantial changes in services or expenses has
	occurred or shall occur during such Fiscal Year. In the event that the Bank and Company cannot agree upon the Monthly Overhead,
	the Bank shall provide documentation setting forth and substantiating the expenses, with sufficient supporting detail, including,
	but not limited to, workpapers setting forth the details of the Bank’s calculation of such amounts, including details of
	any applicable overhead percentages, rates and provisions for allocation. The Monthly Overhead shall be subject to at least an
	annual review of the Board.


	 


	The monthly payment
	amounts for Monthly Overhead shall be reduced by any earnings credit related to loans originated and owned by the Bank or its
	Affiliates (other than the Company) as a result of the efforts of the Company, which shall generally be the interest income earned
	on such loans for a given month. Conversely, the monthly payment amounts for the Monthly Overhead shall be increased by any earnings
	credit related to loans originated and owned by the Company as a result of the efforts of the Bank or its Affiliates (other than
	the Company), which shall generally be the interest income earned on such loans for a given month. The monthly payment amounts
	for Monthly Overhead may also be reduced or increased for any nonrecurring items of income or expense that are recognized or incurred
	by the Bank or the Company on behalf of the other, including, but not limited to professional fees, equipment purchases, maintenance
	and special project costs.


	 




	Section 7.          Defined
	Credit Policy for the Company.




	 


	The Company shall
	have a separately defined credit policy and credit guidelines from those of the Bank, which shall be approved by the Board, and
	which shall be incorporated into the Bank’s comprehensive credit policy, at the Bank’s sole and absolute discretion.


	 


	For the purpose of
	this Agreement, the

	“Initial Credit Guidelines”

	shall include, but not be limited to, (i) credit approval authority
	for each underwriter of the Company of up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) for the gross origination amount for each SBA 7(a)
	program loan; (ii) approval by the Bank’s SBA loan committee for each SBA 7(a) program loan whose gross origination amount
	exceeds two million dollars ($2,000,000). All loans generated by the Company that are not SBA 7(a) program loans, which shall
	only be permitted to be originated by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, shall require approval
	based upon the Bank’s credit policy and written procedures. The Bank’s SBA loan committee shall include, but not be
	limited to, certain officers of the Bank and Company, as determined by the Bank, but at all times shall include the CEO and President
	of the Company.

	Section 8.          Significant
	Impairment of the Business Model.




	 


	The Bank recognizes
	the Company’s intended primary source of borrowings is the Bank pursuant to

	Article XI

	,

	Sections 1

	and

	2,

	and acknowledges the intended credit policy and guidelines for the Company pursuant to

	Article XI

	,

	Section 7

	.
	The initial business plan of the Company projects the origination of approximately five hundred five million dollars ($505,000,000)
	of SBA 7(a) program loans (gross) during the first sixty-three (63) months beginning on July 1, 2015 and ending on September 30,
	2020 based on the following projected gross originations by period:


	 




	 



	·



	Months


	1 – 15


	(ending September 30, 2016)


	$45,000,000




	 



	·



	Months


	16 – 27


	(ending September 30, 2017)


	$90,000,000




	 



	·



	Months


	28 – 39


	(ending September 30, 2018)


	$105,000,000

	$120,000,000




	 



	·



	Months


	52 – 63


	(ending September 30, 2020)


	$145,000,000




	 


	Additionally, the
	initial business plan of the Company projects total assets of approximately one hundred forty-six million dollars ($146,000,000)
	on September 30, 2020.


	 


	It is the goal of
	the Bank to support the growth of the Company to these levels in a manner that does not impede or infringe upon the Bank’s
	mission, operations, liquidity, capital, asset quality, financial performance, and safety and soundness, among other performance
	and risk considerations. However, the Company acknowledges that factors and conditions both within and beyond the Bank’s
	control may affect the Bank’s ability and desire to support the Company as originally contemplated.


	 


	In the event that
	the Bank causes Significant Impairment to the Company’s business model with respect to its ability to borrow or the Initial
	Credit Guidelines, the Limited Members shall only have the option, but not the obligation, to exercise the Company Sale Right
	as set forth in and in accordance with

	,

	Section 3

	, subject to the following provisions and curative remedies
	in this

	Article XI

	,

	Section 8

	. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Limited Members shall have no other
	rights or remedies, take action against the Bank or its Affiliates, or have other recourse against the Bank or its Affiliates
	in the event of a Significant Impairment.

	,

	measured at each calendar quarter end within
	each stated period (each period divided by four (4)) and cumulatively for all calendar
	quarters and periods in succession), provided, however, that the Bank may remedy the
	aforementioned borrowing impairment prior to the end of the quarter subsequent to the
	quarter for which the impairment occurred. Should such a borrowing impairment occur,
	a curative remedy for the impairment shall include the arrangement of alternative sources
	of borrowings by the Company or Bank in amounts necessary to support the intended growth
	of the Company within five percent (5%) of the levels outlined in this

	Article XI

	,

	that the Bank may remedy the aforementioned credit guidelines impairment should such
	impairment be otherwise deemed to be without Good Reason, within thirty (30) days of
	the determination of the impairment as without Good Reason.




	 


	For the purpose of
	this

	Article XI

	,

	Section 8


	“Good Reason”

	for the Bank’s implementation of more conservative
	lending guidelines includes, but is not limited to, the requirement or recommendation by a regulator of the Bank or the Company
	to implement credit standards or guidelines more stringent than the Initial Credit Guidelines, and/or the deterioration in asset
	quality of the Company that results in the following:


	 






	(a)


	As measured at a given calendar
	quarter end: (i) a ratio of Nonperforming Loans to Total Loans of five percent (5.00%)
	or higher, (ii) a ratio of Nonperforming Loans to Total Loans for a portfolio of loans
	approved by a particular underwriter of three and a half percent (3.50%) or higher (in

	ended at which the measurement is made: (v) a ratio of Net Charge-Offs to Average Loans
	of three percent (3.00%) or higher, provided, however, that no action will be taken by
	the Bank if the noncompliance with the aforementioned is remedied prior to the end of
	the subsequent quarter end, which shall then be for an annualized period of four (4)
	consecutive quarters including the subsequent quarter ended at which the measurement
	is made.




	 






	(c)


	As measured at a given calendar
	quarter end cumulatively for a period of four (4) consecutive quarters: (vi) denials
	or repairs of SBA guarantees resulting in losses to the Company totaling one hundred

	for which impairment occurred, and (ii) a reasonably detailed explanation of the impairment (the

	“Impairment Notice”

	).
	The absence of notification by an Impairment Notice for any given quarter within the stated ten (10) business day period shall
	evidence that a Significant Impairment did not occur for such quarter and shall cause this

	Article XI

	,

	Section 8

	to be void and unenforceable on its terms for that particular quarter.


	 


	In the event of a

	Sale Option Period and Closing shall not be binding for the purpose of this

	Article XI

	in the event there are insufficient
	funds to completely satisfy each Member’s additional Capital Account contributions);




	 






	(g)


	seventh, to each of the Members
	in the amount up to but not exceeding each Member’s Capital Account (any payment
	made under this Subsection (f) shall be made

	pro rata

	in the event there are insufficient

	Account and its share of profits and losses, and shall have no recourse therefor (upon dissolution or otherwise) against any other
	Member. Accordingly, if such Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions
	and allocations for all Fiscal Years, including the year during which the liquidation occurs), then such Member shall have no

	EXHIBIT B




	EMPLOYEE LEASE AGREEMENT




	 



	THIS

	EMPLOYEE LEASE
	AGREEMENT

	(“Agreement”) is made effective as of the 1st day of January, 2017 (the “Effective Date”),
	by and between

	FIRST SAVINGS BANK

	, an Indiana-chartered commercial bank, having its principal office at 501 East Lewis &
	Clark Parkway, Clarksville, Indiana 47129


	(“Lessor”) and

	Q2 BUSINESS CAPITAL, LLC

	, an Indiana limited
	liability company, having its principal office at 501 E. Lewis & Clark Parkway, Clarksville, Indiana 47129 (“Lessee”).
	Lessor and Lessee will be referred to herein individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties.”


	 



	WHEREAS

	, prior
	to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Lessor entered into an Operating Agreement with Lessee (the “Q2 Operating
	Agreement”) whereby Lessor owns 51% of the outstanding membership interests in Lessee;



	 




	WHEREAS

	, pursuant
	to the terms of the Q2 Operating Agreement, Lessee shall have no employees and, thus, the human resource needs of the Lessee shall
	be met by way of leased employees from the Lessor or an affiliate thereof, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;


	 



	WHEREAS,

	Lessee
	now desires to lease from Lessor, and Lessor desires to lease to Lessee, certain of Lessor’s employees, on the terms and
	conditions set forth in this Agreement. A list of leased employees as of the date of this Agreement is identified on Schedule A,
	as may amended, (the “Leased Employees”) and is subject to amendment throughout the term of this Agreement by written
	mutual consent of the Parties.


	 



	NOW, THEREFORE,

	in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual promises set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,
	the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:


	 



	1.          

	Lease
	of Employees.


	Lessor agrees to lease to Lessee, and Lessee agrees to lease from Lessor, the Leased Employees as required
	for operation of its business commencing on the Effective Date and continuing until termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
	4. The number of Leased Employees required and the qualifications and skills required by those Leased Employees will be determined
	by Lessee and may be modified from time to time.



	 




	2.          

	Payment
	of Employee Compensation and Benefits

	.

	As the employer of the Leased Employees, Lessor shall be responsible for: (a) hiring,
	scheduling, disciplining and terminating Leased Employees as determined appropriate by Lessor; (b) determining the wages, salaries,
	benefits and other compensation payable to each Leased Employee; (c) paying all wages, salaries, benefits and other compensation
	earned by each Leased Employee; (d) collecting, withholding, reporting and paying all applicable federal, state and local payroll
	and other taxes; (e) providing all applicable workers’ compensation coverage and unemployment insurance for each Leased Employee;
	(f) providing coverage and benefits for each Leased Employee under those employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements which
	are offered by Lessor and in which the Leased Employees participate (the “Employee Benefits”); and (g) withholding
	all elective or required employee contributions, if any, attributable to the employee benefits from the wages of the Leased Employees.
	Notwithstanding the above, the Parties acknowledge and agree that there may be additional employee benefit plans or other benefits
	which may be offered by Lessee with mutual written consent of the Lessor and in which the Leased Employees may participate.

	3.          

	Lease
	Payments by Lessee

	.

	In consideration for the lease of each Leased Employee under this Agreement, Lessee shall make monthly
	lease payments to Lessor. Each monthly lease payment shall be made in arrears payable by the 15

	th

	day of each calendar
	month for services rendered by the Leased Employees to Lessee during the immediately preceding calendar month. The monthly lease
	payment shall be in an amount sufficient to fully reimburse Lessor for all costs associated with the employment of the Leased Employees
	during the applicable invoicing period. The lease payment for each Leased Employee shall be (a) 100% of the cost of the items set
	forth in Section 2 with respect to a Leased Employee; (b) multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the Leased Employee’s
	hours of service for Lessee during such month and (ii) the denominator of which is the Leased Employee’s total hours of service
	for Lessor and Lessee during such month. The Parties will maintain appropriate records of the hours of Leased Employees to accurately
	determine the amount payable by Lessee. In making any such calculations, any paid holidays, paid time off and/or vacation occurring
	during the Term (as defined below) shall be billed to Lessee as if the Leased Employee was working such days/hours

	.




	 




	4.          

	Term
	and Termination.





	 




	4.1.          

	The
	term of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and continue until this Agreement is terminated by either party upon 30
	days’ advance written notice to the other party (the “Term”).



	 




	4.2.          

	Expiration
	or termination of this Agreement shall not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties accruing prior to the effective date
	of such expiration or termination.



	 




	4.3.          

	Upon
	termination of this Agreement, the Leased Employees, or any one or more Leased Employee, may be hired by one of the Parties at
	its own discretion, at which time the other party’s responsibility for and duties with respect to such Leased Employees,
	whether arising under this Agreement or under applicable law, shall end.



	 




	5.          

	Supervision
	of Leased Employees/Holidays and Leave Policies


	.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Lessor and Lessee will
	have concurrent rights to exercise direction and control over all Leased Employees in the performance of their services for Lessee.
	Such control includes the right, in accordance with mutually acceptable policies and procedures, for either Lessor or Lessee to
	request the removal of any Leased Employee; provided, however, that Lessor shall retain responsibility for hiring, firing, payroll
	and all other administrative functions typically performed by an employer. Leased Employees shall be employed under a schedule
	for holidays and vacations and be subject to the sick leave policies of Lessor.



	 




	6.          

	Work
	Environment


	. Lessee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, at its own expense, a safe and suitable place
	for the Leased Employees to perform services for the Lessee. Lessee shall provide, at its expense, all necessary personal protective
	equipment and safety equipment and establish appropriate safety policies as may be required by law. Lessor and its designated representatives
	shall have the right but not the obligation to visit Lessee’s work site. However, the retention of such right does not relieve
	Lessee of any obligations it may have under federal or state law intended to provide the Leased Employees with a safe work environment.



	 




	7.          

	Records
	Related to Employment


	. Lessee shall be responsible for maintaining written records of hours worked by all hourly Leased
	Employees, including regular and overtime hours and such other records as are required under the FLSA and any applicable state,
	federal, or local law or regulation, and assumes full responsibility for the accuracy of all such records and reports, which Lessee
	shall maintain for a period of six years and shall make available to Lessor or a Leased Employee upon request, as required by law.

	8.          

	Independent
	Contractor.


	This Agreement creates a lessor-lessee relationship only. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute
	or be construed to be or create a partnership, joint venture, or agency between the Parties. The Parties acknowledge and agree
	that Lessor and its Leased Employees are acting solely as independent contractors of Lessee. While performing services for Lessee,
	the Leased Employees will be subject to all work rules and performance standards applicable to employees and contractors providing
	services for Lessee. If Lessee has written policies and procedures then Lessee may discipline any Leased Employee in accordance
	with Lessee’s policies and procedures or terminate the leasing arrangement hereunder with respect to any Leased Employee,
	in the event of any breach by such Leased Employee of Lessee’s written policies and procedures.



	 




	9.          

	Indemnification.


	Each Party shall indemnity and hold harmless the other Party from any liability, cost, expense, attorneys’ fees and costs
	(as and when incurred) and/or other expenditures, incurred or arising out of any breach of this Agreement or the negligence, intentional
	acts or other wrongful conduct or failure to act of such party with respect to the obligations of such indemnifying Party under
	this Agreement. This provision shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement. All claims of indemnity shall be immediately
	tendered to the indemnifying Party in writing. The indemnified Party shall, at the indemnifying Party’s expense, provide
	commercially reasonable assistance to the indemnifying Party in the defense of any indemnified claim. Any indemnified claim shall
	be litigated and/or settled at the indemnifying Party’s discretion.



	 




	10.         

	Compliance
	with Governing Law.


	Each Party agrees to comply with all local, state and federal laws in the performance of its respective
	obligations hereunder.



	 




	11.         

	Legal
	Process Affecting Wages


	. Lessee agrees to promptly forward to Lessor any garnishment orders, involuntary deduction orders,
	notices of IRS liens and other forms of legal process affecting the payment of wages to a Leased Employee and to cooperate with
	Lessor in responding to same.



	 




	12.         

	Notices.


	Any notice, request, demand, consent, approval of other communication required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing

	days after it is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

	WHEREAS,

	the Executive serves in a position
	of substantial responsibility with the Bank; and



	 




	WHEREAS,

	the Bank wishes to set forth the terms of the Executive’s continued employment in this position; and



	 




	WHEREAS,

	the Executive
	is willing and desires to continue to serve in this position with the Bank.



	 




	NOW THEREFORE,

	in consideration of these premises, the mutual covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration the receipt
	and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows.



	 




	ARTICLE 1




	EMPLOYMENT




	 




	1.1

	ARTICLE 3




	EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION




	 




	3.1           

	Termination
	Because of Death or Disability.





	 





	(a)

	            

	Death.


	 The
	Executive’s employment shall terminate automatically at the Executive’s death. If the Executive dies while in active
	service to the Bank, the Executive’s spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, his estate, shall receive any sums due
	to the Executive as Base Salary and reimbursement of expenses through the end of the month in which his death occurred.



	 





	(b)

	            

	Disability.


	 By
	delivery of written notice thirty (30) days in advance to the Executive, the Bank may terminate the Executive’s employment
	if the Executive is disabled. For purposes of this Agreement the Executive shall be considered “disabled” if an independent
	physician selected by the Bank and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, or the Executive’s legal representative, determines
	that, because of illness or accident, the Executive is unable to perform the Executive’s duties and will be unable to perform
	the Executive’s duties for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days. The Executive shall not be considered disabled, however,
	if the Executive returns to work on a full-time basis within thirty (30) days after the Bank gives notice of termination due to
	disability. If the Executive is terminated by either the Bank because of disability, the Executive’s employment with the
	other shall also terminate at the same time without further action. During the period of incapacity leading up to the termination
	of the Executive’s employment under this provision, the Bank shall continue to pay the full Base Salary at the rate then
	in effect and all perquisites and other benefits (other than bonus) until the Executive becomes eligible for benefits under any
	disability plan or insurance program maintained by the Bank, provided that the amount of the payments by the Bank to the Executive
	under this Section 3.1(b) shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to the Executive for the same period under
	any disability benefit or pension plan covering the Executive.



	 




		3.2           

	Involuntary
	Termination With Cause.


	The Bank may terminate the Executive’s employment for Cause. If the Executive’s employment
	terminates for Cause, the Executive shall receive the Base Salary through the date on which termination becomes effective and reimbursement
	of expenses to which the Executive is entitled when the termination becomes effective. The Executive shall not be deemed to have
	been terminated for Cause under this Agreement unless and until there is delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution adopted
	at a meeting of the board of directors of the Bank called and held for the purpose, which resolution shall (x) contain findings
	that the Executive has committed an act constituting Cause, and (y) specify the particulars thereof. The resolution of the board
	of directors shall be deemed to have been duly adopted if and only if it is adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
	directors of the Bank then in office, excluding the Executive. Notice of the meeting and the proposed termination for Cause shall
	be given to the Executive a reasonable time before the meeting of the board of directors. The Executive and the Executive’s
	counsel (if the Executive chooses to have counsel present) shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard by the board of directors
	at the meeting. For purposes of this Agreement “Cause” means any of the following:

	(1)

	damage to the Corporation or the Bank or its affiliates or injury to the business reputation of the Bank or its affiliates;




	 






	(3)


	incompetence (in determining incompetence, the Executive must have demonstrated a lack of ability
	to perform the duties assigned to him which lack of ability directly causes material injury to the Bank and the Executive’s
	acts or omissions shall be measured against standards generally prevailing in the community banking industry);




	 






	(4)


	a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit;




	 






	(5)


	the intentional failure to perform stated duties under this Agreement after written notice thereof

	or similar offenses) that reflects adversely on the reputation of the Corporation or the Bank or its affiliates, any felony conviction,
	any violation of law involving moral turpitude, or any violation of a final cease-and-desist order;




	 






	(7)


	failure of the subsidiary of the Bank, Q2 Business Capital LLC, to produce a profit (as determined
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or “GAAP”) for any two
	(2) consecutive fiscal quarters or any three (3) of six (6) consecutive quarters at any time following one (1) year from the date
	of this Agreement;




	 






	(8)


	the sale of the Bank’s membership interest in Q2 Business Capital, LLC (i) as a result of
	the exercise of the “Company Sale Right” (for any reason) as set forth in the Operating Agreement of Q2 Business Capital,
	LLC (the “Operating Agreement”), or (ii) pursuant to

	Section 7

	of the Operating Agreement;




	 






	(9)


	the dissolution of Q2 Business Capital, LLC pursuant to

	Article XII

	,

	Section 1

	of
	the Operating Agreement, except dissolution pursuant to

	Article XII

	,

	Section 1(c)

	of the Operating Agreement; or




	 






	(10)


	a material breach by the Executive of any provision of this Agreement.




	 


	No act, or failure to act, on the Executive’s
	part shall be considered “willful” unless he has acted, or failed to act, with an absence of good faith and without
	reasonable belief that his action or failure to act was in the best interest of the Bank.



	 




		3.3           

	Voluntary
	Termination by the Executive Without Good Reason.


	If the Executive terminates employment with the Bank without Good Reason,
	the Executive shall receive the Base Salary and expense reimbursement to which the Executive is entitled through the date on which
	termination becomes effective.

		3.4           

	Involuntary
	Termination Without Cause and Voluntary Termination with Good Reason.


	With written notice to the Executive at least thirty
	(30) days in advance, the Bank may terminate the Executive’s employment without Cause which shall be considered an “Involuntary
	Termination Without Cause”. The termination shall take effect at the end of the notice period. With advance written notice
	to the Bank, as provided in clause (b), the Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason which shall be considered a
	“Voluntary Termination With Good Reason”. If the Executive’s employment with the Bank terminates involuntarily
	without Cause or voluntarily but with Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits specified in Article 4 of this
	Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a Voluntary Termination With Good Reason may occur if the conditions stated in both
	clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 3.4 are satisfied:



	 



	(a)          a
	termination shall be considered a Voluntary Termination With Good Reason if any of the following occur without the Executive’s
	written consent, and the term “Good Reason” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without the Executive’s
	written consent:


	 






	(1)


	a material diminution of the Executive’s Base Salary;




	 






	(2)


	a material diminution of the Executive’s authority, duties, or responsibilities;




	 






	(3)


	a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the
	Executive is required to report;




	 






	(4)


	a change in the geographic location at which the Executive must perform services for the Bank from
	Louisville, Kentucky;




	 






	(5)


	the sale of the Bank’s membership interest in Q2 Business Capital, LLC, except (i) in the
	event of a “Change in Control”, as defined in the Operating Agreement, (ii) as a result of the exercise of the “Company
	Sale Right” (for any reason) as set forth in the Operating Agreement, or (iii) pursuant to

	Article V

	,

	Section 7

	of the Operating Agreement;




	 






	(6)


	the dissolution of the Q2 Business Capital, LLC by the Bank pursuant to

	Article XII

	,

	Section
	1(c)

	of the Operating Agreement;




	 






	(7)


	the Bank implements credit standards or guidelines more stringent than the “Initial Credit
	Guidelines”, as defined in the Operating Agreement, due to the requirement or recommendation by a regulator of the Bank or
	the Corporation, as contemplated in

	Article XI

	,

	Section 8

	of the Operating Agreement; or




	 






	(8)


	any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Bank under this Agreement.




	 


	(b)          the

	days after the initial existence of the condition, and the Bank shall have thirty (30) days thereafter to remedy the condition,
	but shall not be required to remedy the condition. In addition, the Executive’s voluntary termination because of the existence
	of one or more of the conditions described in clause (x) must occur within six (6) months after the initial existence of the condition.

	ARTICLE 4




	SEVERANCE COMPENSATION




	 




	4.1            

	Cash
	Severance after Termination Without Cause or Termination for Good Reason.


	 Subject to Section
	7.9 of this Agreement, if the Executive’s termination of employment with the Bank is considered an Involuntary Termination
	Without Cause or a Voluntary Termination With Good Reason, the Executive shall receive from the Bank the lesser of his Base Salary
	for the remaining term of the Agreement or one times his Base Salary, with the amount paid in a single lump sum within ten (10)
	calendar days of his termination. However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 4.1 shall
	be deemed void and unenforceable on their terms in the event Voluntary Termination With Good Reason occurs as a result of Section
	3.4(7) of this Agreement.



	 




	4.2            

	Post-Termination
	Insurance Coverage.


	If the Executive’s termination of employment with the Bank is considered an Involuntary Termination
	Without Cause or a Voluntary Termination With Good Reason, or because of disability, the Bank shall continue to provide to the
	Executive non-taxable medical insurance coverage substantially comparable (and on substantially the same terms and conditions)
	to the coverage maintained by the Bank for the Executive immediately prior to his termination under the same cost-sharing arrangements
	that apply for active employees of the Bank as of the Executive’s date of termination. This continued coverage shall cease
	upon the earlier of (i) the Executive’s return to employment with the Bank or another employer, (ii) the Executive’s
	attainment of age 65, (iii) the Executive’s death, (iv) the one-year anniversary of his termination date, or (v) the expiration
	of the remaining term of this Agreement. The period of continued health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Internal Revenue
	Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), shall run concurrently with the coverage period provided herein. If the Bank
	cannot provide the benefits set forth in this paragraph because the Executive is no longer an employee, applicable rules and regulations
	prohibit the benefits in the manner contemplated, or it would subject the Bank to penalties, then the Bank shall pay the Executive
	a cash lump sum payment reasonably estimated to be equal to the value of the benefits or the value of the remaining benefits at
	the time of the determination. The cash payment shall be made in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the later of the Executive’s
	date of termination of employment or the effective date of the rules or regulations prohibiting the benefits or subjecting the
	Bank to penalties. However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 4.1 shall be deemed void
	and unenforceable on their terms in the event Voluntary Termination With Good Reason occurs as a result of Section 3.4(7) of this
	Agreement.



	 




	ARTICLE 5




	CONFIDENTIALITY AND CREATIVE WORK




	 




	5.1            

	Non-disclosure.


	The Executive covenants and agrees not to reveal to any person, firm, or corporation any confidential information of any nature
	concerning the Corporation or the Bank or their business, or anything connected therewith. As used in this Article 5 the term “confidential
	information” means all of the confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets of the Corporation or the Bank and
	their affiliates in existence on the date hereof or existing at any time during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited
	to:


	 


	(a)          the
	whole or any portion or phase of any business plans, financial information, purchasing data, supplier data, accounting data, or
	other financial information;


	 


	(b)          the
	whole or any portion or phase of any research and development information, design procedures, algorithms or processes, or other
	technical information;


	 


	(c)          the
	whole or any portion or phase of any marketing or sales information, sales records, customer lists, prices, sales projections,
	or other sales information; and


	 


	(d)          trade
	secrets, as defined from time to time by the laws of Indiana. This Section 5.1 does not prohibit disclosure required by an order
	of a court having jurisdiction or a subpoena from an appropriate governmental agency or disclosure made by the Executive in the
	ordinary course of business and within the scope of the Executive’s authority.


	 






	 



	6



	 







	 




	 


	The term “confidential
	information” shall not include information (i) which at the time of disclosure has been published or is otherwise in the
	public domain; (ii) which, after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain other than through a breach of this Agreement; (iii)
	which was known to the recipient prior to receipt from the Executive, provided such prior knowledge can be adequately substantiated;
	(iv) which becomes known to a recipient from a source which legally derives such information independently of the Executive under
	this Agreement; (v) which is freely disclosed by the Bank or Corporation to a third party without an obligation of confidentiality
	or nondisclosure; or, (vi) which is disclosed pursuant to law, regulation or lawful order or process.



	 




		5.2           

	Return
	of Materials.


	The Executive agrees to immediately deliver or return to the Corporation and the Bank upon termination of
	employment, upon expiration of this Agreement, or as soon thereafter as possible, all written information and any other similar
	items furnished by the Corporation and the Bank or prepared by the Executive in connection with the Executive’s services
	hereunder and to immediately delete all electronically stored data of the Corporation and the Bank maintained on the Executive’s
	personal computers and to return all employer-provided computers or communication devices (i.e., laptop, tablet, etc.). The Executive
	will retain no copies thereof after termination of this Agreement or termination of the Executive’s employment.



	 




		5.3           

	Creative
	Work.


	The Executive agrees that all creative work and work product, including but not limited to all technology, business
	management tools, processes, software, patents, trademarks, and copyrights developed by the Executive during the term of this Agreement,
	regardless of when or where such work or work product was produced, constitutes work made for hire, all rights of which are owned
	by the Bank or its affiliates. The Executive hereby assigns to the Bank all rights, title, and interest, whether by way of copyrights,
	trade secret, trademark, patent, or otherwise, in all such work or work product, regardless of whether the same is subject to protection
	by patent, trademark, or copyright laws.



	 




	5.4           

	Affiliates’
	Confidential Information Covered; Confidentiality Obligation Survives Termination.


	For purposes of this Agreement, the
	term “affiliate” of the Corporation or the Bank includes any entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more
	intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Corporation or the Bank, and specifically includes
	Q2 Business Capital, LLC. The rights and obligations set forth in this Article 6 shall survive termination of this Agreement.



	 




	5.5           

	Injunctive
	Relief.


	The Executive acknowledges that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that will accrue to the Corporation
	and the Bank if the Executive fails to observe the obligations imposed by this Article 5. Accordingly, if the Corporation or the
	Bank institutes an action to enforce the provisions hereof, the Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that an adequate remedy
	at law is available to the Corporation or the Bank, and the Executive agrees not to urge in any such action the claim or defense
	that an adequate remedy at law exists. The confidentiality and remedies provisions of this Article 5 shall be in addition to and
	shall not be deemed to supersede or restrict, limit, or impair the Corporation’s or the Bank’s rights under applicable
	state or federal statute or regulation dealing with or providing a remedy for the wrongful disclosure, misuse, or misappropriation
	of trade secrets or proprietary or confidential information.

	6.3            

	Injunctive
	and Other Relief.


	Because of the unique character of the services to be rendered by the Executive hereunder, the Executive
	understands that the Corporation and the Bank would not have an adequate remedy at law for the material breach or threatened breach
	by the Executive of any one or more of the Executive’s covenants in this Article 6. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that
	the Corporation’s and the Bank’s remedies for a breach of this Article 6 include, but are not limited to, (x) forfeiture
	of any money representing accrued salary, contingent payments, or other fringe benefits (including any amount payable pursuant
	to Article 4) due and payable to the Executive during the period of any breach by Executive, and (y) a suit in equity by the Corporation
	or the Bank to enjoin the Executive from the breach or threatened breach of such covenants. The Executive hereby waives the claim
	or defense that an adequate remedy at law is available to the Corporation or the Bank and the Executive agrees not to urge in any
	such action the claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law exists. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Corporation
	or the Bank from pursuing any other or additional remedies for the breach or threatened breach.

	7.9            

	Compliance
	with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.




	 


	(a)          The
	Bank and the Executive intend that their exercise of authority or discretion under this Agreement shall comply with Section 409A
	of the Code. If any provision of this Agreement does not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall
	nevertheless be applied in a manner consistent with those requirements. If any provision of this Agreement would subject the Executive
	to additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the Bank shall reform the provision. However, the Bank shall maintain
	to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without subjecting the Executive to additional
	tax or interest, and the Bank shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a result of the reformed provision.


	 


	(b)          This
	Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and specifically, where applicable, with the
	“short-term deferral exception” under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and the “separation pay exception”
	under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A
	of the Code. If any payment or benefit hereunder cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions
	on the Executive under Section 409A of the Code, then such payment or benefit shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter
	when such sanctions will not be imposed. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, all payments to be made upon a termination of
	employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a “separation from service” (within the meaning of such term
	under Section 409A of the Code), each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment, the right to a
	series of installment payments under this Agreement (if any) is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and
	if a payment is not made by the designated payment date under this Agreement, the payment shall be made by December 31 of the calendar
	year in which the designated date occurs. To the extent that any payment provided for hereunder would be subject to additional
	tax under Section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of this Agreement to fail to satisfy the requirements of
	Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any such
	amount shall be payable in accordance with Section 8.9(c). In no event shall the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the
	calendar year of payment.


	 


	(c)          Notwithstanding
	anything herein to the contrary, if the Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A of
	the Code) and it is necessary to postpone the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable under this Agreement as
	a result of the Executive’s separation from service with the Bank to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section
	409A of the Code, then the Bank will postpone the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without
	any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Executive) that are not otherwise paid with the “short-term
	deferral exception” under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and the “separation pay exception” under
	Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months
	following the Executive’s separation of service with the Bank. If any payments are postponed due to such requirements, the
	postponed amounts will be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six
	months following the Executive’s separation of service with the Bank. If the Executive dies during the postponement period
	prior to the payment of postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409(A) of the Code shall be paid to the personal
	representative of the Executive’s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive’s death.


	 






	 



	11



	 







	 




	 


	(d)          Notwithstanding
	anything to the contrary herein, if any amounts paid or payable by the Bank under this Agreement to the Executive are subject to
	the additional income tax and related penalties and interest (the "409A Tax Amount") imposed by the IRS under Code Section
	409A and the Executive pays such 409A Tax Amount to the IRS, upon written notice by the Executive of the actual payment of the
	409A Tax Amount, the Bank will make a payment to the Executive within 60 days of his written notice in the amount of (i) such 409A
	Tax Amount, plus (ii) an amount so that the net payment to the Executive after federal, state and local taxes are deducted from
	the payment is equal to the 409A Tax Amount paid by the Executive to the IRS under Section 409A (collectively, the “Gross-Up
	Payment”).


	 



	7.10

	        


	Required
	Provisions.


	In the event any of the foregoing provisions of this Agreement conflict with the terms of this Section 7.10,
	this Section 7.10 shall prevail.


	 


	(a)          The
	Bank’s board of directors may terminate the Executive’s employment at any time, but any termination by the Bank, other
	than termination for Cause, shall be considered an Involuntary Termination Without Cause pursuant to Section 3.4 of this Agreement,
	in which case, the Executive shall be entitled to all rights and remedies afforded under Section 3.4 of this Agreement, including,
	without limitation, the Executive’s right to compensation or other benefits under this Agreement, and the remedies set forth
	under

	Article V

	,

	Section 5

	of Operating Agreement. The Executive shall not have the right to receive compensation
	or other benefits for any period after termination for Cause as defined in Section 3.2 of this Agreement or Voluntary Termination
	With Good Reason that occurs as a result of Section 3.4(a)(7) of this Agreement.


	 


	(b)          Any
	payments made to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to, and conditioned upon, their compliance
	with 12 U.S.C. Section 1828(k) and FDIC Regulation 12 C.F.R. Part 359, Golden Parachute and Indemnification Payments.

	EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION




	 




	3.1           

	Termination
	Because of Death or Disability.





	 





	(a)

	           

	Death.


	 The
	Executive’s employment shall terminate automatically at the Executive’s death. If the Executive dies while in active
	service to the Bank, the Executive’s spouse or, if there is no surviving spouse, his estate, shall receive any sums due

	(b)

	           

	Disability.


	 By
	delivery of written notice thirty (30) days in advance to the Executive, the Bank may terminate the Executive’s employment
	if the Executive is disabled. For purposes of this Agreement the Executive shall be considered “disabled” if an independent
	physician selected by the Bank and reasonably acceptable to the Executive, or the Executive’s legal representative, determines
	that, because of illness or accident, the Executive is unable to perform the Executive’s duties and will be unable to perform
	the Executive’s duties for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days. The Executive shall not be considered disabled, however,
	if the Executive returns to work on a full-time basis within thirty (30) days after the Bank gives notice of termination due to
	disability. If the Executive is terminated by either the Bank because of disability, the Executive’s employment with the
	other shall also terminate at the same time without further action. During the period of incapacity leading up to the termination
	of the Executive’s employment under this provision, the Bank shall continue to pay the full Base Salary at the rate then
	in effect and all perquisites and other benefits (other than bonus) until the Executive becomes eligible for benefits under any
	disability plan or insurance program maintained by the Bank, provided that the amount of the payments by the Bank to the Executive
	under this Section 3.1(b) shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts, if any, payable to the Executive for the same period under
	any disability benefit or pension plan covering the Executive.



	 




		3.2           

	Involuntary
	Termination With Cause.


	The Bank may terminate the Executive’s employment for Cause. If the Executive’s employment
	terminates for Cause, the Executive shall receive the Base Salary through the date on which termination becomes effective and reimbursement
	of expenses to which the Executive is entitled when the termination becomes effective. The Executive shall not be deemed to have
	been terminated for Cause under this Agreement unless and until there is delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution adopted
	at a meeting of the board of directors of the Bank called and held for the purpose, which resolution shall (x) contain findings
	that the Executive has committed an act constituting Cause, and (y) specify the particulars thereof. The resolution of the board
	of directors shall be deemed to have been duly adopted if and only if it is adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
	directors of the Bank then in office, excluding the Executive. Notice of the meeting and the proposed termination for Cause shall
	be given to the Executive a reasonable time before the meeting of the board of directors. The Executive and the Executive’s
	counsel (if the Executive chooses to have counsel present) shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard by the board of directors
	at the meeting. For purposes of this Agreement “Cause” means any of the following:

	(3)


	incompetence (in determining incompetence, the Executive must have demonstrated a lack of ability
	to perform the duties assigned to him which lack of ability directly causes material injury to the Bank and the Executive’s
	acts or omissions shall be measured against standards generally prevailing in the community banking industry);




	 






	(4)


	a breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit;

	(10)


	a material breach by the Executive of any provision of this Agreement.




	 


	No act, or failure to act, on the Executive’s
	part shall be considered “willful” unless he has acted, or failed to act, with an absence of good faith and without

		3.4           

	Involuntary
	Termination Without Cause and Voluntary Termination with Good Reason.


	With written notice to the Executive at least thirty
	(30) days in advance, the Bank may terminate the Executive’s employment without Cause which shall be considered an “Involuntary
	Termination Without Cause”. The termination shall take effect at the end of the notice period. With advance written notice
	to the Bank, as provided in clause (b), the Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason which shall be considered a
	“Voluntary Termination With Good Reason”. If the Executive’s employment with the Bank terminates involuntarily
	without Cause or voluntarily but with Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to the benefits specified in Article 4 of this

	clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 3.4 are satisfied:



	 



	(a)          a
	termination shall be considered a Voluntary Termination With Good Reason if any of the following occur without the Executive’s

	ARTICLE 4




	SEVERANCE COMPENSATION




	 




	4.1           

	Cash
	Severance after Termination Without Cause or Termination for Good Reason.


	Subject to Section 7.9 of this Agreement, if
	the Executive’s termination of employment with the Bank is considered an Involuntary Termination Without Cause or a Voluntary
	Termination With Good Reason, the Executive shall receive from the Bank the lesser of his Base Salary for the remaining term of
	the Agreement or one times his Base Salary, with the amount paid in a single lump sum within ten (10) calendar days of his termination.
	However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 4.1 shall be deemed void and unenforceable
	on their terms in the event Voluntary Termination With Good Reason occurs as a result of Section 3.4(7) of this Agreement.



	 




	4.2           

	Post-Termination
	Insurance Coverage.


	If the Executive’s termination of employment with the Bank is considered an Involuntary Termination
	Without Cause or a Voluntary Termination With Good Reason, or because of disability, the Bank shall continue to provide to the
	Executive non-taxable medical insurance coverage substantially comparable (and on substantially the same terms and conditions)
	to the coverage maintained by the Bank for the Executive immediately prior to his termination under the same cost-sharing arrangements
	that apply for active employees of the Bank as of the Executive’s date of termination. This continued coverage shall cease
	upon the earlier of (i) the Executive’s return to employment with the Bank or another employer, (ii) the Executive’s
	attainment of age 65, (iii) the Executive’s death, (iv) the one-year anniversary of his termination date, or (v) the expiration
	of the remaining term of this Agreement. The period of continued health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Internal Revenue
	Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), shall run concurrently with the coverage period provided herein. If the Bank
	cannot provide the benefits set forth in this paragraph because the Executive is no longer an employee, applicable rules and regulations
	prohibit the benefits in the manner contemplated, or it would subject the Bank to penalties, then the Bank shall pay the Executive
	a cash lump sum payment reasonably estimated to be equal to the value of the benefits or the value of the remaining benefits at
	the time of the determination. The cash payment shall be made in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the later of the Executive’s
	date of termination of employment or the effective date of the rules or regulations prohibiting the benefits or subjecting the
	Bank to penalties. However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 4.1 shall be deemed void
	and unenforceable on their terms in the event Voluntary Termination With Good Reason occurs as a result of Section 3.4(7) of this
	Agreement.



	 




	ARTICLE 5




	CONFIDENTIALITY AND CREATIVE WORK




	 




	5.1           

	Non-disclosure.


	The Executive covenants and agrees not to reveal to any person, firm, or corporation any confidential information of any nature
	concerning the Corporation or the Bank or their business, or anything connected therewith. As used in this Article 5 the term “confidential
	information” means all of the confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets of the Corporation or the Bank and
	their affiliates in existence on the date hereof or existing at any time during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited
	to:

	whole or any portion or phase of any research and development information, design procedures, algorithms or processes, or other
	technical information;


	 


	(c)          the
	whole or any portion or phase of any marketing or sales information, sales records, customer lists, prices, sales projections,
	or other sales information; and


	 


	(d)          trade
	secrets, as defined from time to time by the laws of Indiana. This Section 5.1 does not prohibit disclosure required by an order
	of a court having jurisdiction or a subpoena from an appropriate governmental agency or disclosure made by the Executive in the
	ordinary course of business and within the scope of the Executive’s authority.


	 






	 



	6



	 







	 




	 


	The term “confidential
	information” shall not include information (i) which at the time of disclosure has been published or is otherwise in the
	public domain; (ii) which, after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain other than through a breach of this Agreement; (iii)
	which was known to the recipient prior to receipt from the Executive, provided such prior knowledge can be adequately substantiated;
	(iv) which becomes known to a recipient from a source which legally derives such information independently of the Executive under
	this Agreement; (v) which is freely disclosed by the Bank or Corporation to a third party without an obligation of confidentiality
	or nondisclosure; or, (vi) which is disclosed pursuant to law, regulation or lawful order or process.



	 




		5.2           

	Return
	of Materials.


	The Executive agrees to immediately deliver or return to the Corporation and the Bank upon termination of
	employment, upon expiration of this Agreement, or as soon thereafter as possible, all written information and any other similar
	items furnished by the Corporation and the Bank or prepared by the Executive in connection with the Executive’s services
	hereunder and to immediately delete all electronically stored data of the Corporation and the Bank maintained on the Executive’s
	personal computers and to return all employer-provided computers or communication devices (i.e., laptop, tablet, etc.). The Executive
	will retain no copies thereof after termination of this Agreement or termination of the Executive’s employment.



	 




		5.3           

	Creative
	Work.


	The Executive agrees that all creative work and work product, including but not limited to all technology, business
	management tools, processes, software, patents, trademarks, and copyrights developed by the Executive during the term of this Agreement,
	regardless of when or where such work or work product was produced, constitutes work made for hire, all rights of which are owned
	by the Bank or its affiliates. The Executive hereby assigns to the Bank all rights, title, and interest, whether by way of copyrights,
	trade secret, trademark, patent, or otherwise, in all such work or work product, regardless of whether the same is subject to protection
	by patent, trademark, or copyright laws.



	 




	5.4           

	Affiliates’
	Confidential Information Covered; Confidentiality Obligation Survives Termination.


	For purposes of this Agreement, the
	term “affiliate” of the Corporation or the Bank includes any entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more
	intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Corporation or the Bank, and specifically includes
	Q2 Business Capital, LLC. The rights and obligations set forth in this Article 6 shall survive termination of this Agreement.



	 




	5.5           

	Injunctive
	Relief.


	The Executive acknowledges that it is impossible to measure in money the damages that will accrue to the Corporation
	and the Bank if the Executive fails to observe the obligations imposed by this Article 5. Accordingly, if the Corporation or the
	Bank institutes an action to enforce the provisions hereof, the Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that an adequate remedy
	at law is available to the Corporation or the Bank, and the Executive agrees not to urge in any such action the claim or defense
	that an adequate remedy at law exists. The confidentiality and remedies provisions of this Article 5 shall be in addition to and
	shall not be deemed to supersede or restrict, limit, or impair the Corporation’s or the Bank’s rights under applicable
	state or federal statute or regulation dealing with or providing a remedy for the wrongful disclosure, misuse, or misappropriation
	of trade secrets or proprietary or confidential information.

	(c)          The
	Executive acknowledges that the Bank’s willingness to enter into this Agreement and to make the payments contemplated by

	6.3           

	Injunctive
	and Other Relief.


	Because of the unique character of the services to be rendered by the Executive hereunder, the Executive
	understands that the Corporation and the Bank would not have an adequate remedy at law for the material breach or threatened breach
	by the Executive of any one or more of the Executive’s covenants in this Article 6. Accordingly, the Executive agrees that
	the Corporation’s and the Bank’s remedies for a breach of this Article 6 include, but are not limited to, (x) forfeiture
	of any money representing accrued salary, contingent payments, or other fringe benefits (including any amount payable pursuant
	to Article 4) due and payable to the Executive during the period of any breach by Executive, and (y) a suit in equity by the Corporation
	or the Bank to enjoin the Executive from the breach or threatened breach of such covenants. The Executive hereby waives the claim
	or defense that an adequate remedy at law is available to the Corporation or the Bank and the Executive agrees not to urge in any
	such action the claim or defense that an adequate remedy at law exists. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Corporation
	or the Bank from pursuing any other or additional remedies for the breach or threatened breach.

	Agreement shall be binding upon the Bank and any successors to the Bank, including any persons acquiring directly or indirectly
	all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Bank by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization, or otherwise,
	but this Agreement and the Bank’s obligations under this Agreement are not otherwise assignable, transferable, or delegable

	same extent the Bank would be required to perform had no succession occurred.

	Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s personal or legal representatives, executors,

	or transfer that is contrary to this Section 7.1, the Bank shall have no liability to pay any amount to the assignee or transferee.



	 




	7.2           

	Governing
	Law, Jurisdiction and Forum.


	This Agreement shall be construed under and governed by the internal laws of the State of

	of directors of the Bank at the Bank’s executive offices.



	 




	7.5           

	Severability.


	If there is a conflict between any provision of this Agreement and any statute, regulation, or judicial precedent, the latter shall
	prevail, but the affected provisions of this Agreement shall be curtailed and limited solely to the extent necessary to bring them
	within the requirements of law. If any provisions of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be indefinite,

	Amendment
	and Waiver.


	This Agreement may not be amended, released, discharged, abandoned, changed, or modified in any manner, except
	by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of
	the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor affect the validity of this Agreement
	or any part thereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver or any breach of this
	Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

	7.9          

	Compliance
	with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.




	 


	(a)          The
	Bank and the Executive intend that their exercise of authority or discretion under this Agreement shall comply with Section 409A
	of the Code. If any provision of this Agreement does not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall
	nevertheless be applied in a manner consistent with those requirements. If any provision of this Agreement would subject the Executive
	to additional tax or interest under Section 409A of the Code, the Bank shall reform the provision. However, the Bank shall maintain
	to the maximum extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without subjecting the Executive to additional
	tax or interest, and the Bank shall not be required to incur any additional compensation expense as a result of the reformed provision.


	 


	(b)          This
	Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and specifically, where applicable, with the
	“short-term deferral exception” under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and the “separation pay exception”
	under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), and shall in all respects be administered in accordance with Section 409A
	of the Code. If any payment or benefit hereunder cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions
	on the Executive under Section 409A of the Code, then such payment or benefit shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter
	when such sanctions will not be imposed. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, all payments to be made upon a termination of
	employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a “separation from service” (within the meaning of such term
	under Section 409A of the Code), each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment, the right to a
	series of installment payments under this Agreement (if any) is to be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and
	if a payment is not made by the designated payment date under this Agreement, the payment shall be made by December 31 of the calendar
	year in which the designated date occurs. To the extent that any payment provided for hereunder would be subject to additional
	tax under Section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of this Agreement to fail to satisfy the requirements of
	Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law, and any such
	amount shall be payable in accordance with Section 8.9(c). In no event shall the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the
	calendar year of payment.


	 


	(c)          Notwithstanding
	anything herein to the contrary, if the Executive is a “specified employee” (within the meaning of Section 409A of
	the Code) and it is necessary to postpone the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable under this Agreement as
	a result of the Executive’s separation from service with the Bank to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section
	409A of the Code, then the Bank will postpone the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without
	any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Executive) that are not otherwise paid with the “short-term
	deferral exception” under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and the “separation pay exception” under
	Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months
	following the Executive’s separation of service with the Bank. If any payments are postponed due to such requirements, the
	postponed amounts will be paid to the Executive in a lump sum on the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six
	months following the Executive’s separation of service with the Bank. If the Executive dies during the postponement period
	prior to the payment of postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409(A) of the Code shall be paid to the personal
	representative of the Executive’s estate within sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive’s death.


	 






	 



	11



	 







	 




	 


	(d)          Notwithstanding
	anything to the contrary herein, if any amounts paid or payable by the Bank under this Agreement to the Executive are subject to
	the additional income tax and related penalties and interest (the "409A Tax Amount") imposed by the IRS under Code Section
	409A and the Executive pays such 409A Tax Amount to the IRS, upon written notice by the Executive of the actual payment of the
	409A Tax Amount, the Bank will make a payment to the Executive within 60 days of his written notice in the amount of (i) such 409A
	Tax Amount, plus (ii) an amount so that the net payment to the Executive after federal, state and local taxes are deducted from
	the payment is equal to the 409A Tax Amount paid by the Executive to the IRS under Section 409A (collectively, the “Gross-Up
	Payment”).


	 



	7.10

	        


	Required
	Provisions.


	In the event any of the foregoing provisions of this Agreement conflict with the terms of this Section 7.10,
	this Section 7.10 shall prevail.


	 


	(a)          The
	Bank’s board of directors may terminate the Executive’s employment at any time, but any termination by the Bank, other
	than termination for Cause, shall be considered an Involuntary Termination Without Cause pursuant to Section 3.4 of this Agreement,
	in which case, the Executive shall be entitled to all rights and remedies afforded under Section 3.4 of this Agreement, including,
	without limitation, the Executive’s right to compensation or other benefits under this Agreement, and the remedies set forth
	under

	Article V

	FIRST SAVINGS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. REPORTS
	2017 SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS


	 


	Clarksville, Indiana—April 27, 2017.
	First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSFG - news) (the "Company"), the holding company for First Savings Bank
	(the "Bank"), today reported net income and net income available to common shareholders of $2.2 million, or $0.94 per
	diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to net income and net income available to common shareholders
	of $1.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	Net interest income increased $1.1 million
	for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Interest income increased $1.1 million when comparing
	the two periods due primarily to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $89.0 million, from $688.1 million
	for 2016 to $777.1 million for 2017, and an increase in the average tax-equivalent yield from 4.31% for 2016 to 4.43% for 2017.
	Interest expense increased $4,000 when comparing the two periods due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing
	liabilities of $60.1 million, from $582.1 million for 2016 to $642.2 million for 2017, which more than offset a decrease in the
	average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, from 0.71% for 2016 to 0.64% for 2017.


	 


	The Company recognized $375,000 in provision
	for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio, as
	compared to $125,000 of provision for loan losses recognized for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The loan portfolio increased
	$14.8 million for the 2017 quarter as compared to an increase of $18.3 million for the 2016 quarter. Nonperforming loans, which
	consist of nonaccrual loans and loans over 90 days past due and still accruing interest, decreased $172,000, from $3.9 million
	at September 30, 2016 to $3.7 million at March 31, 2017. The Company recognized net charge-offs of $76,000 for the 2017 quarter
	as compared to net charge-offs of $18,000 for the 2016 quarter.


	 


	Noninterest income increased $599,000 for
	the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to the recognition of net
	gain on sales of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) of $949,000 in the second quarter
	of 2017. There were no comparable gains in 2016. The increase in net gain on sales of SBA guaranteed loans was offset by a decrease
	in real estate lease income of $163,000 due to the sale of the Company’s commercial real estate development in September
	2016 and the recognition of a $226,000 impairment loss on a tax credit investment during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	Noninterest expense increased $834,000
	for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits
	of $852,000. The increase was attributable to the addition of new employees to support the Company’s SBA lending activities
	as well as normal salary and benefits adjustments.


	 




	 





	 




	 


	The Company recognized income tax expense
	of $413,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, for an effective tax rate of 15.8% as compared to income tax expense of $389,000,
	for an effective tax rate of 19.2%, for the same period in 2016. The decrease in effective tax rate was due to the recognition
	of $249,000 in historic tax credits and an increase in tax-exempt securities income of $192,000 for the quarter ended March 31,
	2017 as compared to 2016.



	 




	Results of Operations for the Six Months
	Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016




	 



	The Company reported net income and net
	income available to common shareholders of $4.5 million, or $1.94 per diluted common share, for the six-month period ended March
	31, 2017 compared to net income of $2.9 million and net income available to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $1.22 per diluted
	common share, for the six-month period ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	Net interest income increased $1.9 million
	for the six-months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Interest income increased $2.0 million when comparing
	the two periods due primarily to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $76.6 million, from $681.5 million
	for 2016 to $758.1 million for 2017, and an increase in the average tax-equivalent yield from 4.37% for 2016 to 4.47% for 2017.
	Interest expense increased $58,000 due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $59.6 million,
	from $573.7 million for 2016 to $633.3 million for 2017, which more than offset a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing
	liabilities, from 0.70% for 2016 to 0.65% for 2017.


	 


	The Company recognized $681,000 in provision
	for loan losses for the six-months ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio, as compared to $125,000
	of provision for loan losses recognized for the six-months ended March 31, 2016. The loan portfolio increased $31.2 million for
	the six-months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to an increase of $21.5 million for the same period in 2016. The Company recognized
	net charge-offs of $85,000 for the six-months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to net recoveries of $2,000 for the same period
	in 2016.


	 


	Noninterest income increased $1.0 million
	for the six months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in
	net gain on sales of loans guaranteed by the SBA of $1.7 million, which more than offset decreases in net gain (loss) on trading
	account securities and real estate lease income of $499,000 and $326,000, respectively. The decrease in net gain (loss) on trading
	account securities is due to market volatility in the municipal bond sector during the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease
	in real estate lease income is due to the sale of the Company’s commercial real estate development in September 2016.


	 




	 





	 




	 


	Noninterest expense increased $482,000
	for the six-months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to increases in
	compensation and benefits of $830,000, which more than offset decreases in net (gain) loss on other real estate owned and professional
	fees of $159,000 and $111,000, respectively. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was attributable to the addition
	of new employees to support the Company’s SBA lending activities as well as normal salary and benefits adjustments. The decrease
	in (gain) loss on other real estate owned was due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred gains for properties sold
	and financed by the Company. Professional fees decreased primarily from reduced performance-based investment advisor fees on the
	trading account securities portfolio.


	 


	The Company recognized income tax expense
	of $1.1 million for the six-months ended March 31, 2017, for an effective tax rate of 19.4% as compared to income tax expense of
	$856,000, for an effective tax rate of 22.9%, for the same period in 2016. The decrease in effective tax rate was due primarily
	to the aforementioned recognition of $249,000 in historic tax credits during 2017 and an increase in tax-exempt securities income
	of $209,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.



	 




	Comparison of Financial Condition at
	March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016



	 


	Total assets increased $44.1 million, from
	$796.5 million at September 30, 2016 to $840.6 million at March 31, 2017. Net loans increased $30.6 million, due primarily to continued
	growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio and to an increase in SBA-guaranteed loans held for sale of $10.9 million.
	Total deposits increased $51.8 million due primarily to increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposit and interest-bearing demand
	deposit accounts of $18.9 million and $32.8 million, respectively. The increase in interest-bearing demand deposits was due primarily
	to an increase in cash management accounts.


	 


	Stockholders’ equity increased $1.1
	million, from $86.6 million at September 30, 2016 to $87.7 million at March 31, 2017, due to net income, less dividends, of $3.9
	million partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. At March 31, 2017, the Bank was
	considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital guidelines.

CLARKSVILLE, Ind. and ODON, Ind., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:FSFG) ("FSFG"), the holding company for First Savings Bank ("First Savings"), and The First National Bank of Odon ("FNBO") announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of FNBO by FSFG through a merger of FNBO with and into First Savings.
The all-cash transaction is valued at approximately $10.6 million, subject to possible adjustment. FNBO shareholders will be entitled to receive $265.00 in cash in exchange for each share of FNBO common stock owned, subject to decrease if FNBO's shareholders' equity as of the month-end immediately before closing is less than FNBO's shareholders' equity of $8.0 million as of June 30, 2017. The per-share consideration would be decreased dollar-for-dollar in relation to the amount of any such decrease in FNBO's shareholders' equity. Certain transaction expenses, among them the fees and expenses related to data processing contract termination and deconversion as well as professional fees and expenses incurred by FNBO, are excluded from the calculation of FNBO's stockholders' equity at the month-end before closing.
As of June 30, 2017, FNBO had total assets of $99.2 million, with loans of $35.8 million, deposits of $91.0 million and stockholders' equity of $8.0 million. FNBO operates two branches in Daviess County, Indiana. The purchase price represents 132% of FNBO's tangible book value and 15.0x its LTM earnings.
The closing of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions, including the approval of FNBO's shareholders and regulatory approval. Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Larry W. Myers, FSFG's and First Savings' President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very excited for the opportunity to partner with this terrific franchise for the benefit of our new clients, the communities in Daviess County and our shareholders. It is rewarding to bring additional products, services and support to these clients and communities. The addition of these offices to the First Savings network provides for a 17% market share in Daviess County and establishes a new market in which we can expand our franchise. Moreover, it continues to demonstrate our commitment to serving and expanding throughout the southern Indiana market. We anticipate that this transaction will be accretive to earnings in the first year, excluding one-time transaction related expenses, improve funding sources for continued growth, and enhance near and long-term shareholder value."
Ms. Dearmin-Turner, Chairperson of the Board of Directors of FNBO, stated, "We are pleased with the opportunity to partner with the First Savings Bank family and the increased opportunities this provides our customers, employees and the community we serve. First Savings' demonstrated commitment to preserve true community banking, which means local decision-making, retention of local staff, commitment to community involvement, and personal one-on-one service, will be keys to our joint and future success. In addition, we are excited about First Savings' ability to offer higher lending limits to help us serve the business and agricultural communities."
Luse Gorman, PC acted as legal counsel to FSFG and First Savings, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. acted as financial advisor. Barnes & Thornburg LLP acted as legal counsel to FNBO, and Renninger & Associates, LLC acted as financial advisor and rendered a fairness opinion to FNBO.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the proposed transaction. These statements include statements regarding the anticipated closing date of the transaction and anticipated future results. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words like "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," and "intend" or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could" or "may." Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include delays in completing the transaction; difficulties in achieving cost savings from the transaction or in achieving such cost savings within the expected time frame; difficulties in integrating the operations of FNBO and First Savings; increased competitive pressures; changes in the interest rate environment; changes in general economic conditions; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the business in which First Saving and FNBO are engaged; changes in the securities markets; and other risks and uncertainties disclosed from time to time in documents that FSFG files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

First Savings' demonstrated commitment to preserve true community banking, which means local decision-making, retention of local staff, commitment to community involvement, and personal one-on-one service, will be keys to our joint and future success. In addition, we are excited about First Savings' ability to offer higher lending limits to help us serve the business and agricultural communities."  Luse Gorman, PC acted as legal counsel to FSFG and First Savings, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. acted as financial advisor. Barnes & Thornburg LLP acted as legal counsel to FNBO, and Renninger & Associates, LLC acted as financial advisor and rendered a fairness opinion to FNBO.

Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include delays in completing the transaction; difficulties in achieving cost savings from the transaction or in achieving such cost savings within the expected time frame; difficulties in integrating the operations of FNBO and First Savings; increased competitive pressures; changes in the interest rate environment; changes in general economic conditions; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the business in which First Saving and FNBO are engaged; changes in the securities markets; and other risks and uncertainties disclosed from time to time in documents that FSFG files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

First Savings Financial Group, Inc. And The First National Bank Of Odon Sign Definitive Acquisition Agreement






GlobeNewswire



Jul 21, 2017 5:30 PM EDT













 




























































 CLARKSVILLE, Ind. and ODON, Ind., July 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:FSFG) ("FSFG"), the holding company for First Savings Bank ("First Savings"), and The First National Bank of Odon ("FNBO") announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of FNBO by FSFG through a merger of FNBO with and into First Savings. The all-cash transaction is valued at approximately $10.6 million, subject to possible adjustment. FNBO shareholders will be entitled to receive $265.00 in cash in exchange for each share of FNBO common stock owned, subject to decrease if FNBO's shareholders' equity as of the month-end immediately before closing is less than FNBO's shareholders' equity of $8.0 million as of June 30, 2017. The per-share consideration would be decreased dollar-for-dollar in relation to the amount of any such decrease in FNBO's shareholders' equity. Certain transaction expenses, among them the fees and expenses related to data processing contract termination and deconversion as well as professional fees and expenses incurred by FNBO, are excluded from the calculation of FNBO's stockholders' equity at the month-end before closing. As of June 30, 2017, FNBO had total assets of $99.2 million, with loans of $35.8 million, deposits of $91.0 million and stockholders' equity of $8.0 million. FNBO operates two branches in Daviess County, Indiana. The purchase price represents 132% of FNBO's tangible book value and 15.0x its LTM earnings. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions, including the approval of FNBO's shareholders and regulatory approval. Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017. Larry W. Myers, FSFG's and First Savings' President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are very excited for the opportunity to partner with this terrific franchise for the benefit of our new clients, the communities in Daviess County and our shareholders. It is rewarding to bring additional products, services and support to these clients and communities. The addition of these offices to the First Savings network provides for a 17% market share in Daviess County and establishes a new market in which we can expand our franchise. Moreover, it continues to demonstrate our commitment to serving and expanding throughout the southern Indiana market. We anticipate that this transaction will be accretive to earnings in the first year, excluding one-time transaction related expenses, improve funding sources for continued growth, and enhance near and long-term shareholder value."

First Savings Financial Group, Inc. and The First National Bank of Odon Sign Definitive Acquisition Agreement




















July 21, 2017 17:30 ET

 | Source: First Savings Financial Group, Inc.






CLARKSVILLE, Ind. and ODON, Ind., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Savings Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:FSFG) (“FSFG”), the holding company for First Savings Bank (“First Savings”), and The First National Bank of Odon (“FNBO”) announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition of FNBO by FSFG through a merger of FNBO with and into First Savings. The all-cash transaction is valued at approximately $10.6 million, subject to possible adjustment. FNBO shareholders will be entitled to receive $265.00 in cash in exchange for each share of FNBO common stock owned, subject to decrease if FNBO’s shareholders’ equity as of the month-end immediately before closing is less than FNBO’s shareholders’ equity of $8.0 million as of June 30, 2017. The per-share consideration would be decreased dollar-for-dollar in relation to the amount of any such decrease in FNBO’s shareholders’ equity. Certain transaction expenses, among them the fees and expenses related to data processing contract termination and deconversion as well as professional fees and expenses incurred by FNBO, are excluded from the calculation of FNBO’s stockholders’ equity at the month-end before closing. As of June 30, 2017, FNBO had total assets of $99.2 million, with loans of $35.8 million, deposits of $91.0 million and stockholders’ equity of $8.0 million. FNBO operates two branches in Daviess County, Indiana. The purchase price represents 132% of FNBO’s tangible book value and 15.0x its LTM earnings. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions, including the approval of FNBO’s shareholders and regulatory approval. Closing is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017. Larry W. Myers, FSFG’s and First Savings’ President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very excited for the opportunity to partner with this terrific franchise for the benefit of our new clients, the communities in Daviess County and our shareholders. It is rewarding to bring additional products, services and support to these clients and communities. The addition of these offices to the First Savings network provides for a 17% market share in Daviess County and establishes a new market in which we can expand our franchise. Moreover, it continues to demonstrate our commitment to serving and expanding throughout the southern Indiana market. We anticipate that this transaction will be accretive to earnings in the first year, excluding one-time transaction related expenses, improve funding sources for continued growth, and enhance near and long-term shareholder value.” Ms. Dearmin-Turner, Chairperson of the Board of Directors of FNBO, stated, “We are pleased with the opportunity to partner with the First Savings Bank family and the increased opportunities this provides our customers, employees and the community we serve. First Savings’ demonstrated commitment to preserve true community banking, which means local decision-making, retention of local staff, commitment to community involvement, and personal one-on-one service, will be keys to our joint and future success. In addition, we are excited about First Savings’ ability to offer higher lending limits to help us serve the business and agricultural communities.” Luse Gorman, PC acted as legal counsel to FSFG and First Savings, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. acted as financial advisor. Barnes & Thornburg LLP acted as legal counsel to FNBO, and Renninger & Associates, LLC acted as financial advisor and rendered a fairness opinion to FNBO. About First Savings Financial Group, Inc. and First Savings Bank FSFG is the financial holding company for First Savings, which operates fourteen offices in the Indiana communities of Clarksville, Jeffersonville, Charlestown, Sellersburg, New Albany, Georgetown, Corydon, Lanesville, Elizabeth, English, Leavenworth, Marengo and Salem. Additional information can be found on First Savings’ website at www.fsbbank.net. At June 30, 2017, FSFG had total consolidated assets of $874.1 million.

These statements include statements regarding the anticipated closing date of the transaction and anticipated future results. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words like “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and “intend” or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” or “may.” Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include delays in completing the transaction; difficulties in achieving cost savings from the transaction or in achieving such cost savings within the expected time frame; difficulties in integrating the operations of FNBO and First Savings; increased competitive pressures; changes in the interest rate environment; changes in general economic conditions; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the business in which First Saving and FNBO are engaged; changes in the securities markets; and other risks and uncertainties disclosed from time to time in documents that FSFG files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
