Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan.  05, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achaogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel antibacterials addressing multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections, today announced the appointment of Halley Gilbert, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to its Board of Directors. Ms. Gilbert brings significant strategic leadership and two decades of experience navigating biopharmaceutical companies through various phases of growth and opportunity. “Halley’s expertise and counsel come at an exciting time for our company, as we pursue regulatory approval of our lead product candidate, plazomicin, for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae,” said Kenneth Hillan, M.B. Ch.B., Achaogen's Chief Executive Officer. “Halley’s seasoned judgment and success helping biotechnology companies build and integrate critical functions and bring new products to market will be invaluable to Achaogen as we enter our next phase of growth and beyond.” "I have tremendous respect for Achaogen’s passion and commitment to developing innovative medicine and making patients’ lives better,” said Ms. Gilbert. “I look forward to working with existing board members and the Achaogen management team to support plazomicin’s commercial objectives and advance the Company’s pipeline of promising candidates.” Ms. Gilbert joined Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals in 2008 as a founding member of its legal department, providing leadership and oversight and establishing the Company’s compliance function as Ironwood grew from a privately-held, research-based organization to a publicly-traded, fully-integrated commercial biotechnology company. Prior to Ironwood, Ms. Gilbert was Vice President, Deputy General Counsel at Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from 2002 to 2008, where she supported the launch of Cubist’s first acute care antibiotic, and she served as Corporate Counsel at Genzyme Corp. from 1999 to 2001. Ms. Gilbert began her legal career at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, where she specialized in mergers and acquisitions and securities law. Ms. Gilbert received a J.D. from Northwestern University School of Law in Illinois and a B.A. from Tufts University in Massachusetts. She is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Allergy Amulet, Inc., a privately-held allergy device company, and of Greater Boston Legal Services, a not-for-profit entity that provides free legal services to more than 10,000 individuals and families in need per year.
