Health Products Holdings has acquired the True Health, Health Resources and Vitamin Research Products brands



 








Sunrise, FL ( August 31st, 2015) –  Health Products Holdings, LLC (“HPH”) has acquired from Vitamin Research Products, LLC all of its brands and related assets, including the well-known direct-to-consumer brands Vitamin Research Products (“VRP”), True Health (“TH”), and Health Resources (“HR”).   
All three brands complement HPH’s existing direct-to-consumer portfolio of brands, which included Iceland Health®, Blessed Herbs®, and Nutri-Health Supplements®. 
“VRP brings market-leading products and significant talent that will partner well with our current brands, and provide customers exciting new choices to meet their specific health needs, now and in the future,” said Tom Callahan, President of the direct-to-consumer business for HPH. 
“The entire VRP marketing team is thrilled to be joining forces with HPH. We look forward to multiple opportunities to grow our brands and build our leadership position in the direct-to-consumer nutritional supplement industry,” said Kelly Cleary, formerly with VRP and now VP of Direct-to-Consumer Marketing for the combined business. 
Added Mike Burroughs, now VP of IS and Digital Marketing, “I believe VRP will benefit greatly from the additional financial and operational resources HPH will provide. We are very excited about the growth potential of our new, combined business.” 
HPH’s direct-to-consumer team now combines some of the very best national talent in the industry across the catalog and digital marketing space with over a century of cumulative experience in direct-to-consumer marketing, hundreds of thousands of active customers, and over 400 unique supplement formulations to serve them. 
This is the second acquisition in the past 10 months for Health Products Holdings as it continues to aggressively strengthen capabilities and expand its branded product portfolio across different areas of the nutritional supplements market, covering a broad portfolio of products across all channels.
About Health Product Holdings, LLC 
Health Products Holdings, LLC, previously known as Nature’s Products, Inc., was founded in 1986 as a full service, GMP certified, contract manufacturer of consumer healthcare products in Sunrise, Florida. In addition to contract manufacturing, HPH now owns, produces, and markets its own portfolio of brands including Rainbow Light®, Champion Nutrition®, Iceland Health®, Nutri-Health Supplements®, Sedona Labs®, Sedona Pro®, Blessed Herbs® and VitalStyle®. HPH currently employs over 400 employees and offers a wide range of formulations, dosage forms, and manufacturing and packaging capabilities. Also, HPH has several affiliated businesses globally that expand the breadth of its capabilities and dosage forms beyond the nutritional supplement area. More information about Health Product Holdings can be found at www.hph-llc.com.
