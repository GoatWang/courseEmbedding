1

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

. This healthcare provider has their gender reported as 'not applicable'.Speciality : Pain Medicine Anesthesiology - This area of medicine looks at an interdisciplinary approach for relieving pain and suffering and improving the overall quality of life of those living with pain. This approach normally utilizes the team of medical doctors, physiotherapists, clinical psychologists, nurse practitioners and occupational therapists.  Treatment for longer term pain include pharmacology measures including tricyclic antidepressants, analgesics and anticonvulsants, physical therapy, exercise, heat and ice application, intervention and psychological measures.  This Specialty Falls in this Following Category:Allopathic and Osteopathic Physicians - Allopathic physicians are general doctors (Medical Doctor or MD), whereas osteopathic physicians (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine or DO) deal specifically with Osteopathy, targeting in healing the body with minimal use of medicine with an emphasis focusing on preventative care. Both types are fully licensed physicians, educated in diagnosing, as well as offering treatment for various illnesses and disorders.Anesthesiology - Anesthesiology is when a doctor studies and practices the administering of sedation and or anesthesia to a patient for the intent of blocking pain.  This branch of medicine is often looked at as mysterious because nobody really knows what happens when someone is 'put under.'  Anesthesiologists work to prevent a patient from feeling pain during a surgical procedure, as well as dealing with it after the surgery.

Important Safety Information

Indication

        SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine and naloxone) Sublingual Film (CIII) is a prescription medicine indicated for treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.
Treatment should be initiated under the direction of healthcare providers qualified under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act.



Important Safety Information

        Do not take SUBOXONE Film if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious negative effects, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.
    

        SUBOXONE Film can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit.
    

        SUBOXONE Film contains buprenorphine, an opioid that can cause physical dependence with chronic use. Physical dependence is not the same as addiction. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the difference between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not stop taking SUBOXONE Film suddenly without talking to your healthcare provider. You could become sick with uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms because your body has become used to this medicine.
    

        SUBOXONE Film can cause serious life-threatening breathing problems, overdose and death, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other medications that act on the nervous system (ie, sedatives, tranquilizers, or alcohol). It is extremely dangerous to take nonprescribed benzodiazepines or other medications that act on the nervous system while taking SUBOXONE Film.
    

        You should not drink alcohol while taking SUBOXONE Film, as this can lead to loss of consciousness or even death.
    

        Death has been reported in those who are not opioid dependent.
    

        Your healthcare provider may monitor liver function before and during treatment.
    

        SUBOXONE Film is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. However, SUBOXONE Film may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone.
    

        Keep SUBOXONE Film out of the sight and reach of children. Accidental or deliberate ingestion of SUBOXONE Film by a child can cause severe breathing problems and death.
    

        Do not take SUBOXONE Film before the effects of other opioids (eg, heroin, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone) have subsided as you may experience withdrawal symptoms.
    

        Injecting the SUBOXONE Film product may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, sleep problems, and cravings.
    

        Before taking SUBOXONE Film, tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider as withdrawal signs and symptoms should be monitored closely and the dose adjusted as necessary. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking SUBOXONE Film, alert your healthcare provider immediately and you should report it using the contact information provided below. *
    

        Opioid‐dependent women on buprenorphine maintenance therapy may require additional analgesia during labor.
    

        Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly.
    

        Before taking SUBOXONE Film, talk to your healthcare provider if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed your baby. The active ingredients of SUBOXONE Film can pass into your breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should consider the development and health benefits of breastfeeding along with your clinical need for SUBOXONE Film and should also consider any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.
    

        Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or perform any other dangerous activities until you know how SUBOXONE Film affects you. Buprenorphine in SUBOXONE Film can cause drowsiness and slow reaction times during dose-adjustment periods.
    

        Common side effects of SUBOXONE Film include nausea, vomiting, drug withdrawal syndrome, headache, sweating, numb mouth, constipation, painful tongue, redness of the mouth, intoxication (feeling lightheaded or drunk), disturbance in attention, irregular heartbeat, decrease in sleep, blurred vision, back pain, fainting, dizziness, and sleepiness.
    
This is not a complete list of potential adverse events associated with SUBOXONE Film. Please see full Prescribing Information for a complete list.
*To report pregnancy or side effects associated with taking SUBOXONE Film, please call 1-877-782-6966. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

For more information about SUBOXONE Film, SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine and naloxone) Sublingual Tablets (CIII), or SUBUTEX® (buprenorphine) Sublingual Tablets (CIII), please see the respective full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide at www.suboxoneREMS.com.

SUBOXONE Film is a prescription medicine that contains the active ingredients buprenorphine and naloxone. It is used to treat adults who are dependent on (addicted to) opioids (either prescription or illegal).
SUBOXONE Film is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.



Treatment should be initiated under the direction of physicians qualified under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act.
Treatment should begin under the supervision of a doctor. In appropriate patients, treatment may continue at home with follow-up visits to a doctor at reasonable intervals.
SUBOXONE Film is intended for administration under the tongue or inside the cheek and is available in four dosage strengths.
SUBOXONE Film contains buprenorphine and naloxone

Buprenorphine is the primary active ingredient in SUBOXONE Film. By attaching to the same receptors as other opioids, it can help to suppress withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings
Naloxone is included to help prevent misuse. If you are dependent on a full opioid agonist and attempt to inject SUBOXONE Film, the naloxone is likely to cause withdrawal signs and symptoms



Selected Safety Information
Do not take SUBOXONE Film if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious negative effects, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.

Indication

        SUBOXONE® (buprenorphine and naloxone) Sublingual Film (CIII) is a prescription medicine indicated for treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.
Treatment should be initiated under the direction of physicians qualified under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act.


Important Safety Information

    Do not take SUBOXONE Film if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious negative effects, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported.


    SUBOXONE Film can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit.


    SUBOXONE Film contains buprenorphine, an opioid that can cause physical dependence with chronic use. Physical dependence is not the same as addiction.
    Your doctor can tell you more about the difference between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not stop taking SUBOXONE Film suddenly without talking to your doctor.
    You could become sick with uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms because your body has become used to this medicine.


    SUBOXONE Film can cause serious life-threatening breathing problems, overdose and death, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines
    or other medications that act on the nervous system (ie, sedatives, tranquilizers, or alcohol). It is extremely dangerous to take nonprescribed benzodiazepines or other medications
    that act on the nervous system while taking SUBOXONE Film.


    You should not drink alcohol while taking SUBOXONE Film, as this can lead to loss of consciousness or even death.


    Death has been reported in those who are not opioid dependent.


    Your doctor may monitor liver function before and during treatment.


    SUBOXONE Film is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. However, SUBOXONE Film
    may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone.


    Keep SUBOXONE Film out of the sight and reach of children. Accidental or deliberate ingestion of SUBOXONE Film by a child can cause severe breathing problems and death.


    Do not take SUBOXONE Film before the effects of other opioids (eg, heroin, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone) have subsided as you may experience withdrawal symptoms.


    Injecting the SUBOXONE Film product may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, sleep problems, and cravings.


    Before taking SUBOXONE Film, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking SUBOXONE Film, alert your doctor
    immediately and you should report it using the contact information provided below.*


    Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit.
    Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS
    and manage accordingly.


    Before taking SUBOXONE Film, talk to your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed your baby. The active ingredients of SUBOXONE Film can pass into your breast milk.
    You and your doctor should consider the development and health benefits of breastfeeding along with your clinical need for SUBOXONE Film and should also consider any potential adverse
    effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.


    Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or perform any other dangerous activities until you know how SUBOXONE Film affects you. Buprenorphine in SUBOXONE Film can cause drowsiness
    and slow reaction times during dose-adjustment periods.


    Common side effects of SUBOXONE Film include nausea, vomiting, drug withdrawal syndrome, headache, sweating, numb mouth, constipation, painful tongue, redness of the mouth, intoxication
    (feeling lightheaded or drunk), disturbance in attention, irregular heartbeat, decrease in sleep, blurred vision, back pain, fainting, dizziness, and sleepiness.


    This is not a complete list of potential adverse events associated with SUBOXONE Film. Please see full Prescribing Information for a complete list.


    *To report negative side effects associated with taking SUBOXONE Film, please call 1‐877‐782‐6966. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1‐800‐FDA‐1088.

Shocking Discover for ... Fibromyalgia Supplements Help Relieve Pain+ Specifically FormulatedHow to Stand Up Against FibromyalgiaJuly 25thAre you suffering from chronic, widespread body discomfort and fatigue? After waking up do you still feel tired and groggy? Do you often find it difficult to focus and concentrate?You're not alone. Everyday millions of Americans suffer these symptoms commonly associated with Fibromyalgia. Chronic, widespread body discomfort robs you of the lifestyle you deserve. It takes a toll on your family, friends, and career, leaving you feeling helpless and frustrated.But what's the solution? There are hundreds of gimmicky products on the market making promises that simply will not be delivered. Many similar products exist under different names, containing cheap ingredients and inadequate doses. The search can be overwhelming and confusing. Where do you turn and who can you trust?That's why a team of nutritional developers set out with a mission to create a single, complete formula to relieve chronic, widespread body discomfort. A product that is simple to use, works fast, and actually helps. The team behind the brand just unveiled the flagship product - Truewell's Fibromyalgia Support.Remarkable opening sales are being recorded and it's manufactured here in the US. The product is so successful due to a simple but innovative idea. Instead of creating a line of multiple products to combat many of the symptoms Fibromyalgia sufferers commonly experience, why not create a balanced all inclusive product that addresses all of these symptoms? No pain killing product, no sleep aid product, no energy product. Just one simple solution.Truewell have accomplished this mission by enclosing natural ingredients into easy to swallow capsules that are taken twice daily. No more dealing with multiple bottles or having to reorder from several different companies to get the relief you need. Truewell is a large supporter of the National Fibromyalgia Association.Relieve and Comfort Your BodyEnjoy Pleasant, Restful SleepFeel Energetic and LivelyBoost Concentration and FocusBenefit the National Fibromyalgia AssociationThere are countless products on the market but few quality brands that deliver what they promise. Truewell's Fibromyalgia Support does just this and has already positioned itself as a national top selling brand. There is no question as to why other companies were skeptical when Truewell launched an all inclusive high-end solution for those suffering from symptoms associated with Fibromyalgia. They had a hard time believing people would pay for a superior first class product. With tons of users reporting stunning results only a few months after its launch, Truewell have proved the cynics wrong.One cannot expect their body to feel good and function properly without supplying it with essential nutrients anymore than they can expect their car to run well without oil. Truewell are well aware that this fact is especially true for those suffering chronic, widespread body discomfort associated with Fibromyalgia. Some added help may be needed for them to live a normal, comfortable life.So what's in Truewell's Fibromyalgia Support that makes it so effective?To start, they included every B vitamin, and vitmains C and D to help provide your body with the basic building blocks. Next, Rhodiola and Quercetin are included as natural, powerful antioxidants. L-Theanine was included to aid in restful sleep. Tumeric root and Zingerber Officinale are well known to quickly crush pain. Adequate doses of all these combined products would cost well over double of what you pay for a bottle of Truewell's Fibromyalgia Support, not to mention how many separate pills you would have to take. Thanks to Truewell, this is no longer necessary to get the relief you deserve. Samples are available online for you to try right now. Sample bottles include a full two weeks supply, are shipped immediately, and usually arrive in just a few days.If you're suffering from chronic, widespread body discomfort commonly associated with Fibromyalgia, then try Truewell's Fibromyalgia Support and feel the relief for yourself.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
