MADISON, N.J., March 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Realogy Holdings Corp. (NYSE:   RLGY) today announced the appointment of Sunita Holzer as executive vice president and chief human resources officer (CHRO). With more than 30 years of experience in the human resources field and over 10 as a CHRO, she has served in HR executive leadership roles for a number of leading companies in the financial services and technology sectors. Holzer will be responsible for all aspects of Realogy's worldwide human resources strategy and implementation for the Company's 10,700 employees. She will report directly to Richard A. Smith, the Company's chairman, chief executive officer and president. 
"Sunita Holzer brings a wealth of strategic human resources leadership experience, and we are pleased to welcome her to Realogy," said Smith. "Her strong background in establishing best-in-class HR governance and practices, along with her expertise in the areas of talent management, succession planning, HR infrastructure and diversity programs, will be an asset to our organization." 
Holzer served as executive vice president and CHRO for Computer Sciences Corporation from 2012 to 2014, where she had oversight of global human resources for 80,000 employees across 60 countries. Previously, Holzer was executive vice president and CHRO at Chubb Insurance from 2003 to 2012. Prior to her tenure at Chubb Insurance, she held executive HR roles at GE Capital, American Express and American International Group. 
Since 2011, Holzer has served as a member of the Board of Directors for South Jersey Industries, an energy services holding company, and as a member of its Compensation and Corporate Responsibility committees. She also serves on the Program Advisory Committee for Re:Gender, a non-profit women's research organization, and is a past member of the Board for Jersey Battered Women's Service.
