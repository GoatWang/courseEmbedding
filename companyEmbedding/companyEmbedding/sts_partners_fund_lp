Q&A: STS Partners Aims To Build On Recent Success
Feb 9 2015  |  2:04pm ET

STS Partners was one of those rare things in 2014: a hedge fund that produced double-digit returns. The Steamboat Springs, Colorado-based firm, which specializes in distressed asset-backed securities, saw its $1.3 billion STS Partners Fund return over 25% last year, ranking third in Bloomberg's Top 100 hedge funds with over $1 billion. Its second fund, the $270 million Burgess Creek, also generated double-digit returns last year, so it will come as no surprise that the firm is preparing to launch new products in 2015. 
To find out more about STS Partners' winning year—and its future plans—FINalternatives recently spoke with Managing Director Will Bashan and Portfolio Manager and CIO Scott Burg.
What is the difference between the Burgess Creek fund and the STS Partners fund (which did very well last year but is closed to new investors)?
Scott BurgBurg: Basically, the difference between the two funds is STS is a much more binary, high-yield, higher risk reward type of scenario...When we were looking at the bonds, you'd have to run the bonds to really see what fit where, and we started to see we were passing up all these bonds that have a little bit more credit enhancement; can actually allow more of a fundamental story to take place; have a longer average life, so they'll be outstanding longer; and we're passing these bonds all up. And we finally said, 'This doesn't make any sense,' because while the current yield on these bonds is lower, the total return component is very attractive. These types of bonds within both residential and commercial mortgages are going to be higher up in the capital structure, they're going to be more liquid, have a little bit more transparency, but what we like about them is they allow the fundamentals to play out over a longer period of time. 
And one of the things that we're really seeing in terms of the fundamentals is we don't necessarily need housing to be increasing at 4%, 6%, 8% a year. Even in a flat housing environment, these bonds are becoming more and more seasoned—the youngest bonds now are 2007, you're going on eight years of seasoning. So what you're left with is a lot of the bad stuff is being flushed through and a lot of the good stuff is left. That's the thesis or the investment premise behind Burgess.
When last we spoke, in 2013, you used the word "phenomenal" to describe the potential of the asset-backed securities market. Would you still describe it that way?
Burg: I would not repeat the word 'phenomenal.' I think in 2013 I was correct: If you would have put $1 billion in the securities we were talking about in 2013, you would be a happy camper. But what I will say about the opportunities is...we have to be more opportunistic in the areas where we're going. So, over the last18 months, we're finding what we see as gems in a lot of different areas. It's not just mortgage-backed, it also could be commercial real estate, one of the things we've been adding is new-issue structured aircraft, backed by aircraft or even aircraft parts; it could be manufacture housing, could be a franchise deal, it could be a CDO, it could be a derivative...We still see very strong opportunities within structured products, but I think now, not only are you betting on the strong horse but...it's very important what jockey you're picking because we've seen a significant run-up in many of these assets and some of them, we see prices that we just don't think are going to be justified by the cashflow. So while there's areas where we're seeing incredible opportunities, at the same time, you're seeing trades that are making you scratch your head.
What is an example of a 'gem' you discovered in 2014?
Burg: One of the things going into 2014, in our macro view, that was definitely against the herd was our view on interest rates throughout 2014. I don't know if that's just being out in Steamboat [laughs] but our view was that interest rates would not only stay low but the whole curve would compress and flatten....So with that macro view about what was going to happen with interest rates, one of the areas that we found that was very undervalued to that expected scenario was the non-agency, interest-only securities. And so that was our major theme throughout 2014. It was wildly successful: Basically, in these securities in the subprime arena, as interest rates come down or flatten out there's more money that goes in to pay these securities; as interest rates go up, there's less money and they perform more poorly. So this was definitely a trade that we put on through 2014 and continue to put on selectively in 2015, that...has had a lot of value.
Can you see Burgess eventually closing to new investors?
Will BashanBashan: Given the strategy and where it is in the capital structure, we could see it closing at some point, but right now that's very far off—it may be $1.5 or $2 billion. But at the end of the day, we approach all our investments and everything we do by letting the market tell us what to do. And so, we don't like to draw a hard line in the sand one way or another, but right now, we're still really excited about the opportunities within Burgess and want to continue to grow the assets.
Do you have any new products planned?
Burg: Yes, there's actually two things that we have on our plate going into 2015. One isn't necessarily different from Burgess, it's going to be a Burgess Creek Irish fund, to allow us to raise money out of Europe and pretty much that whole section of the world. It's going to have a similar strategy to Burgess Creek. The way we're looking at it is that it's a sister fund that allows us access to capital that we otherwise would not be able to get. 
The other opportunity that we're becoming more and more excited about is a single-manager (meaning us) mutual fund...How Burgess Creek came into development, it's kind of the same way with the mutual fund, as we are continuously looking at these bonds and we're saying, 'Wow, this is actually really interesting yield, especially given the world and the world's rate of returns right now,' and you go, 'This doesn't necessarily fit Burgess, but jeez, the right investor would absolutely like this type of return.' And at the same time, we're running these bonds anyway, so we're excited to hopefully be launching that in the summer of 2015.
Bashan: We've been a sub-advisor for a '40 Act fund for about two years...and the strategy has performed very, very well. So what we want to do is roll that out—again, we would just be the sub-advisor, we'd partner with a distribution entity—but we would roll out that strategy that we've had going for now two years so there's already a pretty impressive track record.
Is the Irish fund a way of dealing with Europe's Alternative Investment Fund Manager's Directive?
Bashan: We chose as a firm not to be AIFMD compliant, so that effectively shuts us out of the European market. We actually are going to partner with one of our larger investors that's based in New York and London. They will be AIFMD compliant, they're the ones that will be getting the fund up and running, and we'll be a sub-advisor. So it allows us to do what we do, which is manage the money, and not have the burden of AIFMD to deal with.
Did you consider becoming AIFMD compliant?
Bashan: It's certainly a burden, and it's not something we couldn't handle, but we chose not to because, quite honestly, we see so much opportunity in the U.S. market and other markets that it was just hard to justify the resources for that when we still haven't really tapped into a large part of the U.S. market.
Is the mutual fund an attempt to tap into the growing appetite for liquid alternative products?
Bashan: When you look at today's market environment and yields being so low, we think there's a very high demand for this product—which is basically decent yield, protection against rates rising...Plus, we have a pretty good-sized investor base currently, it's not a '40 Act investor base, naturally, but a lot of our investors would love to have us run a more liquid product, so there's a built-in client base or demand that we can satisfy currently if we have a single-manager type product.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

STS Partners Fund, LP v Deutsche Bank Sec., Inc.

2017 NY Slip Op 03273

Decided on April 27, 2017

Appellate Division, First Department

Published by New York State Law Reporting Bureau pursuant to Judiciary Law § 431.

This opinion is uncorrected and subject to revision before publication in the Official Reports.


Decided on April 27, 2017

Sweeny, J.P., Acosta, Renwick, Moskowitz, Kahn, JJ.

3861 653216/14

[*1]STS Partners Fund, LP, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants-Respondents,
vDeutsche Bank Securities, Inc., et al., Defendants-Respondents, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., etc., Defendant-Respondent-Appellant.


Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP, New York (Michael A. Hanin of counsel), for appellants-respondents.
Alston & Bird LLP, New York (John F. Cambria of counsel), for respondent-appellant.
Jones Day, New York (Jayant W. Tambe of counsel), for respondents.

Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Eileen Bransten, J.), entered June 24, 2016, which, to the extent appealed from, granted the motion of defendants Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. (DB Securities) and Deutsche Mortgage Securities, Inc. (DB Mortgage; together with DB Securities, the DB defendants) to dismiss the supplemental complaint as against them, and granted defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s motion to dismiss all claims except the third cause of action as against it, unanimously modified, on the law, to grant Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss the third cause of action to the extent it is not based on the IRR Threshold, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.
All claims against the DB defendants were correctly dismissed based on the no-action clause in the trust agreements. Quadrant Structured Prods. Co., Ltd. v Vertin (23 NY3d 549 [2014]), which plaintiffs cite, did not involve the termination of a trust. Read in context, the sentence on which plaintiffs rely ("[T]he no-action clause applies when the Trustee is authorized to decide whether to act; it cannot serve as an outright prohibition on a suit filed by a securityholder in the case where the Trustee is without authorization to act" [id. at 567]) means that a no-action clause does not bar claims — such as breach of fiduciary duty against a corporation's board of directors — that an indenture trustee cannot bring. Notably, the Court of Appeals ruled that "those claims sounding in breach of contract and arising from the indenture are barred — requiring the majority securityholders to bring those actions through the Trustee" (id. at 569). The claims that were dismissed included breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and tortious interference with that covenant (id. at 558 n 10). Unlike the claims in Quadrant that were not dismissed, plaintiffs' claims all arise out of the trust agreements and the amendments thereto.
Even if, arguendo, plaintiffs were third-party beneficiaries of the trust agreements (see Walnut Place LLC v Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 35 Misc 3d 1207[A], 2012 NY Slip Op 50601[U], *1 n 2 [Sup Ct, NY County 2012], affd 96 AD3d 684 [1st Dept 2012]), the no-action clause would still apply (see 96 AD3d at 684).
So much of the third cause of action as alleged that Wells Fargo breached the trust agreements by executing the amendments made by it and DB Mortgage was correctly dismissed, because the plain language of section 9.01(a)(v) of the trust agreements permitted those amendments (see generally Quadrant, 25 NY3d at 559-560).
So much of the third cause of action as alleges that certificateholder consent was required to terminate the RS6 trust should also be dismissed, because, as sections 7.01 and 7.03 show, [*2]certificateholder consent was not the only way in which the trust could terminate.
The third cause of action should also be dismissed as against Wells Fargo based on anything other than the IRR Threshold. Both the original and amended trust agreements provide that an auction of the underlying certificates must yield at least the Minimum Auction Call Amount. Of the five components of "Minimum Auction Call Amount," only one — the IRR Threshold — relates to the certificates held by plaintiffs (the Class A-X Certificates).
Plaintiffs contend that, in addition to the IRR Threshold, they had the right to receive a Principal Distribution Amount, a payment under the Cap Agreements, and the Class A-X Distribution Amount for the final month of the RS6 trust's existence. However, the documentary evidence submitted by defendants shows that, as early as December 31, 2007, the Class A-X Certificateholders had received their principal back. The supplemental complaint does not allege that plaintiffs were entitled to any amounts under the Cap Agreements, and plaintiffs may not raise this issue for the first time on appeal, because "the issue might have been obviated by the submission of documentary evidence" (Ta-Chotani v Doubleclick, Inc., 276 AD2d 313 [1st Dept 2000]).
With respect to the Class A-X Distribution Amount, plaintiffs admit that they received distributions from the RS6 trust through August 2014. The trust was terminated on or about September 12, 2014. Hence, there was no Distribution Date on September 28, 2014; by definition, a Class A-X Distribution Amount depends on a Distribution Date. The Final Distribution Date depends on a notice pursuant to section 7.01, which was never delivered.
With respect to the IRR Threshold, Wells Fargo submitted documentary evidence that, as of August 15, 2013, the internal rate of return (IRR) for the RS6 Class A-X Certificates was more than 128% and the IRR for the RS5 Class A-X Certificates was more than 137%. However, the underlying certificates for the RS6 trust were auctioned on September 12, 2014, and the underlying certificates for the RS5 trust were auctioned on October 9, 2015. Since the trust agreements define IRR as an annual rate, the 2013 reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers do not utterly refute plaintiffs' factual allegations or conclusively establish a defense as a matter of law (see e.g. Goshen v Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., 98 NY2d 314, 326 [2002]).
The claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was correctly dismissed as against Wells Fargo, because section 6.01(e)(i) of the trust agreements states, "[N]o implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee" (see Hotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v Mitchell, 63 AD3d 447, 448 [1st Dept 2009]).
Wells Fargo's failure to exercise due care in performing ministerial tasks does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty
(see AG Capital Funding Partners, L.P. v State St. Bank & Trust Co., 11 NY3d 146, 157-158 [2008]). Nor does the supplemental complaint state a cause of action for fiduciary duty based on conflict of interest. While an indenture trustee's "pre-default duty to avoid conflicts of interest . . . is a fiduciary duty" (Commerce Bank v Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 141 AD3d 413, 416 [1st Dept 2016]), plaintiffs made only conclusory allegations that Wells Fargo received more under the RS6 amendment than it would have received under the original trust agreement (see id.). With respect to RS5, defendants explained the amendment's 30 basis points in their opening letter brief, and, as the court noted, plaintiffs failed to respond to this in their opposition letter brief. In any event, the fiduciary duty claim is duplicative of the contract claim (see AG Capital Funding Partners, L.P. v State St. Bank & Trust Co., 40 AD3d 392, 394 [1st Dept 2007], mod on other grounds 11 NY3d 146 [2008]).
We have considered plaintiffs' and Wells Fargo's remaining arguments and find that they do not warrant relief beyond the extent indicated.
THIS CONSTITUTES THE DECISION AND ORDER
OF THE SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT.
ENTERED: APRIL 27, 2017
CLERK

LP Moves Prompt Changes at Deer Park Road
Mortgage-bond investor Deer Park Road Management is adjusting its product mix in response to redemption pressures and shifting investor demand.The $1.9 billion firm is unwinding one of its hedge funds, called Burgess Creek, after a large European investor asked to withdraw $50 million, and is transferring most of the remaining investors to its flagship STS Partners Fund. At the same time, it is tweaking the fee and liquidity terms for STS Partners amid sagging performance.With an annualized return of 24.5% since its 2008 inception, STS has been a bonanza for Deer Park Road. The fund has an unconventional fee structure, with no management fee. Instead, limited partners pay a 60% performance fee on the first 4% of the fund’s profits. The rate drops to a standard 20% of any subsequent profits.But the fund’s returns aren’t what they once were. STS gained 8.8% last year. While that was well above the industry average, it was the first time the fund’s full-year return was below 23%. Until August, STS hadn’t had a down month for 70 consecutive months. But year-to-date, it is down 2.1% as of April 30.That helps explain why Deer Park Road is reopening STS to outside investors for the first time in four years and amending the fees and liquidity terms applicable to new investments — including the assets moving over from the now-unwinding Burgess Creek. Newcomers will pay the industry-standard 2% management fee and 20% performance fee. They’ll also be subject to a one-year “soft” lockup, during which they’d have to pay a 5% penalty on any withdrawals. Burgess Creek investors had been used to a monthly redemption schedule.The changes apparently aren’t sitting well with some investors. Limited partners representing nearly three-quarters of the capital in Burgess Creek have opted to transfer to STS. Most of the rest have asked the manager to liquidate their assets — a process that’s expected to take months, considering that Deer Park Road specializes in illiquid “odd lot” mortgage-backed securities.“I know that some investors in Burgess Creek didn’t want to wait . . . for their money back, nor did they want distribution in kind, so they planned to move from Burgess to STS and then immediately redeem from STS hoping that they could get out faster when part of the larger fund,” a source said. “They’re not waiting for the lockup to be over. They’d rather pay the redemption fee and get money ASAP.”But a source close to the Steamboat Springs, Colo., firm said most Burgess Creek investors were eager to transfer to STS and so far have shown no signs of wanting to withdraw. “No one has done that,” he said. “I’d be very surprised at that.”Still, STS has been hit by redemption requests including $82 million for April and $75 million for May. It is bracing for another $86 million of withdrawals in June and about $50 million in July. The fund had $1.5 billion under management as of March 31.“It should be noted that while the pace of redemptions has increased somewhat in the near term, this has not presented any change to our portfolio-management strategy,” the firm wrote in an investor letter distributed last month. “Of note: through the first three months of the year, the balance of redemptions, back-fill contributions and cashflow on the portfolio holdings has generated a positive increase of approximately $40 million. While the coming periods account for some incremental increase in outflows, they represent a relatively small portion of the overall fund size and are mitigated by the increase in portfolio cashflows.”In reopening STS, Deer Park Road hopes to raise $250 million to $500 million — in addition to the assets transferring from Burgess Creek. So far, it has taken in $10 million of fresh capital.Deer Park Road launched Burgess Creek in 2013 to offer investors a less-volatile version of its STS strategy. While nearly 70% of Burgess Creek’s positions also are held by STS, the balance of its holdings are higher-rated mortgage securities that tend to be more liquid. Through April, Burgess Creek was showing an annualized return of 6.6%. But year-to-date, it was down 4.5%.In December 2015, a Danish pension began withdrawing its entire $50 million investment from Burgess Creek. At the time, the fund had a little more than $300 million. As a result of the redemption, which was to be executed over six months, other investors would have held increasingly large percentages of the fund. That, coupled with investor demand for STS, was enough for Deer Park Road to pull the plug on Burgess Creek. In doing so, it offered limited partners three exit options: transferring to STS, liquidating their stakes over 12-18 months, or receiving in-kind payments of assets. Only one investor opted for a payment in kind.The changes to STS’ fee and liquidity terms were designed to make the fund more attractive to pension consultants and other advisors to institutional investors. They have shied away from STS due in part to the perception of a liquidity mismatch between the underlying assets and the fund’s monthly redemption schedule. There also was a concern that without a management fee, the firm might be vulnerable to periods of low or negative returns.Several sources suggested Deer Park Road may have had an ulterior motive in ushering Burgess Creek investors to STS. Because the funds have similar portfolios, liquidating Burgess Creek could have dented the values of the underlying securities, which in turn would have hurt the performance of STS.The maneuver also has rekindled skepticism among some observers about the ability of STS to generate such consistently strong returns. “The firm has too perfect of a return profile since its 2008 launch,” one source said.Deer Park Road is led by founder Michael Craig-Scheckman and chief investment officer Scott Burg. Craig-Scheckman previously was a portfolio manager at Millennium Management. Before joining Deer Park Road, Burg co-founded an asset-valuation shop called Clayton IPS, now known as MountainView IPS. Among MountainView’s clients is Deer Park Road. Scott Gibson, who became head of marketing for Deer Park Road earlier this year, previously worked at MountainView IPS.
