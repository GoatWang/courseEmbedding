I had another attorney that had addressed some issues in our custody case, but a conflict would not let me call that office.  I called Shane Neese and ended up with the perfect attorney.  He guided us though a very complicated case with his knowledge and professionalism, and with his steady hand, kept me on track.  If you need an attorney, we highly recommend Shane Neese.Denison & Denison PC15pieces-of-flare ratedVery Honest, Christian Attorne...Very Honest, Christian Attorneys ready to help you. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Some divorce cases are relatively straightforward and amicable. Other cases are contentious and require significant work to resolve the major issues. In any case, we will provide an approach that is tailored to fit your situation.Child SupportMatters involving child support tend to be relatively straightforward. There are clear guidelines in place that outline how support payments are to be calculated, with the income of both parents being the primary consideration. However, every case is unique with its own set of factors that must be addressed. Our Alabama child support lawyers can help guide you through this process and will explore all of your options.Child Custody and VisitationMatters involving custody and visitation can be some of the most difficult and contentious issues to resolve during a divorce. That is why the Alabama child custody attorneys at the Law Offices of Dean & Barrett will work closely with you to reach a resolution that is designed to meet the best interests of your children.AdoptionOur attorneys also help families come together through adoptions. We can assist with any type of private or agency adoption, including stepparent adoptions, grandparent adoptions and adoptions involving unmarried couples.Premarital AgreementNo one enters a marriage expecting it to end in divorce. However, when one or both individuals entering a marriage have substantial assets, it is important to plan for the unexpected and protect your financial interests through premarital agreements. At Dean & Barrett, we draft and review prenuptial agreements that protect our clients in the event of a future divorce.GuardianshipWhen individuals are no longer able to manage their financial affairs or properly care for themselves, it may be necessary for family members or friends to step in and establish conservatorships and guardianships.Spousal SupportLegal SeparationIf your marriage is at an end and you want to explore your legal separation options, we are here to help. Contact our Auburn divorce lawyers online or call us at 334-787-9991 for a free initial consultation to discuss your situation.Child AbuseProperty LawPremises LiabilityIf you or someone you care about has been involved in an accident on someone else's property, you may have a premises liability case. Whether the accident took place on a commercial property or a neighbor's house, you may be able to pursue compensation for medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages and other costs.Eminent DomainThe power of eminent domain gives cities, states and other bodies of government the right to purchase your land. However, they have to pay you just compensation.Health LawPersonal InjuryFrom personal injury litigation to alcohol and drug-related offenses, our team can handle a wide range of legal issues.Auto AccidentsDog BitesIf an accident happened due to negligence at a grocery store, bar, restaurant, department store, gas station or even at someone else's home, our lawyers can stand by your side to pursue results that matter to you.Trusts and EstatesProbateEstate PlanningEveryone can benefit from a simple estate plan. No matter what stage of life you are in â€” from new parent to grandparent â€” a few simple estate planning documents can help protect your family and preserve your assets for the next generation.WillsTrustsPower of AttorneyOur lawyers also help clients prepare powers of attorney and health care directives that name responsible and trusted friends of family members to make financial and health care-related decisions for them when they are no longer able to make decisions on their own.Criminal LawInternet CrimesCriminal DefenseWith more than 40 years of experience providing criminal defense in municipal, state and federal courts, we know exactly what to do to protect your rights.DUI/DWIDrivers who have been convicted of multiple DUIs face increasingly serious charges. As the number of DUI convictions increase, so do the penalties. In Alabama, if you have been charged with your fourth DUI, you are facing felony charges.Wrongful DeathIf you lost a loved one in an accident, there is help. In Alabama, spouses and dependent children can bring wrongful death claims to recover compensation for the financial injuries caused by the death of their loved ones.Traffic ViolationsTruck wreck cases are unique. More often than not, our attorneys find out that the accident was caused because a truck driver decided not to obey state and federal regulations that govern the industry. Maybe they spent too much time on the road and fell asleep at the wheel. Maybe they were speeding.Sex CrimesNo matter what you have been accused of, you can be confident that we can put forward an aggressive defense.FraudRobberyBurglaryIf you have been accused of theft or burglary, you are facing serious, possibly felony-level, criminal charges. A guilty verdict will not only bring steep fines and jail time; it will leave a permanent mark on your criminal record.White Collar CrimesIf you or your company is suspected of wrongdoing, you need experienced white collar defense attorneys. At Dean & Barrett, our attorneys have the experience to successfully defend clients against a wide range of white collar crimes, including...TheftMisdemeanorsIn Alabama, it is illegal to possess controlled substances.

Together, we will build a strategic legal defense that protects your rights and preserves your freedom.Restraining OrderAt Dean & Barrett, we help clients defend against domestic violence charges and represent individuals accused of violating existing restraining orders.ForgeryMany college students see fake IDs as harmless documents that allow them to patron bars with their older, 21-year old friends. What most don't realize is that fake IDs are forged documents, and making or possessing these fake IDs can expose them to criminal forgery charges.KidnappingManslaughterVehicular manslaughter is a felony in Alabama. If convicted, you are facing large fines and years in prison. A felony conviction will also permanently mark your criminal record, making it difficult to obtain employment and gain entry into graduate school.Send to PhoneBarrett, J Tutt457 S 10th St, Opelika, AL 36801(334) 749-2429Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailBarrett, J Tutt457 S 10th St, Opelika, AL 36801(334) 749-2429Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
