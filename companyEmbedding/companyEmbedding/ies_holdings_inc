The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

IES Holdings Announces Agreement to Acquire Technibus, Inc.

HOUSTON, June  02, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IES Holdings, Inc. (or "IES") (NASDAQ:IESC) today announced that a wholly-owned subsidiary of IES has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the shares of stock of Technibus, Inc. ("Technibus"), a Canton, Ohio-based manufacturer of custom-engineered, metal enclosed bus duct solutions, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $45 million.  Upon completion of the transaction, Technibus will operate as a subsidiary in IES's Infrastructure Solutions segment and will continue to operate under the Technibus name.  The transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks, subject to

original equipment manufacturing companies and engineering, procurement and construction companies.  We expect the acquisition of Technibus will add valuable capabilities to our Infrastructure Solutions segment and broaden its solutions offering to both Technibus and current IES customers."  Mike Rice, President of IES's Infrastructure Solutions segment, added, "The acquisition of Technibus will transform Infrastructure Solutions from a business primarily focused on industrial repairs and services to a trusted provider of custom engineered solutions to our customers.  Technibus' superior products and engineering expertise, combined with Infrastructure Solutions' service capabilities, a shared customer base, and close geographic proximity to our segment's Massillon, 
Ohio headquarters, will significantly enhance our solutions offering."   Dinsmore & Shohl LLP is serving as legal advisor to IES.  The investment banking firm Fidus Securities, LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Technibus on this transaction.
