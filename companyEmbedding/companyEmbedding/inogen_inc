Inogen Oxygen Concentrators for Sale 



2. How to Rent a Portable Oxygen Concentrator through Medicare / Insurance
The Inogen One G3 is covered by Medicare, so if your physician has prescribed oxygen therapy and you are eligible for Medicare coverage, you may qualify to get the Inogen One G3 portable oxygen concentrator you need for little to no additional cost.*
Many insurance plans, including Medicare, will cover up to 80% of the cost for your oxygen therapy equipment, provided your test results show that you require oxygen therapy. Medicare’s coverage policies vary slightly from region to region and also private insurance coverage varies from company to company – Inogen will work directly with your doctor, Medicare, and your Insurance Company to see if the Inogen One G3 portable oxygen concentrator is right for you.
We have thousands of oxygen users across the country that have already received the Inogen One G3 portable oxygen machine through Medicare or private insurance (portable oxygen concentrator rental). Join our growing family and see if you’re eligible to reclaim your freedom and independence at little or no additional cost!*
Steps to rent an Inogen One G3 through insurance**:
Step 1: 
First, we’ll check your eligibility with Medicare or your Insurance Company. Call us at 1-800-678-5572.
Step 2: 
Next, if you’re eligible, we’ll work directly with your doctor to see if the Inogen One is right for you and obtain the required paperwork.
Step 3: 
Then, you’ll receive the Inogen One System and a backup oxygen supply.
Step 4: 
Next, we’ll test your oxygen levels with one of our staff nurses or respiratory therapists to make sure the Inogen One is meeting your needs defined by your doctor.
Step 5:
After you return the Medicare/Insurance paperwork, the last step is to remove your current oxygen equipment and to finally say goodbye to all those tanks. At that point you’ll be on service with Inogen and part of our growing family.
* Co-payment and deductibles may apply. Inogen One G4 system not available through Medicare or insurance.
** For Medicare/Insurance orders.

About Inogen 


									share:
								








Inogen’s mission to improve the quality of life of supplemental oxygen users began in 2001 when Mae, a beloved Grandmother, was prescribed oxygen therapy.
Learn more about Mae’s Story
Inogen was founded based on our conviction that oxygen therapy technology was not keeping pace with the desired lifestyles of patients who depended on it to live longer, more fulfilling lives.  We estimate that more than 2.5 million patients in the United States and more than 4.5 million patients worldwide use oxygen therapy.
Our compact, lightweight and travel-approved portable oxygen concentrators are designed to free patients from heavy tanks, managing tank refills or being tethered to stationary systems. We believe our products allow oxygen therapy patients to reclaim their freedom and independence so that life can be lived in moments, not in minutes left in an oxygen tank.  With each step we take to improve our products and service, our customers take another step toward more freedom.

OUR MISSION STATEMENT

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Inogen G4 Portable Oxygen Concentrator Product Number: IS-400




 
Inogen One G4 is a lightweight portable oxygen concentrator made by one of the top manufacturers. The combined weight of the carry bag, the Inogen One G4 concentrator and battery is less than 4 pounds, making the Inogen G4 less cumbersome to carry along. Its small size and low weight reduces fatique and allows you to be more discreet about being an oxygen user. The Inogen One G4 provides pulse flow oxygen in a selectable range of 1 to 3 with an average sound of only 40 decibels, significantly less than human conversation which averages 60 decibels. Small, lightweight and hard to notice makes this portable machine a top competitor for the pulse flow oxygen market.
Inogen One G4 technology incorporates dual exhausts and dual intakes, providing maximum heat dissipation to keep your O2 device running cooler and longer. This machine can operate from three separate power sources--battery, DC power (car, truck, RV, boat), or AC power from your home. AC power is also used to recharge the battery. The Inogen One G4 machine is designed to operate 24/7 to meet the needs of the oxygen patient. You may select between two Inogen One battery options—the standard single battery or the upgraded double battery. The Inogen One double battery lasts twice as long as the Inogen One single battery between recharges.

Inogen G4 Portable Oxygen Concentrator Product Number: IS-400




 
Inogen One G4 is a lightweight portable oxygen concentrator made by one of the top manufacturers. The combined weight of the carry bag, the Inogen One G4 concentrator and battery is less than 4 pounds, making the Inogen G4 less cumbersome to carry along. Its small size and low weight reduces fatique and allows you to be more discreet about being an oxygen user. The Inogen One G4 provides pulse flow oxygen in a selectable range of 1 to 3 with an average sound of only 40 decibels, significantly less than human conversation which averages 60 decibels. Small, lightweight and hard to notice makes this portable machine a top competitor for the pulse flow oxygen market.
Inogen One G4 technology incorporates dual exhausts and dual intakes, providing maximum heat dissipation to keep your O2 device running cooler and longer. This machine can operate from three separate power sources--battery, DC power (car, truck, RV, boat), or AC power from your home. AC power is also used to recharge the battery. The Inogen One G4 machine is designed to operate 24/7 to meet the needs of the oxygen patient. You may select between two Inogen One battery options—the standard single battery or the upgraded double battery. The Inogen One double battery lasts twice as long as the Inogen One single battery between recharges.

Can I use a car charger from my Invacare XP unit on my Inogen G3 unit that I recently bought?  They plugs fit alright but afraid to use in case I can damage my Inogen unit.  Also, what do those aluminum cylinder filters filter on my G3 unit?  I' m getting an "Oxygen Low" reading  on my LED screen fairly often now, will changing the cylinder filters help this?  



Question by: Lee Greenwood on Jun 12, 2016 12:57:40 PM



The unit's may have enough of a difference between them that using a connection with parts from a different machine could alter it. If you're getting a low oxygen indication it's best to contact the manufacturer for troubleshooting. If they are unable to help you, give us a call at 800-397-5899 so we can help you process a warranty claim.

Good service, good price. Possibly not highest quality
I was relieved to find the output filters for my mother's Inogen  One G2 concentrator. But they are of a paper product, where the original was a more sturdy (and perhaps more porous) plastic-like material. Not confident they are doing the job; mom needs to inhale more forcefully to get the "no breath detected" warning to turn off.

Purchase of filters
After searching other sites to purchase filters for my Inogen One G3, I found that your company had the lowest price for the  filters.  I was impressed by the speed at which they were delivered to me also!  I will order from you again in the future!

Can I use a car charger from my Invacare XP unit on my Inogen G3 unit that I recently bought?  They plugs fit alright but afraid to use in case I can damage my Inogen unit.  Also, what do those aluminum cylinder filters filter on my G3 unit?  I' m getting an "Oxygen Low" reading  on my LED screen fairly often now, will changing the cylinder filters help this?  



Question by: Lee Greenwood on Jun 12, 2016 12:57:40 PM



The unit's may have enough of a difference between them that using a connection with parts from a different machine could alter it. If you're getting a low oxygen indication it's best to contact the manufacturer for troubleshooting. If they are unable to help you, give us a call at 800-397-5899 so we can help you process a warranty claim.

Good service, good price. Possibly not highest quality
I was relieved to find the output filters for my mother's Inogen  One G2 concentrator. But they are of a paper product, where the original was a more sturdy (and perhaps more porous) plastic-like material. Not confident they are doing the job; mom needs to inhale more forcefully to get the "no breath detected" warning to turn off.

Purchase of filters
After searching other sites to purchase filters for my Inogen One G3, I found that your company had the lowest price for the  filters.  I was impressed by the speed at which they were delivered to me also!  I will order from you again in the future!

More frequent beeps indicate higher priority conditions.Backlight: A backlight will illuminate the screen for 15 seconds when the on/off button is briefly pressed. Operating Instructions:Place the Inogen One G4 in a well ventilated location. Air intake and exhaust must have clear access. Locate the Inogen One G4 in such a way that any auditory alerts may be heard. Always operate the Inogen One G4 in an upright position.Ensure particle filter is in place.

Additional titration may be needed to ensure proper oxygen delivery when using a particular cannula.Turn on your Inogen One G4 by pressing the ON/OFF Button. A single short beep will sound after the Inogen logo is displayed. “Please Wait” will appear while the portable concentrator starts up. The display will indicate the selected flow setting and power condition. Following a brief start-up sequence, a warm up period up to 2 minutes will initiate. During this time period the oxygen concentration is building to but may not have reached specification. Additional warm up time may be needed if your Inogen One G4 has been stored in extremely cold temperatures.Set the Inogen One G4 Concentrator to the flow rate prescribed by your physician or clinician. Use the + or – setting buttons to adjust the Inogen One G4 to the desired setting. The current setting can be viewed on the display.Position the nasal cannula on your face and breathe through your nose. Inogen One G4 will sense the onset of inhalation and deliver a burst of oxygen at a precise time when you inhale. The Inogen One G4 will sense each breath and continue to deliver oxygen in this manner.

A single short beep will sound after the Inogen logo is displayed. “Please Wait” will appear while the portable concentrator starts up. The display will indicate the selected flow setting and power condition. Following a brief start-up sequence, a warm up period up to 2 minutes will initiate. During this time period the oxygen concentration is building to but may not have reached specification.

Inogen One G3 Portable Oxygen Concentrator Details







Inogen One G3 is a portable oxygen concentrator that weighs 5.25 pounds, including the standard battery and carry case. The lightweight and small design of the G3 Concentrator allows the freedom and independence that they are missing when using traditional oxygen therapy devices. This portable oxygen concentrator can be used for stationary oxygen, portable oxygen and for traveling. Approved by the FAA for airline travel, the Inogen G3 Concentrator is can be powered from three separate power sources. These power sources include a rechargeable lithium ion battery,  AC power from your home or office, or DC power from your car, boat, or RV.  The AC power supply is auto sensing, allowing worldwide use when traveling. The oxygen flow is pulse dose with five settings from 1 to 5. Oxygen concentration levels are from 87 to 96 percent with a maximum flow of 840 mL. Noise output is a modest 39 decibels. The G3 Oxygen Concentrator is 24/7 capable for both day and night while on extended vacations.

Its small size is easier to carry than most of its competitors. Manufactured by Inogen, the G3 is sleeker and more efficient than the older and very popular G2. (pictured to the left in a comparison with the G3). The G3 employs breath detecting pulse flow oxygen, which optimally conserves energy usage and time between recharging.
Inogen One G3 Oxygen Concentrator provides Sleep Mode Technology that adapts to individual patient needs. Replace your cumbersome and heavy oxygen tanks that constantly need refilling with an Oxygen Concentrator that can operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when you need it.

Inogen G3 Portable Oxygen Concentrator Review (2:44 minutes)
  

Video Transcription
Dr. Kennedy: We all live with an image of ourselves as we were, not always as we are. Admitting to infirmities is succumbing to our and infirmities. 
I love golf. I've been playing golf since I was 10 years old, and that's my ultimate goal is to be able to go back down to the golf course practice range and make the golf ball do what I could make it do in years past. Just supplemental oxygen, you know, is critically important to reach the goal I have for myself. 
I went to the internet and I discovered that there were indeed lighter units which were truly portable and ultimately came to Inogen. The portable concentrator weights four-and-a-half pounds. The big unit I use at night is something that my wife and I can pick up and move around if we need to. Everything was more compact. Everything was simpler in terms of manipulation of the controls and it has been a godsend - physically something I can use when I need it. 
Craig: When we started, Peter {Dr. Kennedy} really had difficulty, even just walking a block or two down the road on a general walk. I believe the Inogen One product has been tremendous impact on Peter and our ability to work out. Its lightweight, we've had it on our walks. Sometimes we even do some, what I would say, a "hurry-up" and more spring-like walk. We've had in the pool. We've had here shadow boxing. With the Inogen product, we've been able to increase that from baseline of 55 to 60 seconds on around anywhere between 80 to 90 seconds.
Dr. Kennedy: I couldn't be happier. As a consumer I'm delighted. I got a new set of golf clubs that I bought six months ago and I'm gonna use them.

This product is only for those not needing 24/7 oxygen.
We bought this hoping to be free of carrying bottles while out and about.  This would be ideal for those not needing oxygen 24/7.  While out I had to drag bottles out and put on constant flow, this did not put enough oxygen out. We tried to use this little concentrator on a small trip.  I ended up taking my mother in to doctor, she was not getting enough air, try to walk. almost pass out.  The Pulmonologist said he would NEVER recommend the Inogen One G3 for a patient that can not go without good flow oxygen.  Returning Product.

Vitality Medical - Inogen one G3
What an improvement over other alternatives! We use a portable concentrator for travel, and the small size and long battery life transformed our logistics for travel to Europe. The battery life was as advertized, and the small size and weight of both the unit and the batteries made our trip so much easier compared to other portable units. Want also to say that Vitality Medical was outstanding. They were out of stock when we ordered, and went the extra mile to ensure that we got a unit before our trip.

Outstanding!!!!!!
We have used the Inogen One GE for a couple of weeks and find it to be a true blessing to our lives.  We now have such great mobility and ease of getting around due to the light weight of this machine.  It is so very quiet and so easy to use.  We really enjoy the ability to plug it into the car power outlet and have it provide oxygen while recharging the battery.  Every single reservation we had about purchasing such a machine has been completely swept away by this truly marvelous oxygen concentrator.

Excellent product.
I am very pleased with the oxygen concentrator it functions well and has given me the freedom to go and do as I please.
Being able to use it on AC at home and DC in the car and batteries when shopping and other outside activities makes it indispensable to me.  Not to mention the great price from Vitality!

Inogen One G3 Portable Oxygen Concentrator Details







Inogen One G3 is a portable oxygen concentrator that weighs 5.25 pounds, including the standard battery and carry case. The lightweight and small design of the G3 Concentrator allows the freedom and independence that they are missing when using traditional oxygen therapy devices. This portable oxygen concentrator can be used for stationary oxygen, portable oxygen and for traveling. Approved by the FAA for airline travel, the Inogen G3 Concentrator is can be powered from three separate power sources. These power sources include a rechargeable lithium ion battery,  AC power from your home or office, or DC power from your car, boat, or RV.  The AC power supply is auto sensing, allowing worldwide use when traveling. The oxygen flow is pulse dose with five settings from 1 to 5. Oxygen concentration levels are from 87 to 96 percent with a maximum flow of 840 mL. Noise output is a modest 39 decibels. The G3 Oxygen Concentrator is 24/7 capable for both day and night while on extended vacations.
G3 Portable Oxygen Concentrator is one of the lightest and smallest portable concentrators on the market. The concentrator by itself weighs only 3-1/2 pounds. Its small size is easier to carry than most of its competitors. Manufactured by Inogen, the G3 is sleeker and more efficient than the older and very popular G2. (pictured to the left in a comparison with the G3). The G3 employs breath detecting pulse flow oxygen, which optimally conserves energy usage and time between recharging.
Inogen One G3 Oxygen Concentrator provides Sleep Mode Technology that adapts to individual patient needs. Replace your cumbersome and heavy oxygen tanks that constantly need refilling with an Oxygen Concentrator that can operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when you need it.

Inogen G3 Portable Oxygen Concentrator Review (2:44 minutes)
  

Video Transcription
Dr. Kennedy: We all live with an image of ourselves as we were, not always as we are. Admitting to infirmities is succumbing to our and infirmities. 
I love golf. I've been playing golf since I was 10 years old, and that's my ultimate goal is to be able to go back down to the golf course practice range and make the golf ball do what I could make it do in years past. Just supplemental oxygen, you know, is critically important to reach the goal I have for myself. 
I went to the internet and I discovered that there were indeed lighter units which were truly portable and ultimately came to Inogen. The portable concentrator weights four-and-a-half pounds. The big unit I use at night is something that my wife and I can pick up and move around if we need to. Everything was more compact. Everything was simpler in terms of manipulation of the controls and it has been a godsend - physically something I can use when I need it. 
Craig: When we started, Peter {Dr. Kennedy} really had difficulty, even just walking a block or two down the road on a general walk. I believe the Inogen One product has been tremendous impact on Peter and our ability to work out. Its lightweight, we've had it on our walks. Sometimes we even do some, what I would say, a "hurry-up" and more spring-like walk. We've had in the pool. We've had here shadow boxing. With the Inogen product, we've been able to increase that from baseline of 55 to 60 seconds on around anywhere between 80 to 90 seconds.
Dr. Kennedy: I couldn't be happier. As a consumer I'm delighted. I got a new set of golf clubs that I bought six months ago and I'm gonna use them.

This product is only for those not needing 24/7 oxygen.
We bought this hoping to be free of carrying bottles while out and about.  This would be ideal for those not needing oxygen 24/7.  While out I had to drag bottles out and put on constant flow, this did not put enough oxygen out. We tried to use this little concentrator on a small trip.  I ended up taking my mother in to doctor, she was not getting enough air, try to walk. almost pass out.  The Pulmonologist said he would NEVER recommend the Inogen One G3 for a patient that can not go without good flow oxygen.  Returning Product.

Vitality Medical - Inogen one G3
What an improvement over other alternatives! We use a portable concentrator for travel, and the small size and long battery life transformed our logistics for travel to Europe. The battery life was as advertized, and the small size and weight of both the unit and the batteries made our trip so much easier compared to other portable units. Want also to say that Vitality Medical was outstanding. They were out of stock when we ordered, and went the extra mile to ensure that we got a unit before our trip.

Outstanding!!!!!!
We have used the Inogen One GE for a couple of weeks and find it to be a true blessing to our lives.  We now have such great mobility and ease of getting around due to the light weight of this machine.  It is so very quiet and so easy to use.  We really enjoy the ability to plug it into the car power outlet and have it provide oxygen while recharging the battery.  Every single reservation we had about purchasing such a machine has been completely swept away by this truly marvelous oxygen concentrator.

Excellent product.
I am very pleased with the oxygen concentrator it functions well and has given me the freedom to go and do as I please.
Being able to use it on AC at home and DC in the car and batteries when shopping and other outside activities makes it indispensable to me.  Not to mention the great price from Vitality!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
