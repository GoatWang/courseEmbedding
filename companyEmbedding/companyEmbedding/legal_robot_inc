Robotics “THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS” – Web Movie –





Robotics

				Hitachi’s robotics contributes to society in various areas
            





					Hitachi develops a wide variety of robots integrated with an IoT platform to improve people’s lives.
				





                        IoT has accelerated co-creation between companies and has helped create new value. But in order to leverage the full potential of IoT, data processing must go beyond cyberspace. New and innovative services in the real world will depend on our ability to combine data with physical operations. That’s why robotics will play such a crucial role moving forward, as they become our bridge between the real and virtual worlds.
					

						At Hitachi, we’ve developed a wide range of robots for various applications by leveraging our expertise in operational technologies (OT). But we’re not developing technologies without reason. We’re implementing social innovation. By integrating robots with IoT platforms, and using that technology in social infrastructures, we’re actively promoting initiatives to improve people’s lives.
					










Humanoid Robot "EMIEW3" and Robotics IT Platform for Customer Services （Short Version） - Hitachi






EMIEW3 is a human symbiotic robot that aggregates data obtained from various external sensors.
Information necessary for providing services is then processed over a cloud-based robotics IT platform and fed back to the robot – helping it navigate, communicate, and interact with its surroundings.This IT infrastructure can also be integrated with existing operational systems to provide business intelligence by processing various kinds of relevant information. We also offer business solutions with interconnected robots.






					At Hitachi, we’ve been developing robotics technology for over half a century, while focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value.
                





						The history of Hitachi Group’s robotics dates back to the 1960s with our Servo-Manipulator, a remote controlled device for nuclear power plant operations.Since then, Hitachi has introduced a wide variety of robots – from mechatronic products, such as semiconductor testing equipment and financial devices, to robots for extreme environments like nuclear power plants.

						With Hitachi’s R&D focusing on the development of automatic control and intelligent processing, our advanced robotics has served as the vehicle bringing these technologies to life.In 2005, Hitachi became one of the first companies to develop a human symbiotic robot. Rolling out improved functions in phases with new elemental technologies, by 2016 Hitachi proudly introduced EMIEW3, a service-assistance robot that can talk and work with people.
                    





                    We’re also focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value. Currently, we’re actively setting up new facilities for conducting demonstration experiments, with multiple collaborative spaces already in operation to implement high-quality prototyping alongside our clients.
				




                    The proliferation of IoT in recent years has seen a wide array of information and knowledge stored in cyberspace. This shift has also made real-world applications of digital solutions increasingly realistic through robotics.
                    As we develop robotics solutions for the age of IoT, we’ll continue to drive social innovation forward, solving today’s challenges for a better future.
				




Hitachi has developed a wide variety of robotsthat offer new value to customers.





EMIEW3 is a Human Symbiotic Robot that Actively Communicates with People
EMIEW3 draws from Hitachi’s extensive expertise in robotics and digital solutions to realize a high level of autonomy. A cloud-based IT infrastructure serves as a “remote brain”, which monitors and controls the robot’s body. This brain connected with the robot’s body in real time also gives EMIEW3 the ability to communicate, navigate through its surroundings, and provide customer support and guidance.By accurately understanding situations in various service settings, EMIEW3 is able to recognize and approach those in need. It can even start up a conversation on its own to provide services — improving user satisfaction and  business efficiency.
								

								*For the practical application,EMIEW3 is conducting a demonstration test.

ROPITS is a Single-Passenger Mobility Support Robot that Autonomously Travels on Sidewalks
ROPITS is a single-passenger mobility support robot that features autonomous transportation. ROPITS can be summoned easily from anywhere in the city using a map on a mobile information device. Once summoned, ROPITS autonomously travels to the designated point to pick up and transport passengers to their destination. It automatically avoids obstacles through a 3D environmental recognition technology integrating multiple sensors. It also has active suspensions mounted onboard, which give it stability even on winding or uneven paths. We expect ROPITS to help the elderly and those with difficulty walking to support short-distance trips.

								*For the practical application,ROPITS is conducting a demonstration test.

The Autonomous Mobile Dual Arm Robot that’s Pioneering the Future of Logistics
Consumer needs are becoming increasingly diversified, and logistics is becoming even more complex as a result. While these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations, current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work, which limits their application.At Hitachi, we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses. Equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms, this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments. It also includes a gripper that automates manual operations, such as pulling out shelves and picking out products.The dual arm robot uses built-in sensors to understand its own position and the location of products that need to be picked. While in motion, it can also identify specific products before picking them out from the shelves.But there’s more to this robot than order picking. With its dual arms, this advanced technology can also complete complex tasks that require coordination between two arms.With the advancement of our automation technologies, the future of logistics is closer than ever.  
*The autonomous mobile dual arm robot is still in its development stages and it is yet to be determined when it will be put to practical use.

To receive these protections, website owners must comply with many conditions, including “notice and takedown” procedures, and registration with the USCO. Without these protections, the risk of potential copyright liability would prevent many useful websites from existing.Who needs this?Anyone that runs a website in the US and allows people to upload content (blog comments, articles, photos, videos, etc.) that risks 3rd party copyright infringement.What are the new rules?On December 1st, 2016, the US Copyright Office switched from a paper-based registration system to a digital system. The lowered processing fees by more than 90%, but now require re-registration every three years and are applying more scrutiny to keep information current. Most importantly, any Designated Agent registrations before December 1st, 2016 will be invalidated at the end of 2017. Everyone who had this protection must now re-register or this important litigation shield goes away.© 2017 Legal Robot, Inc. | Events | Legal | Press | Security | Swag!

Robots Law and Legal Definition







 
A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to
move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through various programmed
motions for the performance of a variety of tasks. The word 'robot' was
coined by the Czech playwright Karel Capek from the Czech word for forced
labor or serf.
The term 'robotics' refers to the study and use of robots. The first
industrial modern robots were the Unimates developed by George Devol and
Joe Engelberger in the late 50's and early 60's. The first patents were
by Devol for parts transfer machines. Engelberger has been called the 'father
of robotics' due to his founding of Unimation and being the first to market
robots.

Legal Robot - AI for LawKnow what you sign™Understand legal languageAutomate legal processesSIGN UP NOWEnsure Fairness.    Improve Transparency.    Sign With Confidence.INSTANT ERROR CHECKOur automated contract review helps you understand complex legal language and spot problems before you sign, without the time and cost of hiring an attorney.COMPARE & COLLABORATEEvaluate your contract against standards and across industries or jurisdictions, then collaborate with your team of legal professionals throughout negotiation.FAIRNESS & RISK ANALYSISOur algorithms assess fairness and risk so all parties can be clear on the terms and confident about what they are signing.INTELLIGENT LEGAL ANALYTICSNatural Language UnderstandingLegal Robot transforms complex legal language into numeric expressions, where statistical and machine learning techniques can derive meaning. We combine each layer to form higher level concepts from words to sentences to themes. Legal Robot continuously compares thousands of documents to build a legal language model that we use to continuously expand our legal language analysis.Artificial IntelligenceLegal Robot enhances or entirely replaces traditional legal processes like contract reviews with an automated intelligent assistant. Using the legal language model, the intelligent assistant flags issues and suggests improvements by considering best practices, risk factors, and jurisdictional differences.INSTANT DOCUMENT REVIEWERROR CHECKFind and fix costly legal issuesLegal Robot gives you an instant error check for contracts and helps you write better legal documents. Our software breaks down legal language and explains it in a way we can all understand.IMPROVE LEGAL WRITINGStrengthen and clarify terms using AI-guided best practicesWe start with advanced scoring on multiple scales including language complexity, legal phrasing, and enforceability. Based on these scores, our intelligent assistant suggests changes that improve readability, internal consistency, and compliance to standards and best practices.COLLABORATIONCollaborate with other parties and legal professionalsSome situations require an attorney's specific knowledge and skill - in these cases, we help people collaborate with their legal team, or provide access to a network of legal professionals. Collaborative redlining tools and a clause & terms library expedite the negotiation and drafting processes - all along guided by Artificial Intelligence.RISK MANAGEMENTUnderstand, quantify, and reduce your legal riskLegal Robot integrates with Enterprise Contract Management systems to help legal departments and auditors analyze an entire portfolio of agreements in minutes. Mitigate future legal expense by flagging agreements with risky language for renegotiation. Continuously monitor new agreements for unsafe language and non-standard terms.HOW DOES IT WORK?Legal Robot uses machine learning techniques like deep learning to understand legal language, then compare the language with other contracts to identify boilerplate vs. custom, measure the complexity and readability of the language, and identify the responsibilities, rights, and terms of an agreement.The information is presented in a way that encourages exploration of the contract in a way that is far more interesting and understandable than legal language. This allows people to quickly interpret the components of the contract, quantify specific risks, as well as identify and resolve defects so people can be more confident in what they sign.CONTACT US[email protected]  Legal Robot, Inc.548 Market Street, #28970San Francisco, CA 94104P: (415) 894-0240© 2017 Legal Robot, Inc. | Events | Legal | Press | Security | Swag!

Description
NEW REVIEW: By Jason Moyse and Lisa Culbert - "For insights, knowledge, and literacy, Goodman’s book lays a clear framework for the novice to understand AI"
"For those lawyers who fall into that group of wanting to better understand AI, there may be no better starting point than Robots in Law" -Robert Ambrogi, Above The Law
Although 2016 was the breakthrough year for artificial intelligence (AI) in legal services in terms of market awareness and significant take-up, legal AI represents evolution rather than revolution. Since the first ‘robot lawyers’ started receiving mainstream press coverage, many law firms, other legal service providers, and law colleges are being asked what they are doing about AI. 
Robots in Law: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Legal Services is designed to provide a starting point in the form of an independent primer for anyone looking to get up to speed on AI in legal services. 
The book is organized into four distinct sections:
Part I: Legal AI – Beyond the hype 
Part II: Putting AI to work
Part III: AI giving back – Return on investment
Part IV: Looking ahead 
The first three present an in-depth overview, and analysis, of the current legal AI landscape; the final section includes contributions from AI experts with connections to the legal space, on the prospects for legal AI in the short-term future.
"AI is here now. And going to work in law firms.  In the second half of 2016, hardly a week went by without some firm, academic or start-up announcing an innovation. Anyone inclined to dismiss this entirely as hype should read Robots in Law. In 150-odd pages we get a clear round-up of what is happening plus (perhaps more interestingly) some predictions from the best human brains in the business about what it all means." - Michael Cross, editor, The Law Sociaty Gazzee
Along with the emergence of New Law and the burgeoning lawtech start-up economy, AI is part of a new dynamic in legal technology and it is here to stay. 
The question now is whether AI will find its place as a facilitator of legal services delivery, or whether it will initiate a shift in the value chain that will transform the legal business model. 
"This book, is recommended for all those wanting to catch up with AI, or those needing to catch up (whether they want to or not). That is pretty much all of us." - Laurence Eastham, Editor of Computers & Law, The Society for Computers and Law Magazine

Robotics “THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS” – Web Movie –





Robotics

				Hitachi’s robotics contributes to society in various areas
            





					Hitachi develops a wide variety of robots integrated with an IoT platform to improve people’s lives.
				





                        IoT has accelerated co-creation between companies and has helped create new value. But in order to leverage the full potential of IoT, data processing must go beyond cyberspace. New and innovative services in the real world will depend on our ability to combine data with physical operations. That’s why robotics will play such a crucial role moving forward, as they become our bridge between the real and virtual worlds.
					

						At Hitachi, we’ve developed a wide range of robots for various applications by leveraging our expertise in operational technologies (OT). But we’re not developing technologies without reason. We’re implementing social innovation. By integrating robots with IoT platforms, and using that technology in social infrastructures, we’re actively promoting initiatives to improve people’s lives.
					










Humanoid Robot "EMIEW3" and Robotics IT Platform for Customer Services （Short Version） - Hitachi






EMIEW3 is a human symbiotic robot that aggregates data obtained from various external sensors.
Information necessary for providing services is then processed over a cloud-based robotics IT platform and fed back to the robot – helping it navigate, communicate, and interact with its surroundings.This IT infrastructure can also be integrated with existing operational systems to provide business intelligence by processing various kinds of relevant information. We also offer business solutions with interconnected robots.






					At Hitachi, we’ve been developing robotics technology for over half a century, while focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value.
                





						The history of Hitachi Group’s robotics dates back to the 1960s with our Servo-Manipulator, a remote controlled device for nuclear power plant operations.Since then, Hitachi has introduced a wide variety of robots – from mechatronic products, such as semiconductor testing equipment and financial devices, to robots for extreme environments like nuclear power plants.

						With Hitachi’s R&D focusing on the development of automatic control and intelligent processing, our advanced robotics has served as the vehicle bringing these technologies to life.In 2005, Hitachi became one of the first companies to develop a human symbiotic robot. Rolling out improved functions in phases with new elemental technologies, by 2016 Hitachi proudly introduced EMIEW3, a service-assistance robot that can talk and work with people.
                    





                    We’re also focusing on co-creation with clients to generate new value. Currently, we’re actively setting up new facilities for conducting demonstration experiments, with multiple collaborative spaces already in operation to implement high-quality prototyping alongside our clients.
				




                    The proliferation of IoT in recent years has seen a wide array of information and knowledge stored in cyberspace. This shift has also made real-world applications of digital solutions increasingly realistic through robotics.
                    As we develop robotics solutions for the age of IoT, we’ll continue to drive social innovation forward, solving today’s challenges for a better future.
				




Hitachi has developed a wide variety of robotsthat offer new value to customers.





EMIEW3 is a Human Symbiotic Robot that Actively Communicates with People
EMIEW3 draws from Hitachi’s extensive expertise in robotics and digital solutions to realize a high level of autonomy. A cloud-based IT infrastructure serves as a “remote brain”, which monitors and controls the robot’s body. This brain connected with the robot’s body in real time also gives EMIEW3 the ability to communicate, navigate through its surroundings, and provide customer support and guidance.By accurately understanding situations in various service settings, EMIEW3 is able to recognize and approach those in need. It can even start up a conversation on its own to provide services — improving user satisfaction and  business efficiency.
								

								*For the practical application,EMIEW3 is conducting a demonstration test.

ROPITS is a Single-Passenger Mobility Support Robot that Autonomously Travels on Sidewalks
ROPITS is a single-passenger mobility support robot that features autonomous transportation. ROPITS can be summoned easily from anywhere in the city using a map on a mobile information device. Once summoned, ROPITS autonomously travels to the designated point to pick up and transport passengers to their destination. It automatically avoids obstacles through a 3D environmental recognition technology integrating multiple sensors. It also has active suspensions mounted onboard, which give it stability even on winding or uneven paths. We expect ROPITS to help the elderly and those with difficulty walking to support short-distance trips.

								*For the practical application,ROPITS is conducting a demonstration test.

The Autonomous Mobile Dual Arm Robot that’s Pioneering the Future of Logistics
Consumer needs are becoming increasingly diversified, and logistics is becoming even more complex as a result. While these trends are giving rise to a demand for more streamlined warehouse operations, current automation equipment can only be used for certain types of products and work, which limits their application.At Hitachi, we’ve developed an autonomous mobile dual arm robot that opens new opportunities for warehouses. Equipped with two commercially sold industrial arms, this robot comes with an elevating platform mounted on a travelling truck to enable height adjustments. It also includes a gripper that automates manual operations, such as pulling out shelves and picking out products.The dual arm robot uses built-in sensors to understand its own position and the location of products that need to be picked. While in motion, it can also identify specific products before picking them out from the shelves.But there’s more to this robot than order picking. With its dual arms, this advanced technology can also complete complex tasks that require coordination between two arms.With the advancement of our automation technologies, the future of logistics is closer than ever.  
*The autonomous mobile dual arm robot is still in its development stages and it is yet to be determined when it will be put to practical use.
