This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Talend SA (TLND  -  Free Report)	 announced recently that its data platform, Data Fabric has been selected by Lenovo to carry out streamlining of inventory and product data from suppliers, repositories, vendors, warehouse, and manufacturing and for other e-commerce functions.Does it Fit Lenovo’s Requirements?Currently, Lenovo has a huge inventory comprising more than five million items or unique product IDs amassed over a period of many years. However, until now, information on these products remained scattered in separate databases, inventory management systems and a host of other enterprise resources, which made the identification of available products a cumbersome process to carry out.  With the help of Talend’s Data Fabric, Lenovo will now be able to unify this scattered data as well as validate its quality. This will also enable Lenovo to catalog the information accurately, which will pave the way for more actionable information at hand.In a nutshell, Data Fabric will allow Lenovo to streamline inventory and product data from various sources, thereby enabling employees, partners as well as customers to identify product availability. Additionally, it will also enable Lenovo to advise customers in real-time on product delivery, replacement and repair schedules.What Does this Mean for Talend?Talend is a provider of cloud and big data integration solutions. During its second quarter 2016 earnings release, the company reported revenues of $25.4 million, achieving 38% year-over-year growth that was primarily driven by strong demand from the cloud and big data space.As per the 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Integration Tools, Talend made its way into the ‘Leaders’ quadrant that features other big players such as Informatica, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report)	, Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report)	 and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report)	 among others.Moreover, as per a research report by IDC, the big data and analytics market is estimated to be worth $203 billion by 2020. Given the huge prospect for growth in the big data space, we expect Talend to do well in the long run.Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our sale of 5,250,000 ADSs in this
offering will be $83.9 million, or $91.6 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, based on the initial public
offering price of $18.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs, we will not
receive any proceeds from any sale of ADSs by the selling shareholder.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, to create a public market for our stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and shareholders,
to obtain additional capital and to increase our visibility in the marketplace.
We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and
marketing activities, research and development activities, general and
administrative matters and capital expenditures, and to pay the entire
outstanding balance, accrued interest and prepayment fees under our credit
facility with Square 1. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to make complementary acquisitions or investments. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or investments at
this time.

Our credit facility with Square 1 matures on May 29, 2017. We are required to
pay a prepayment fee of $267 thousand if certain events occur prior to the
maturity date, including if we or our co-borrowers complete an initial public
offering. Loans under the credit facility bear interest at Square 1's "prime
rate" plus 2.50%, but not less than 5.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears.
As of March 31, 2016, we had drawn down $11.0 million under the credit facility,
and subsequent to March 31, 2016, we drew down an additional $1.0 million.
Borrowings under this credit facility have been used for general corporate
purposes. 

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this
offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we
plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term
and long-term interest-bearing obligations, including government and
investment-grade debt securities and money market funds.


The market for our products is highly competitive, quickly evolving, and
subject to rapid changes in technology, which may expand the alternatives
available to our customers for their data integration requirements. Our current
primary competitors generally fall into four categories:

• Diversified technology companies that offer data integration solutions,
  including: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP;

• Pure-play data integration vendors, including: Ab Initio, Informatica, and
  Tibco;

• Early-stage, niche data integration technologies; and

• Hand-coded, custom data integration solutions built internally by
  organizations that we target as potential customers.

We believe that we are well-positioned in the marketplace relative to our
competitors. We are differentiated from traditional vendors by our advanced
technology and rapid innovation, both of which are driven by our open source
platform, and emerging niche vendors cannot match the scale of our product
breadth or go-to-market capabilities.

Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors
could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:

• Greater name recognition and longer operating histories;

• Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;

• Broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners
  and customers;

• Greater customer support resources;

• Greater resources to make acquisitions;

• Lower labor and development costs;

• Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and

• Substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources.

We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies
enter the data integration software market, as customer requirements evolve, and
as new products and technologies are introduced. We believe that the principal
factors that drive our competitive edge in our market include:

• Product features, architecture reliability, performance, and effectiveness;

• Name and reputation of the vendor or competitive offering;

• Vision for the market and product roadmap, as well as pace of innovation;

• Interoperability with numerous big data solutions vendors;

• Integration with leading cloud and on-premise systems;

• Automation capabilities;

• Ability to adapt development, sales and marketing to the open source software
  model;

• Strength of sales and marketing efforts;

• Strategic partnerships with major enterprise software and infrastructure
  providers;

• Quality of support;

• Demonstrated return on investment through time-to-value and total cost of
  ownership; and

• Ease-of-use and efficiency during deployment.


Company Description
Our mission is to enable every organization to harness the power of their
data. Our software platform, Talend Data Fabric, integrates data and
applications in real time across modern big data and cloud environments, as well
as traditional systems, allowing organizations to develop a unified view


 of
their business and customers across organizational and technology silos.
Effective and strategic use of data to optimize every aspect of business is a
competitive advantage. Talend is a key enabler of the data-driven enterprise
where data is becoming a strategic asset. Talend Data Fabric allows customers in
any industry to improve business performance by using their data to create new
insights and to automate business processes. Our customers rely on our software
to better understand their customers, improve customer service, detect fraud,
and predict equipment maintenance needs.

The amount of data available for decision making is increasing exponentially,
and the technology to analyze and act on that data is becoming dramatically more
capable and cost-effective, and ubiquitous. As a result, IT infrastructure is
undergoing an industrywide, transformative shift toward new big data and cloud
platforms. At the same time, the increasing pace of business is driving the need
for more real-time data processing and the need to make data-driven decisions
throughout every organization is creating demand for self-service business and
analytical applications. The growth in data sources such as mobile and social,
and the rise of new big data and cloud platforms to analyze this data, combine
to create major growth engines for the data integration market. We believe our
products immediately address the markets for Data Integration and Integrity
Software, Master Data Management, and Integration and Orchestration Middleware,
which International Data Corporation, or IDC, estimates combined were $16
billion in 2015 and are forecasted to reach $21 billion in 2019. Within those
large markets, demand for big data integration and cloud integration is growing
particularly quickly due to growth in their underlying markets. The markets for
big data technology and services and public IT cloud services are expected to
grow at compound annual growth rates, or CAGRs, of 23% and 19%, respectively,
from 2015 to 2019 according to IDC estimates.

Talend Data Fabric provides a comprehensive, flexible platform to address IT
integration needs across industries. Our platform works seamlessly at the speed
and scale of modern big data architectures and across on-premise and cloud
environments to connect both traditional and big data environments.
Organizations can quickly integrate all forms of data across systems and
applications at scale, with significantly improved performance and lower total
cost of ownership than traditional data integration approaches. Our platform
interoperates with modern big data technologies, such as Hadoop, Spark, and
Spark Streaming, and our flexible product architecture enables us to rapidly
adopt new technologies as they emerge. Our technology allows our customers to
manage both batch and real-time data processing and incorporate machine learning
to leverage data for the automation of operational workflows. Our flexible cloud
architecture allows organizations to operate in a cloud-based environment such
as Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, or Microsoft Azure, in their
on-premise datacenter, in private clouds, or in any hybrid combination. Our
Talend Big Data Integration solution can run up to seven times faster on big
data platforms than a certain large competitor's product, according to a
McKnight Consulting Group, or MCG, study we commissioned.

We offer Talend Data Fabric as a subscription license based primarily on the
number of users of our platform. Individual developers often discover Talend
through our open source offerings and introduce our solutions more broadly
within their organizations. Many of these organizations choose to license our
commercial products for enterprise deployment. After an initial deployment,
organizations often purchase additional subscriptions or expand their usage to
additional modules within Talend Data Fabric. The unified code base and
modularity of our products allows organizations to enable additional
functionality with just a license key, significantly reducing software
deployment and training costs.

We have a broad, global customer base that includes Allianz, Citi, General
Electric, Lenovo and Siemens and spans a broad range of industries, including
financial services, technology, telecommunications, healthcare, manufacturing,
and retail. We have developed an ecosystem of over 120 partners including
Cloudera, Hortonworks, MapR, and Amazon Web Services, as well as many leading
systems integrators such as Accenture and Capgemini. This ecosystem extends the
capabilities of our platform, enhances our sales reach and market penetration,
and maximizes the value of our solutions for our customers.

Why Talend?
Embrace Today’s Technologies and and Tomorrow’s Innovations 


 
1













The Data Imperative
We are in an increasingly data-driven world where winners and losers are being decided based on how well they can leverage data. In every industry, intensely data-driven companies are emerging and changing the basis of competition.
The stakes are high. Either you become great at using data, or you become obsolete.







Becoming a Data-Driven Leader
With Talend, you’ll gain the data agility you need to:


Harness the power of the cloud
Drive real-time insights and predictive analytics
Future-proof your data architecture
And, make better data-driven decisions every day





The Talend Difference


Unified
On-premise, in the cloud or hybrid environment, easily manage data of any type, volume or speed, with a unified platform for integration, big data, self-service, machine learning, governance, and more.  

Native
Integrate once, deploy anywhere. Native code generation for faster performance and less overhead. Future-proof your development effort; leverage the full capabilities of every platform and switch to the latest technology with a single click.  

Open-Source
Benefit from the experience of thousands of developers and our close ties to the entire Apache ecosystem. Talend’s open source rooted tools enable you to keep pace with the latest market developments and innovations.




Talend’s unified platform architecture meets all of our needs with regards to data integration and data governance. We looked at functionality, ease of use, and scalability. Talend has everything we need today to meet our marketing requirements and what we will need in the future.

														You don’t have to learn it to build it.

														Reduce total cost of ownership.													
A simple, predictable pricing model based on developers not data sources or volumes dramatically lowers TCO. Our modern architecture reduces installation and maintenance costs and a single design environment lowers training time and cost.

              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.
