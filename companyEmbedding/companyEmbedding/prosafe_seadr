Operations[edit]
Prosafe’s operations are related to maintenance and modification of installations on fields already in production, hook-up and commissioning of new fields, tie-backs to existing infrastructure and decommissioning.
Prosafe is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with ticker code PRS.
Accommodation/service rigs[edit]
Accommodation vessels offer additional accommodation, engineering, construction or storage capacity offshore. Prosafe’s vessels have accommodation capacity for 306-812 people. They have catering facilities, storage, workshops, offices, medical services, deck cranes and lifesaving and fire fighting equipment aboard. The vessels are positioned alongside the host installation and are connected by means of a telescopic gangway so that personnel can walk to work.
History[edit]
Prosafe was formed in 1997, when the platform drilling and technical services divisions de-merged from Transocean as a separate company and became listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange as Procon Offshore ASA. This company merged with Safe Offshore ASA, thereby entering the business segment of accommodation/service rigs, and changed its name to Prosafe ASA.
Prosafe acquired floating production company Nortrans Offshore in 2001, extending its activities to include the conversion, chartering and operation of FPSOs and FSOs.
In 2005, Prosafe sold the Drilling Services division. In 2006, the company acquired Consafe Offshore AB, which owned three semi-submersible accommodation/service rigs and one accommodation jack-up. This acquisition cemented Prosafe’s leading position in the market for semi-submersible accommodation/service rigs.
In May 2008, Prosafe spun off business division Floating Production. This business division became an independent company, named Prosafe Production Public Limited. On November 25, 2010, BW Offshore completed the 100% [2] acquisition of Prosafe Production Public Ltd., for approximately NOK3,120.92m ($489.88m).

2 History
3 References



Operations[edit]
Prosafe’s operations are related to maintenance and modification of installations on fields already in production, hook-up and commissioning of new fields, tie-backs to existing infrastructure and decommissioning.
Prosafe is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange with ticker code PRS.
Accommodation/service rigs[edit]
Accommodation vessels offer additional accommodation, engineering, construction or storage capacity offshore. Prosafe’s vessels have accommodation capacity for 306-812 people. They have catering facilities, storage, workshops, offices, medical services, deck cranes and lifesaving and fire fighting equipment aboard. The vessels are positioned alongside the host installation and are connected by means of a telescopic gangway so that personnel can walk to work.
History[edit]
Prosafe was formed in 1997, when the platform drilling and technical services divisions de-merged from Transocean as a separate company and became listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange as Procon Offshore ASA. This company merged with Safe Offshore ASA, thereby entering the business segment of accommodation/service rigs, and changed its name to Prosafe ASA.
Prosafe acquired floating production company Nortrans Offshore in 2001, extending its activities to include the conversion, chartering and operation of FPSOs and FSOs.
In 2005, Prosafe sold the Drilling Services division. In 2006, the company acquired Consafe Offshore AB, which owned three semi-submersible accommodation/service rigs and one accommodation jack-up. This acquisition cemented Prosafe’s leading position in the market for semi-submersible accommodation/service rigs.
In May 2008, Prosafe spun off business division Floating Production. This business division became an independent company, named Prosafe Production Public Limited. On November 25, 2010, BW Offshore completed the 100% [2] acquisition of Prosafe Production Public Ltd., for approximately NOK3,120.92m ($489.88m).

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.              
              
            

5:22 p.m. July 27, 2017






Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  1.53 (07/19/17)      EPS (TTM)  $2.24      Market Cap $277.14 M     Shares Outstanding 71.41 M     Public Float N/A     Yield PRSEY has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
