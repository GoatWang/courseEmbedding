We empathize with our clients and understand the difficult decisions that have already been made, and will need to be made in the future.Given the impact divorce can have on a family’s financial position, it’s critically important that clients understand the long-term implications of settlement alternatives.

Investment Management — Daniels + Tansey























































Personalized service,integrated solutions



Today’s world is increasingly connected. Financial matters are no different.At Daniels + Tansey, we integrate financial advisory, tax, and investment management services.It's our ensemble approach, and it's a one-stop solution for your wealth management needs.







Core OfferingsPortfolio ManagementRisk Management (i.e., insurance)Fixed IncomeInvestment ConsultingWith 60+ years of combined investment experience, we deliver institutional-quality service.As an independent advisor (no bank or broker-dealer affiliation), our decisions are made only with our clients' best interests in mind.We follow a proven, intentional portfolio construction process: holdings are modeled based off of asset allocation or fixed income strategies, each of which can be customized to meet a client’s liquidity needs, income / return requirements, time horizon, gain / loss restrictions and tax considerations. All of these are designed to provide a diversified portfolio solution within a defined risk objective.How does portfolio management tie into financial planning?Investment planning is part of a comprehensive financial plan. Done right, it's the start of an investor profile, and includes size, objectives, risk tolerance, constraints. Once a portfolio is active, its gains / losses can affect cash flow, and taxes need to be accounted for.Financial planning, investment planning, and tax planning are a continuous loop. The benefit of financial planning, tax, and investment professionals working together never ends.Investment ConsultingSome of our clients join us with existing advisor relationships, or manage an account on their own.While we feel that our value to clients is maximized by employing the ensemble team in its entirety – advisory, tax, and investment management – we certainly understand that client needs vary.If and when this is the case, Daniels + Tansey can provide any combination of independent services: performance review, strategic consultation, and custom reporting. We have found these engagements to be of direct benefit to clients’ investments, and are also an opportunity to link investment decisions to their financial plan.To learn more about our investment services, whether stand-alone or as part of the integrated ensemble, please call or contact us using the button below.* While investment planning is provided by Daniels + Tansey as part of most financial planning engagements, portfolio management (and security selection) is administered through DT Investment Partners, an affiliated sub-advisor.

They seek low volatility and consistent returns through emphasis on diversification and determining the optimal mix of asset classes for each clients risk profile and return objectives. DT Investment Partners' investment process utilizes fundamental, valuation and technical analysis to tactically shift between asset classes and capitalize on the benefits from both fundamental valuation changes and price momentum.DT Investment Partners investment process utilizes a combination of both top-down and bottom-up analysis. Their top-down analysis focuses on: (1) evaluation of the global economic outlook on a 3-month, 6-month and 12-month basis to determine relative strength or weakness (2) evaluation of fiscal and monetary policy impact for all major markets (3) the determination of inflationary expectations and its impact on purchasing power and (4) assessment of valuation metrics in the context of historical averages and current growth expectations. The firm uses technical analysis to identify price trends in major asset classes.

They develop strategic asset allocations based on historical risk and return metrics. Strategic allocation ranges are designed to control risk for each type of investor. The primary driver of their tactical asset allocation shifts are the economic fundamentals of the various target markets. Tactical decisions are augmented by the use of a proprietary technical analysis model to ensure the portfolio is protected from irrational price momentum.The firm's portfolio construction process involves 5 steps. First, they create a detailed client profile based on portfolio size, investment objectives, risk tolerance and investment constraints. They then identify the investment opportunity set using bonds, stocks and alternative investments. The next step focuses on identifying where each client fits on the efficient frontier which measures the balance between risk and return. DT Investment Partners next creates a strategic asset allocation based on historical risk-adjusted returns.Finally, portfolios are tactically rebalanced based on a combination of the clients changing needs and the firm's fundamental and technical analysis.The firm's fixed-income investment strategy seeks low volatility and consistent returns through emphasis on diversification and the minimization of interest rate risk by constraining duration bands.
