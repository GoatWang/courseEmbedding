Open Mouth Bag Filling
A variety of solid bulk materials are packaged in open mouth bags for use by consumers and businesses. Many industries use open mouth bags to distribute their products and provide a crisp, clean, aesthetically appealing product at the point of sale..  The wide top end of the open mouth bag allows for a variety of different products with widely varying mesh sizes, bulk densities and flow characteristics to be packaged.  The open mouth bagging scales that fill these containers can be either Gross Weigh or Net Weigh scales.
Open mouth bags are typically constructed of kraft (paper), poly woven mesh, plastic film or burlap. All of these bags need to be closed after filling by using a sewing head, heat sealer or pinch bag closer.
The process of open mouth bag filling begins with the placement of an empty bag on or below the fill spout of the bag scale. For gross weighing, the fill spout of the packer is suspended from an electronic load cell that accurately weighs the amount of product in the bag. In net weigh applications, the material is pre-weighed in scales above the open mouth bag filler, then discharged into the open mouth bag. The bag can be placed on the fill spout by hand or by an automated open mouth bag placer.  Once the bag is filled, it is released and drops to the sewing conveyor belt.
Transfer Methods
Open mouth bag fillers can use a variety of methods to transfer the product from the bulk bin to the bag. Some of the most common techniques are as follows:
Gravity scales use the bulk density and flow characteristics of the product to fill the open mouth bag by use of cutoff gates. These gates close when the bag has reached the desired weight. Free flowing granular products such as grains, fertilizer, salt and small pellets are packaged on these scales.
Vibratory feeder scales utilize side to side movement of the vibratory tray to transfer the product into the bag. These scales use varying vibratory speeds to move difficult materials or to provide precise accurate measurements of granular material. Materials that do not flow easily or have irregular shapes such as ground coffee, light density grass seed or granola usually incorporate vibration in open mouth bag fillers.
Belt Feeder scales are used for packaging material that tends to stick to itself during the fill process. The belt feeder uses adjustable product height and speed settings to deliver the product into the open mouth bag accurately. Sweet molasses based cattle feed, mulch and topsoil are bagged on belt feeder units.
Auger packers feature a screw or auger that moves the product into the bag. Powders to granular material can be packaged with an auger packer. Open mouth bag filling using auger packers are used for difficult to feed materials such as starches and flours or easily fluidized powders.



Open-Mouth Bag Placer
Model TOMP
The Taylor Products' Model TOMP Automatic Open Mouth Bag Placer will place kraft bags on the spout of an electronic bagging scale at a rate of up to 12 bags per minute.



Economical Beam Scale
OM Series
The OM2 Series of open mouth baggers use Taylor's patented self dampening beam scale for reliability and accuracy. The flow control regulates the speed of material going through the scale and can be adjusted for light or heavy density material.



Electronic Bagging Scale
Model TE100
Taylor Products' TE100 open mouth bagging scale is loaded with standard features that are optional on many other brands of scales.



Small, Vibratory Net-Weigh Scale
TE10 Series
The TE10 Series are electronic, small net weigh scales designed for weighments of 2 oz. to 12 lb. The TE10 Series is designed with a solid mount net weigh bucket to increase accuracy.



Vibratory, Gross-Weigh Scale for Sticky or Irregular Materials
VG Series
The VG Series bagging scale weighs products with bulky or erratic flow characteristics with extreme accuracy. The vibratory feeder moves the difficult material from the hopper to the bag.



Gravity Net-Weigh Scale for Free-Flowing Pellets / Granules
GN Series
The GN net weigh scale is designed for packaging free-flowing, granular products into open mouth bags. The net weigh bucket continuously refills with product and is discharged by the operator's signal.



Large Vibratory Net-Weigh Scale
VN Series
The VN Series has been designed for packaging difficult to feed or fragile materials into open mouth bags. A vibratory feeding pan with a two-speed fill rate moves a large volume of material quickly and gently.



Single Auger Packer for Powders
Model APO
The Taylor Model APO is designed to fill open mouth bags with powder products that are aerated, bind, cake, or bridge easily.



Dual Auger Packer for Powders
Model APO Dual
The Taylor Model APO Dual is designed with variable speed augers perfecting the art of 'bulk and dribble' feeding.



Impeller Packer for Dense and Abrasive Powders
Model IPO
The Taylor Model IPO was designed for efficient packaging of heavy, dense, difficult-to-feed powders, and fine granular mixture into open mouth bags.



Box / Drum / Pail Vibratory Filler
VB Series
The Taylor VB Series is engineered to accurately fill boxes, small drums, pails and buckets. Features include 15 cubic foot product hopper, adjustable two speed vibratory feeder and roller scale base with electronic load cell.



Incline Auger Packer for Moderately Flowing Materials

The Incline Auger Packer electronic bagging scale weighs material with extreme accuracy. The incline screw moves the material from the hopper to the bag. Filling bags from 40 to 120 pounds.



High-Speed Net-Weigh Scale
Model RT7000
The RT7000 is Taylor Products' premium, net-weigh packaging machine with precise weighments, and high production capacity. A gravity-fed, primary fill cycle is complimented by a vibratory-fed, secondary cycle to provide the fastest possible rates and the most precise accuracy when packaging free-flowing products like grains, pet foods or granular products.



High-Speed Open-Mouth Bag Placer
Model THP5500
The THP5500 Automatic Bagging System offers the best value in integrated bagging machinery today. This system is ideal for handling free-flowing materials such as pet food, sugar, seed, fertilizer, rice, cat litter and plastic pellets.



Weigh Controller T4000
T4000
Taylor Products’ basic weigh controller provides excellent packaging accuracy and is operator friendly. Program changes for different bag weights or machine functions are intuitive and simple from the basic keypad.



Weigh Controller T3000
T3000
The T3000’s cutting edge technology will provide ease of use when configuring, networking, calibrating, and storing information.

Welcome
Taylor Products, a division of Magnum Systems, your leading provider for custom packaging and container handling equipment.







Air Packers - "Batteries Not Included"
As a parent of 9 kids (go ahead, read it again) I have more than once forgotten, no matter how hard I try to remember, to double check all the boxes at Christmas and make sure that I picked up enough of the necessary supplies to make everything work when the packages are opened on Christmas Day.









Robotic Valve Bag Placing - "Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto"
Let’s face it, robots are scary. At some point or another, no matter how hard we try, in our mind they become RoboCop or Yul Brenner’s gunslinger from WestWorld. We get it. They were scary for us at first, too.









Why Does Taylor Products Introduce New Technologies? Because Rent Is Due!
The bulk solids and powder industry is constantly changing and two basic motivations are the driving force: the need to improve efficiencies; and the desire to automate the manufacturing process.









Magnum Systems: Designed-To-Customize
I read an interesting article the other day, “Made To Order: Serving Up Machines That Aren’t On The Menu” in the Fall 2015 issue of Packaging & Process OEM.









Service, Sincerity & Integrity...This is Magnum Systems
Taylor Products and Smoot Company, Divisions of Magnum Systems, place a special value on their approach to service. Whether it’s a bag filling machine, a rotary airlock, a pneumatic conveying system or full processing solution, our approach is the same…provide the best experience from Concept to Completion.

Bulk Bag IBC Systems
Bulk Bags or Jumbo Bags, also referred to as Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container (FIBC) are used for transporting or temporary storage of dry bulk solid materials. The typical bulk bag is constructed of poly woven material and has a capacity of 500 to 3,000 lbs.  The bulk bags have a variety of bag loop styles, inlet spouts, discharge outlets and sizes specific to individual product characteristics.  Bulk material handling equipment includes both bulk bag filling and bulk bag unloading.
Bulk Bag Unloader
The bulk bag unloader is designed to unload product from a filled bulk bag for packaging or further processing. Bulk bag unloaders can consist of simple stands that support the filled bag over a discharge outlet to units that can meter out a specific amount of product and shut off the flow automatically.  The bulk bag discharger can be equipped with options that help promote consistent flow of product such as side bag manipulators, vibrators and bottom bag agitators. Units can be loaded with either a forklift or an integrated hoist and trolley. The addition of an iris valve or circumferential cutoff will allow for a bag to be removed from the bulk bag unloader without being fully emptied.
Bulk Bag Filler
The bulk bag filler typically consists of a bag frame to hold the bag, product flow control valve or gate and an integral weigh scale system with controls. Bulk bag filling systems can range from simple basic frames to a more sophisticated system with pallet dispensers and accumulation conveyors for filled bags. The bulk bag filling process involves an operator hanging the bag from the filler frame and attaching the fill spout or neck of the bulk bag to the filler. The standard bulk bag filler incorporates an inflatable neck seal with a dust collection port to reduce airborne dust during the fill cycle. Once the bag is filled to the required weight, the flow of product into the bag is shut off and the filled bag is ready to be removed from the filler.



Bulk Bag Unloading IBC2000
Bulk Bag Unloader
Taylor's IBC2000 is adaptable to nearly any discharge or de-weigh application using bulk bags. The IBC2000 can be easily modified with a number of options in order to handle your specific requirements.



Bulk Bag Filling IBC3000
Bulk Bag / Box / Drum Packer
Taylor's IBC3000 Packers are engineered for a variety of materials and containers. The IBC's modular design allows complete flexibility from a free standing manual operation to a fully integrated and automated system handling bags, drums, and boxes.



Weigh Controller
T3000
The T3000’s cutting edge technology will provide ease of use when configuring, networking, calibrating, and storing information.



Weigh Controller
T4000
Taylor Products’ basic weigh controller provides excellent packaging accuracy and is operator friendly. Program changes for different bag weights or machine functions are intuitive and simple from the basic keypad.

Steps to Apply for Federal Financial Student Aid (FAFSA)     
Orem Campus School Code: E02200
West Jordan Campus School Code: 041732
STEP 1: Getting an FSA ID

To apply for your ID go to fsaid.ed.gov
Create a FSA ID
Your ID is your electronic signature for FAFSA on the web.  If you are a dependent student your parents will need an FSA ID, too.
The Department of Education considers a student independent by the following criteria: If none of the above

You are at least 24 years old on the day you file your FAFSA
You are married on the day you file your FAFSA
You are a parent

For additional questions regarding your FSA ID please visit https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out#get-fsaid or contact the Financial Aid Department.
STEP 2: IRS Data Retrieval Tool
If you are eligible, we highly recommend you use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.  This tool allows both the student and their parents to access and transfer their tax return information directly onto the FAFSA website. It ensures that all information is correct and allows you to proceed without providing copies of your tax return. If you are eligible to use the IRS Data Retrieval tool click Link to IRS and provide the exact address and information used to file your taxes.
If you are ineligible you will need to gather your most recent tax information and manually enter the data. To find out if you are eligible or for additional information about the IRS Data Retrieval Tool please see: http://www.finaid.org/fafsa/irsdataretrievaltool.phtml
STEP 3: Side note for filling out the FAFSA

 If you have already filed a FAFSA for the current award year there is no need to do it again. Just add Taylor Andrews Academy to your list of schools under school selection with our school code

E02200 – Orem
 041732 – West Jordan

When you enter your High School please click the “confirm” button so that the system can accurately record

*Please note that the FAFSA is a FREE Application for Federal Student Aid and will never ask for payment information.
STEP 4: Complete your Entrance Counseling and Master Promissory Note at:

All students who plan to take out Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loans will be required to complete Entrance Counseling and Sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN).
You can access both tasks at www.studentloans.gov. Please be sure to enter the school you plan to attend when completing your Entrance Counseling and MPN.
