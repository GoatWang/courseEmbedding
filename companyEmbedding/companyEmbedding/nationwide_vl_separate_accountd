	Legal Proceedings


	Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company


	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with
	its subsidiaries, "the Company") was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and
	retirement savings operations of the Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base. NFS is incorporated in Delaware
	and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.


	The Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in
	the ordinary course of its business. The Company's legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the Company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the Company operates. These
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcomes cannot be predicted. Regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the Company's litigation matters. Furthermore, it is often
	not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred to
	below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs' claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not
	yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and
	equitable remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company believes, however, that based on currently known information, the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and
	regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability
	of litigation, it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the Company's condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period.


	The various businesses conducted by the Company are subject to
	oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and state insurance
	authorities. Such regulatory entities may, in the normal course, be engaged in general or targeted inquiries, examinations and investigations of the Company and/or its




	PROS-0272













	affiliates. The financial services industry has been the subject of
	increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues; with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the Company and/or its affiliates, the Company is cooperating with regulators. The Company will cooperate with Nationwide
	Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) insofar as any inquiry, examination or investigation encompasses NMIC's operations.


	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed
	in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
	and Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. On November 18, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a sixth amended complaint amending the list of named plaintiffs and claiming to represent a class of qualified retirement plan trustees under the Employee
	Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
	allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and
	attorneys' fees. On November 6, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On October 21, 2010, the District Court dismissed NFS from the lawsuit. On February 6, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
	November 6, 2009 order granting class certification and remanded the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On September 6, 2013, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. NLIC filed a motion for
	summary judgment on March 17, 2014. Oral argument on the motion for summary judgment is scheduled for July 11, 2014. The case is set for trial beginning February 9, 2015. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.


	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.
	(NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance
	Company, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On March 12, 2010, NRS and NLIC were named in a Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed in the Circuit
	Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Steven E. Coker, Sandra H. Turner, David N. Lichtenstein and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide Retirement
	Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, Inc., PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	claiming to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association, Inc. (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the
	Deferred Compensation Committee, ASEA's directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO's directors, officers and board members. On October 22, 2010, the parties to this action executed a court approved stipulation of settlement that agreed to
	certify a class for settlement purposes only, that provided for payments to the settlement class, and that provided for releases, certain bar orders, and dismissal of the case. The settlement fund has been paid out. On December 6, 2011, the Court
	entered an Order that NRS owed indemnification to ASEA and PEBCO for only the Coker (Gwin) class action, and dismissed NLIC. The Company resolved the indemnification claims of ASEA. On February 15, 2013, the Court issued its Order determining the
	amount of fees due to PEBCO on its indemnification claim. On March 28, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial Court decision awarding PEBCO its attorney fees and remanded the case back to the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of
	NRS. PEBCOs counsel has asked the court to reconsider its decision. NRS continues to defend this case vigorously.


	Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Debtors) and Giddens, James v
	NLIC and NMIC, et al.



	In 2012 the Plaintiff, Debtor in Possession Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc., filed a class action in the United States Bankruptcy
	Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the recovery of certain assets from approximately 200 defendants, including NLIC and NMIC (the "Distributed Action"). The claims against NLIC and NMIC arise from the bankruptcy filings in 2008 of
	the Plaintiff and its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc., which triggered the early termination of two collateralized debt obligation transactions, resulting in payments to NLIC and NMIC. The Plaintiff seeks to have certain sums returned
	to the bankruptcy estate in addition to prejudgment interest and costs. The case is currently stayed. In 2013, Plaintiff sent correspondence to all defendants inviting settlement discussions and has served NMIC and NLIC with a "SPV Derivatives ADR
	Notice," formally starting the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. NMIC and NLIC have responded, and are currently taking part in the ADR process. On January 10, 2014, Lehman filed a final motion to extend the stay, which continues to be in
	effect. On May 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on a scheduling order governing the Distributed Action. The parties are continuing to negotiate the proposed scheduling order prior to submission to the court. On July 17, 2014, the parties reached a
	settlement of this matter. The settlement paperwork is currently being prepared.

Prospectus supplement dated August 2, 2013
to the following prospectus(es):
Nationwide DestinationSM All American Gold New York 2.0 prospectus dated May 1, 2013 


This
 supplement updates certain information contained in your prospectus. Please read it and keep it with your prospectus for future reference.  
For contracts issued on or after _______, 2013, Contract
Owners who have elected the 7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider may elect a one-time withdrawal ("Non-Lifetime Withdrawal") without initiating the lifetime income benefit under the 7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider. As a result, the following
changes apply to the prospectus: 


(1) 
The definition of "Current
Income Benefit Base" in the "Glossary of Special Terms" is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:  
Current Income Benefit Base-
For purposes of the 7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider, it is equal to the Original Income Benefit Base adjusted throughout the life of the contract to account for subsequent purchase payments, excess withdrawals, reset opportunities, and if
elected, the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal. This amount is multiplied by the Lifetime Withdrawal Percentage to arrive at the benefit amount for any given year. 


(2) 
The following terms are added
to the "Glossary of Special Terms":  
Adjusted Roll-up Income Benefit Base- The Original Income Benefit Base after it has been reduced proportionally as a result of a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal.
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal- For
purposes of the 7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider, a one-time only election to take a withdrawal from the contract that will not initiate the benefit under the option. 


(3) 
The first paragraph of the "7%
Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider (formerly the 7% Lifetime Income Option)" section of the "Synopsis of the Contracts" is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:  
The 7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider provides for Lifetime
Withdrawals, up to a certain amount each year, even after the Contract Value is $0, provided that the Contract Owner does not deplete the Current Income Benefit Base by taking excess withdrawals and does not make certain assignments or Contract
Owner changes. Investment restrictions apply. Additionally, if the Contract Owner delays taking Lifetime Withdrawals and does not elect to take a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal for 10 years, Nationwide will guarantee that the Current Income Benefit Base on
the 10th Contract Anniversary will be no less than the Original Income Benefit Base plus simple interest at a rate of 7% annually for each of those 10 years. The 7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider is available under the contract at the time of
application. The Contract Owner (or the Annuitant in the case of a non-natural Contract Owner) must be between age 45 and 85 at the time of application. 


(4) 
The "Determination of the
Income Benefit Base Prior to the First Lifetime Withdrawal" subsection of the "7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider (formerly the 7% Lifetime Income Option)" section is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 
 Determination of the Income Benefit Base Prior to the
First Lifetime Withdrawal Upon contract issuance, the
Original Income Benefit Base is equal to the Contract Value. Thereafter, Nationwide tracks, on a continuous basis, the Current Income Benefit Base which is used to calculate the benefit amount. The Current Income Benefit Base from the date of
contract issuance until the first Lifetime Withdrawal will reflect any additional purchase payments, Purchase Payment Credits, reset opportunities, and if elected, a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, as described below.
Provided no withdrawals are taken from the contract, the
Current Income Benefit Base for the 7% Nationwide Linc Option will equal the greater of: 


(1) 
Highest Contract Value: the highest Contract Value on any Contract Anniversary plus purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after that Contract Anniversary; or 

(2) 
Roll-up Value: the 7% roll-up amount, which is equal to the sum of the following calculations:   


(a) 
Original Income Benefit Base
with Roll-up: the Original Income Benefit Base, plus 7% of the Original Income Benefit Base for each Contract Anniversary up to and including the 10th
Contract Anniversary; plus      
  


(b) 
Subsequent Purchase Payments
with Roll-up: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after contract issuance and before the 10th Contract Anniversary, increased
by simple interest at an annual rate of 7% each year from the date the subsequent purchase payments and/or Purchase Payment Credits are applied through the 10th Contract Anniversary;
plus 

(c) 
Subsequent Purchase Payments
with No Roll-up: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after the 10th Contract Anniversary.  
Contracts issued on or after _______, 2013, or the date of
state approval (whichever is later), are eligible to take a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal. If a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal is taken on or before the 10th Contract Anniversary, the Current Income
Benefit Base for the 7% Nationwide Linc Option will equal the greatest of: 


(1) 
Adjusted Current Income
Benefit Base: the Current Income Benefit Base immediately before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, proportionally reduced as described in the "Non-Lifetime Withdrawal" section; 

(2) 
Highest Contract Value: the highest Contract Value on any Contract Anniversary on or after the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, plus purchase payments submitted and any Purchase Payment Credits applied after that Contract Anniversary; or


(3) 
Roll-up Value: the adjusted 7% roll-up amount, which is equal to the sum of the following calculations:   


(a) 
Adjusted Roll-up Income
Benefit Base with Roll-up: the Adjusted Roll-up Income Benefit Base, plus 7% of the Adjusted Roll-up Income Benefit Base for each Contract Anniversary up to and including the 10th Contract Anniversary; plus 

(b) 
Subsequent Purchase Payments
with Roll-up: the sum of the following calculations:   


(i) 
Before the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after contract issuance and before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, proportionally reduced as described in the "Non-Lifetime Withdrawal"
section, increased by simple interest at an annual rate of 7% each year from the date the subsequent purchase payments and/or Purchase Payment Credits are applied through the 10th Contract
Anniversary; plus 

(ii) 
After the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal and before the 10th Contract Anniversary: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied on or after the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal and before the 10th Contract Anniversary, increased by simple interest at an annual rate of 7% each year from the date the subsequent purchase payments and/or Purchase Payment
Credits are applied through the 10th Contract Anniversary; plus   


(c) 
Subsequent Purchase Payments
with No Roll-up: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after the 10th Contract Anniversary.  
If a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal is taken after the 10th Contract Anniversary, the Current Income Benefit Base for the 7% Nationwide Linc Option will equal the greatest of: 


(1) 
Adjusted Current Income
Benefit Base: the Current Income Benefit Base immediately before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, proportionally reduced as described in the "Non-Lifetime Withdrawal" section; 

(2) 
Roll-up Value: the adjusted 7% roll-up amount, which is equal to the sum of the following calculations:   


(a) 
Adjusted Roll-up Income
Benefit Base with Roll-up: the Adjusted Roll-up Income Benefit Base, plus 7% of the Adjusted Roll-up Income Benefit Base for each Contract Anniversary up to and including the 10th Contract Anniversary; plus 

(b) 
Subsequent Purchase Payments
with Roll-up: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after contract issuance and before the 10th Contract Anniversary,
proportionally reduced as described in the "Non-Lifetime Withdrawal" section, increased by simple interest at an annual rate of 7% each year from the date the subsequent purchase payments and/or Purchase Payment Credits are applied through the 10th Contract Anniversary; plus 

(c) 
Subsequent Purchase Payments
with No Roll-up: the sum of the following calculations:   


(i) 
After the 10th Contract Anniversary and before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied after the 10th Contract Anniversary and before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal, proportionally reduced as described in the "Non-Lifetime Withdrawal" section; plus 

(ii) 
After the Non-Lifetime
Withdrawal: any purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied on or after the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal; or    
 
  


(3) 
Highest Contract Value: the highest Contract Value on any Contract Anniversary after the 10th Contract Anniversary, plus purchase payments submitted and Purchase Payment Credits applied
after that Contract Anniversary.  
When a purchase payment and any Purchase Payment Credits are
applied on a date other than a Contract Anniversary, simple interest is calculated using a prorated method based upon the number of days from the date of the purchase payment to the next Contract Anniversary. However, if at any time prior to the
first Lifetime Withdrawal the Contract Value equals $0, no additional purchase payments will be accepted and no further benefit base calculations will be made. The Current Income Benefit Base will be set equal to the benefit base calculated on the
most recent Contract Anniversary minus adjustments made for excess withdrawals after that date, and the Lifetime Withdrawal Amount will be based on that Current Income Benefit Base. Since the roll-up is only calculated for the first 10 Contract
Years or prior to the first Lifetime Withdrawal, whichever comes first, any purchase payments the Contract Owner makes during that time period will increase the Current Income Benefit Base more than purchase payments made after that time
period. 


(5) 
The following new subsection is
added to the "7% Nationwide Lifetime Income Rider (formerly the 7% Lifetime Income Option)" section:  
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal
For contracts issued on or after ______, 2013, or the date of
state approval (whichever is later), after the first Contract Anniversary, the Contract Owner may request a one-time withdrawal ("Non-Lifetime Withdrawal") without initiating the lifetime income benefit under the 7% Nationwide L.inc Option. The
Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will not lock in the Lifetime Withdrawal Percentage and will not stop the 7% simple interest roll-up. However, the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will reduce the Current Income Benefit Base, and consequently, the Lifetime Withdrawal
Amount calculated for subsequent years. As with all withdrawals, a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will reduce the Contract Value and death benefit. In addition, it will be subject to the CDSC provisions of the contract. A Non-Lifetime Withdrawal cannot be
taken after the Contract Owner initiates the Lifetime Withdrawals.
A Non-Lifetime Withdrawal will cause a reduction to three
factors used to calculate the Lifetime Withdrawal Amount: (1) the Current Income Benefit Base; (2) the Original Income Benefit Base (resulting in the Adjusted Roll-up Income Benefit Base); and (3) Subsequent purchase payments and Purchase Payment
Credits applied before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal. All three factors are reduced by a figure representing the proportional amount of the withdrawal, as follows: 


Reduction
 to Current Income Benefit Base 
=
 

 Gross dollar amount of the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal 
X
 
Current
 Income Benefit Base prior to the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal 

Contract
 Value (prior to the Non- Lifetime Withdrawal)

=
 
Gross
 dollar amount of the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal 
X
 
Subsequent
 purchase payments and Purchase Payment Credits applied before the Non-Lifetime Withdrawal 

Contract
 Value (prior to the Non- Lifetime Withdrawal)  
All Non-Lifetime Withdrawal requests must be made on a
Nationwide form which is available by contacting the Service Center. If the Contract Owner requests a withdrawal without using the Nationwide form, the withdrawal request will be treated as a Lifetime Withdrawal
request and will not be treated as a request for a Non-Lifetime Withdrawal.

General Information and History
Nationwide Variable Account-II (the "Variable Account") is a
separate investment account of Nationwide Life Insurance Company ("Nationwide"). Nationwide is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in March 1929 with its Home Office at One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio
43215. Nationwide provides life insurance, annuities and retirement products. Nationwide is admitted to do business in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Nationwide is a member of the Nationwide group of companies and all of its
common stock is owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. ("NFS"), a holding company. Nationwide Corporation owns all of NFS's common stock and is a holding company, as well. All of Nationwide Corporation's common stock is held by Nationwide
Mutual Insurance Company (95.2%) and Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (4.8%), the ultimate controlling persons of the Nationwide group of companies. The Nationwide group of companies is one of America's largest insurance and financial
services family of companies, with combined assets of over $168.3 billion as of December 31, 2012.
Services
Nationwide, which has responsibility for administration of the
contracts and the Variable Account, maintains records of the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other pertinent information for each Contract Owner, the number and type of contract issued to each Contract Owner, and records with
respect to the Contract Value. The custodian of the
assets of the Variable Account is Nationwide. Nationwide will maintain a record of all purchases and redemptions of shares of the underlying mutual funds. Nationwide or its affiliates may have entered into agreements with the underlying mutual funds
and/or their affiliates. The agreements relate to services furnished by Nationwide or an affiliate of Nationwide. Some of the services provided include distribution of underlying fund prospectuses, semi-annual and annual fund reports, proxy
materials, and fund communications, as well as maintaining the websites and voice response systems necessary for Contract Owners to execute trades in the funds. Nationwide also acts as a limited agent for each underlying mutual fund for purposes of
accepting the trades. See Underlying Mutual Fund Payments located in the prospectus.
Distribution, Promotional, and Sales Expenses
In addition to or partially in lieu of commission, Nationwide
may pay the selling firms a marketing allowance, which is based on the firm's ability and demonstrated willingness to promote and market Nationwide's products. How any marketing allowance is spent is determined by the firm, but generally will be
used to finance firm activities, such as training and education, that may contribute to the promotion and marketing of Nationwide's products. Nationwide makes certain assumptions about the amount of marketing allowance it will pay and takes these
assumptions into consideration when it determines the charges that will be assessed under the contracts. For the contracts described in the prospectus, Nationwide assumed 0.75% (of the purchase payment amount) for marketing allowance when
determining the charges for the contracts. The actual amount of the marketing allowance may be higher or lower than this assumption. If the actual amount of marketing allowance paid is more than what was assumed, Nationwide will fund the difference.
Nationwide generally does not profit from any excess marketing allowance if the amount assumed was higher than what is actually paid. Any excess would be spent on additional marketing for the contracts. For more information about marketing allowance
or how a particular selling firm uses marketing allowances, consult with your registered representative.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To be filed by subsequent Post-Effective Amendment.
Purchase of Securities Being Offered
The contracts will be sold by licensed insurance agents in the
states where the contracts may be lawfully sold. Such agents will be registered representatives of broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
Underwriters
The contracts, which are offered continuously, are distributed
by Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC"), One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nationwide. For contracts issued in Michigan, all references to NISC will mean Nationwide Investment Svcs. Corporation.
No underwriting commissions have been paid by Nationwide to NISC for each of this Variable Account's last three fiscal years.

Advertising
Money Market Yields
Nationwide may advertise the "yield" and "effective yield" for
the money market Sub-Account. Yield and effective yield are annualized, which means that it is assumed that the underlying mutual fund generates the same level of net income throughout a year.
Yield is a measure of the net dividend and interest income
earned over a specific seven-day period (which period will be stated in the advertisement) expressed as a percentage of the offering price of the underlying mutual fund's units. The effective yield is calculated similarly, but reflects assumed
compounding, calculated under rules prescribed by the SEC. Thus, effective yield will be slightly higher than yield, due to the compounding.
Historical Performance of the Sub-Accounts
Nationwide will advertise historical performance of the
Sub-Accounts in accordance with SEC prescribed calculations. Performance information is annualized. However, if a Sub-Account has been available in the Variable Account for less than one year, the performance information for that Sub-Account is not
annualized. Performance information is based on
historical earnings and is not intended to predict or project future results.
Standardized performance will reflect the maximum Variable
Account charges possible under the contract. Non-standardized performance, which will be accompanied by standardized performance, will reflect other expense structures contemplated under the contract. The expense assumptions will be stated in the
advertisement. Additional Materials
Nationwide may provide information on various topics to owners
and prospective purchasers in advertising, sales literature, or other materials.
Performance Comparisons
Each Sub-Account may, from time to time, include in
advertisements the ranking of its performance figures compared with performance figures of other annuity contracts' Sub-Accounts with the same investment objectives which are created by Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar, Inc. or other
recognized ranking services. Annuity Payments

Item 28. Indemnification
Provision is made in Nationwide's Amended and Restated Code of
Regulations and expressly authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio, for indemnification by Nationwide of any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Nationwide, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the extent and under the circumstances permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling Nationwide pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Nationwide has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. Item

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' and Section 17(b) Applicants' Representations
1. NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL which is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (“NFS”). NWL is the depositor and sponsor of Accounts II, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and P-1 and VLI Accounts 2, 4, 7, and P-1. NLAIC is the depositor and sponsor of B, G, and P-A and VLI Account P-A.
2. All of the Separate Accounts are registered unit investment trusts used to issue one or more Contracts together with their respective Insurance Company. The file numbers for each Separate Account's registration under the Act and each Contract's registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) are set forth in the Application.
3. NVIT is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company of the series type, and it securities are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File Nos. 811-03213 and 002-73024). Two of these series, the NVIT—American Century NVIT Multi-Cap Value Fund and NVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (each an “NVIT Fund”), are the replacement funds (“New Funds” or “New Portfolios”) in the proposed Substitutions.Start Printed Page 66807

4. Nationwide Fund Advisors (“NFA”) currently serves as investment adviser to each of the NVIT Funds. NFA employs a subadvisory structure as part of its advisory strategy with respect to the NVIT Funds. Through an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, NVIT is exempt from Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 thereunder with respect to subadvisory agreements (the “Manager of Managers Order”).[1] 

5. Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:
No.Old fundOld classNVIT New fundNew class1American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.—American Century VP Value Fund (“Old Value Fund”)Class INVIT—American Century NVIT Multi Cap Value Fund (“New Multi Cap Value Fund”)Class I2Old Value FundClass IINew Multi Cap Value FundClass II3Fidelity Variable Insurance Products (“VIP”) Fund—VIP Contrafund Portfolio (“Old Contrafund Portfolio”)Initial ClassNVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (“New Large Cap Growth Fund”)Class I4Old Contrafund PortfolioService ClassNew Large Cap Growth FundClass I5Old Contrafund PortfolioService Class 2New Large Cap Growth FundClass II6Fidelity VIP Fund—VIP Growth Opportunities Portfolio (“Old Growth Opps.

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Start Printed Page 66808Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and Start Printed Page 66809New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the Start Printed Page 66810necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio Start Printed Page 66811securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports. As specified in Rule 17a-7(d), the Application states that no brokerage commission, fee (except for any customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by Rule 17a-7(e) and (f). The Application also states, “pursuant to Rule 17a-7(e)(3), during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any In-Kind Transactions occur, the Trust's Board of Trustees will review reports submitted by NFA in respect of such In-Kind Transactions in order to determine that all such In-Kind Transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein.” Finally, Applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with Rule 17a-7(g).
Conclusions
Section 26 Applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed Substitutions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

With a variable universal life policy, you can take advantage of potential economic growth because your policy value is invested in the stock market. Your policy also has the flexibility to adjust to your changing needs. Underlying sub-accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
However, it also puts greater responsibility on you - you assume the investment and mortality risks, and you select and monitor your own underlying investment options, instead of the insurance company doing it for you.
Your insurance needs may change if your personal situation changes, for example if you get married, have a child or get a promotion. Make sure that these strategies and products are suitable for your long-term life insurance needs. Also, make sure you are able to continue premium payments so your policy doesn’t lapse if the market goes down. If you take a loan, withdrawal or partial or whole surrender your death benefit may be reduced, your policy may lapse or you may face tax consequences.
There are fees and charges for variable life insurance, including a cost of insurance based on characteristics of the insured person such as gender, health and age. There may also be underlying fund charges and expenses, and additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit your individual needs.
Before purchasing a variable life insurance policy, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the policy and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They don't apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options. Underlying sub accounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. Both the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company. P.O. Box.182021 Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before investing, carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses contain this and other important information. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.

Advantages and disadvantages of variable life insuranceWith a variable universal life policy, you can take advantage of potential market growth because your policy value is invested in underlying sub-accounts which are subject to market fluctuations. Your policy also has the flexibility to adjust to your changing needs.However, a variable universal life policy puts greater responsibility on you .You assume the investment risk, and you select and monitor your own underlying investment options, instead of the insurance company doing it for you.Keep in mind that as your life changes (for example, marriage, birth of a child or a job promotion), so will your life insurance needs. Make sure that these strategies and products are suitable for your long-term life insurance needs. Also, make sure you are able to continue premium payments so your policy doesn’t lapse if the market goes down. If you take a loan, withdrawal or partial or whole surrender, your death benefit may be reduced, your policy may lapse or you may face tax consequences.There are fees and charges for variable life insurance, including a cost of insurance based on characteristics of the insured person such as gender, health and age. There may also be underlying fund charges and expenses, and additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit your individual needs.

Please read this important information
Keep in mind that investing involves market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Also, know that underlying investment options are only available in variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. They are not offered directly to the public.
Protections and guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing life insurance company.
Keep in mind that taking money from your policy immediately reduces both the cash value and the death benefit payable, and can cause the need for more premiums to be paid into the policy in the future. You should always take care to ensure that your life insurance needs continue to be met over time subsequent to taking cash from your policy.
Variable products are sold by prospectus. You can obtain the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company, P.O. Box 182021, Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus carefully and consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Investing involves risk.
Guarantees and protections are subject to Nationwide's claims-paying ability. They do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options.
Investment products are not FDIC-insured, may lose value and have no bank guarantee.
