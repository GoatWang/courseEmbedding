You say you’re addressing ring-chasing role players and not superstars like Kevin Durant, but each critique you present from outside sources like Barkley and Adam Silver are in response to Durant’s move, which is entirely different from that of West and Zaza. 
I think the “ring-chaser” you are exonerating is one that takes markedly less money to play on a championship favor. This is quite distinct from Durant, who took a modest pay cut to jump on the “gravy train” (in Chuck’s words). 
The tirade on Kevin Durant is that he is coming off a season in which he was as close as he’s ever been to returning to the Finals since 2011-12 with the team he already had. He is unable to lead a very talented and developed team past Golden State and failed to show up in numerous situations throughout the series. He faces an offseason in which he has the team he has developed with for his entire career, a slew of young pieces (the top 7 Thunder players in the postseason are all under 27) and a chance to ride again with this team and a very very legitimate chance to unseat Golden State next year. Instead, he hops to the Warriors who just sent him packing weeks prior.
People forget that not only does Durant make Golden State that much better, but he ruins a very deliberate long term plan from OKC. Years ago they let Harden walk because they know KD and Westbrook will have to get paid soon. They develop Reggie Jackson to the point where he becomes a key trade piece for Enes Kanter, who they also groomed and developed into a prolific big man. They work on Steven Adams until he becomes a fearsome center. They develop Serge Ibaka for years to the point that even after a relative down year, he is still a trade piece tradable for Victor Oladipo, who slots in perfectly as the missing piece on this team. It’s all careful and calculated for the Thunder. But now that Durant walks, Westbrook will probably be traded for crumbs because OKC knows he will walk next year if he’s not. There’s more than just a change of teams here. And all to play with a team that just got to the NBA Finals and took LeBron to 7 without you. Durant should want to come back with a fire in his belly and take out the Warriors. Instead he chooses to run from his problems and join them. You have got to be kidding me.

I think many people saw Winslow as the steal of the draft anywhere from the fourth spot to where was eventually taken at 10. Great value for the Heat here.

Great read. The Sports Guy opened the door for opinionated yet structured sports journalism, and anything he sets out to do in the future will be the cherry on top of a legendary career.
