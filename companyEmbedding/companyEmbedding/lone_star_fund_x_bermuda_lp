Lone Star Fund VI			

Lone Star Fund VI (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Fund VI (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively, “Lone Star Fund VI”), formed in December 2007, held their final closings in July 2008 with $7.5 billion in combined capital commitments.  Over its 24 month investment period, Lone Star Fund VI invested substantially all of its equity capital in 28 investments comprised of 79,210 assets with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $20.0 billion.  Transactions consummated by Lone Star Fund VI included investments in loans and securities, including single family residential, commercial real estate and consumer debt products and financially oriented operating companies.
Lone Star Fund VI invested primarily in the U.S. residential mortgage market as the scale of the distressed opportunity reached unprecedented levels following the failure of several prominent U.S. investment banks.  Utilizing a dedicated team of professionals based in New York, Lone Star Fund VI acquired in excess of $55 billion (face value) of mortgages and mortgage-related securities.  The collapse of the U.S. residential market also led to opportunities abroad that included Lone Star Fund VI’s acquisition of a large German financial institution.

DALLAS, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Funds today announced that it has completed the final closing for Lone Star Fund X (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Fund X (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSF X").  Total capital available is approximately $5.6 billion, which includes LSF X commitments and an anticipated co-investment from associated entities.
Commitments to LSF X exceeded LSF X's original target of $5 billion.








In April, Lone Star announced it had closed Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSREF V"), its fifth dedicated commercial real estate fund, at approximately $5.8 billion, exceeding its $5 billion fundraising target and reaching its $5.5 billion hard cap for third party commitments.
Lone Star, a global private equity firm, invests on behalf of its limited partners, which include institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, as well as foundations and endowments that support medical research, higher education, and other philanthropic causes.  
Lone Star is a highly disciplined, value-driven investor that focuses on opportunities that emerge during periods of market dislocation, often providing liquidity to markets in the aftermath of a financial crisis.  Lone Star focuses on businesses, sellers, and assets that require capital support and management direction to succeed post-crisis. In this context, Lone Star considers a broad scope of markets, industries, and opportunities through equity and debt investments in value-oriented assets, real estate and real estate-related assets, control investments in operating companies, and securitized products. 
Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has organized seventeen private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments exceeding $70 billion.
