      Sodium Carbonate, Anhydrous 
        





Company:

OCI Chemical Corporation



Sodium Carbonate, Anhydrous, known chemically as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), has been in use for thousands of years. Soda Ash occurs in many kinds of mineral waters and in mineral deposits of certain springs and lake brines. The richest and most commonly found source of Soda Ash is trona, a mix of sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and water. Although trona can be found in many places, the world’s purest, largest and most accessible deposit is in Wyoming’s Green River Basin.At OCI Wyoming’s 3.25 million short ton facility, trona is mined using the “Room and Pillar Method” and conveyed to the surface to be refined into dense soda ash. Quality control is maintained through detailed instrumentation, laboratory testing and rigid supervision. Our extensive industry experience, knowledgeable staff, modern laboratories, ISO 9001 (2008 Standard) certification and highly efficient processing facilities combine to provide OCI customers with superior service and support. Soda Ash is used in a variety of industries and applications including Food Manufacturing (i.e. yeast, baking soda, etc.)

OCI Chemical Corp. and Invensys enter into five-year global Performance Alliance agreement 











OCI Chemical Corp. and Invensys enter into five-year global Performance Alliance agreement 
















                                              FOXBORO, MASSACHUSETTS, USA  March 7, 2002  Invensys Production Management(Foxboro, Massachusetts) and OCI Chemical Corp.(Shelton, Connecticut) today announced that the two companies have signed a five-year global Performance Alliance.  The objective of the Performance Alliance is to utilize Invensys real-time performance measures and advanced automation technology to help OCI continuously improve the economic performance of the companys existing global manufacturing assets.  OCI is the one of the worlds largest suppliers of sodium percarbonate, an environmentally friendly bleaching agent used in detergents; as well as one of the largest suppliers of soda ash, a key ingredient in the manufacture of glass.   Under the alliance agreement, the two companies will work together closely to jointly identify potential areas for improvement, implement performance improvement strategies, and measure and quantify the economic benefits to OCI utilizing Invensys patented Dynamic Performance Measures (DPM) methodology.  Invensys fees will be based on this incremental benefit. I view this innovative Performance Alliance with Invensys as a rare opportunity to shape our future by transforming the traditional supplier/customer relationship in a way that benefits both companies beyond what we could otherwise expect to achieve, commented Richard Lissa, OCI Chemical Corporations director of procurement and logistics.Were absolutely convinced that, by applying automation technology more effectively, we can help forward-thinking companies such as OCI to improve the performance of their existing manufacturing assets toward achieving specific business objectives,  said Peter Martin, vice president of marketing at Invensys Production Management division.  The alliance will build on the existing relationship between Invensys and OCI , under which Invensys has successfully automated production lines at OCIs world-scale soda ash manufacturing facility in Green River, Wyoming with Foxboro automation systems and field instrumentation.OCI Chemical Corp. is a subsidiary of DC Chemicals, an integrated chemical products provider whose principal activities are the manufacture and distribution of basic, fine, petrochemicals and coal chemicals.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.
