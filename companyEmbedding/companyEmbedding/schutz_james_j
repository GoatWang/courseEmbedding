How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in New Jersey:













Does James J Schutz carry a valid contracting license?



The state of New Jersey does not offer a contractor license designation. State law does require contractors to register annually with the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. This registration must be prominently displayed on all of the contractors commercial vehicles, places of business, and business related documents, contracts, and correspondence. The registration number must begin with the letters HIC reg.# 
James J Schutz currently holds license IR675692 , which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring James J Schutz



New Jersey state law requires all contractors to maintain an active general liability policy. It is always a good idea to hire contractors with both general liability and workers' compensation insurance policies. Request copies of both insurance certificates before any work begins.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in New Jersey, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
