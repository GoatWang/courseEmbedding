                                 was trading for P. Chouteau, Jr., & Co. at their Scotts Bluff post, Fort John. One letter of 1830 is by Lucien Fontenelle,
                                 then his partner in the fur trade; a few accounts for 1819-1820 reflect Drip's earlier St. Louis mercantile partnership with

                              Bahrain's geopolitical circumstances do not inspire a strong sense of comfort or complacency: a small island state with a
                                 significant religious fracture among its populace, situated amidst much larger and occasionally acquisitive neighbors within
                                 a volatile region that supplies a finite mineral essential to global industrial development. Bahrain's ruling Al-Khalifa family
                                 has consequently become particularly sensitive to political or security developments in surrounding countries that could sweep
                                 across Bahrain's shores and upend its domestic equilibrium

                              The report presents the results of laboratory, environmental, and endurance testing directed toward the determination of the
                                 effect of direct burning of emulsified JP-4 fuel in a gas turbine engine and the handling and pumping of emulsified JP-4 fuel.
                                 Engine operation, including starting and transient operation, with EF4-101 emulsified fuel was essentially the same as that
                                 with liquid JP-4 fuel during all phases of testing. Engine testing was terminated when a 'hot section' corrosion problem,
                                 generated by one of the additives in the emulsified fuel, was encountered. The use of emulsified fuel will require a new technology
                                 in the design of fuel filters, fuel pumps, fuel flow measuring devices, and fuel handling practices

                              The US is in the midst of an extraordinary national debate concerning the appropriate policy mix with which to address the
                                 challenges posed by Iraq. The iterative presentation of the US Administration's approach to "settling" the Iraq question lends
                                 itself to measurement against a decision model that factors in policy ends, means, ways, constraints, opportunities, costs,
                                 and risks to determine if all critical variables have been considered and properly weighted in the US decision process. Using
                                 such a decision template, this paper will propose that the US approach to Iraq should focus primarily on curtailing Iraq's
                                 weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program through a sequential mix of coercive diplomacy and limited military force as required.
                                 Such an approach is most likely to achieve relevant US national security objectives while minimizing the US cost in lives
