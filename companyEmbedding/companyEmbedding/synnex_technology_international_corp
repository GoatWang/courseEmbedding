FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Distribution Services
  In our Technology Solutions segment, we purchase peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, networking equipment, consumer electronics and complementary products from our primary suppliers and sell them to our reseller and retail customers. We perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national and regional retailers.
In Technology Solutions, we also provide comprehensive IT solutions in key vertical markets such as government and health care, and we provide specialized service offerings that increase efficiencies in the areas of print management, renewals, networking, logistics services, and supply chain management. Additionally, within our Technology Solutions segment, we provide our customers with systems design and integration solutions for data center servers and storage solutions built specifically to our customers’ data center environments. We distribute more than 30,000 technology products (as measured by active SKUs) from more than 300 IT, CE, and OEM suppliers to more than 20,000 resellers, system integrators, and retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and China. We combine our core strengths in distribution with our customer-engagement services to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market, cost minimization, real-time linkages in the supply chain, and after-market product support.
