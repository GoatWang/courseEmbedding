Beauty For a Purpose






Share This Page

This is the company that puts mascara on lashes and food on tables. That fights wrinkles with one hand and breast cancer with the other. That knows the value of a perfect lip, but still opens its mouth and speaks out against domestic violence and for women's financial independence. This is the company that not only brings beauty to doors, but also opens them. The company that supports 6 million Representatives worldwide. This is Avon. The company that for 130 years has stood for beauty, innovation, optimism and, above all, for women.

Everyday, Avon brings beauty to the lives of women all over the world. At Avon, beauty means finding the right lipstick shade for a customer; providing an earnings opportunity so a woman can support her family; and enabling a woman to get her first mammogram. Beauty is about women looking and feeling their best. It’s about championing economic empowerment and improving the lives of women around the world. 
Avon is a company steeped in tradition, grounded by its core values and principles as well as its vision "to be the company that best understands and satisfies the product, service and self-fulfillment needs of women – globally."
Avon is the Company that for 130 years has proudly stood for beauty, innovation, optimism and, above all, for women. Avon products include well-recognized and beloved brands, such as ANEW, Avon Color, Avon Care, Skin-So-Soft, and Advance Techniques.

Experience Avon's History
In 1886, 34 years before women in the U.S. earned the right to vote, our founder, David H. McConnell, helped give them the chance to earn an independent income.
He didn’t set out to create a beauty company. In fact, McConnell was a traveling book salesperson and offered beauty products as an additional perk to his female customers. He saw that these women were more interested in the free perfume samples than the books – and that many of them stayed home while their husbands went off to work. Since women had a passion for his products and loved networking with other women, McConnell was inspired to recruit them as Sales Representatives. From a small New York City office, McConnell himself mixed the company's first fragrances.
This began Avon’s long history of empowering women around the globe.
95 Years before the first woman was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court ...
77 Years before the first woman traveled into space ...
76 Years before the first woman took the reins of a Fortune 500 company ...
34 Years before women in the U.S. had the right to vote ...
17 Years before the first woman won the Nobel Prize ...
Avon offered women the opportunity to be CEOs of their own businesses and control their economic destinies.
Avon has been empowering women for 130 years.

Avon Products reports surprise loss while sales rise as expected
Avon Products Inc.  reported a first-quarter loss that narrowed to $36.5 million, or 10 cents a share, from a loss of $165.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss per share was 7 cents, while the FactSet consensus was for earnings per share of 1 cent. Revenue rose 2% to $1.33 billion from $1.31 billion, matching the FactSet consensus of $1.33 billion, as better-than-expected North Latin America sales offset misses in Europe, Middle East & Africa and South Latin America. The beauty products company expects 2017 revenue to grow in the "low single-digits" percentage range from last year, while the FactSet consensus of $5.80 billion implies growth of 1.5%. For 2017, the company said it will focus its transformation plan, which was initiated in January 2016, on investment in media and social selling. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has shed 7.7% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board. Recently, Avon has struggled with the global sales falling for five straight years and North American revenues falling 18% in 2014.[7]
In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board.

In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]

Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes.

Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]

The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]

In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]

Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary.

Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board. Recently, Avon has struggled with the global sales falling for five straight years and North American revenues falling 18% in 2014.[7]
In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board. Recently, Avon has struggled with the global sales falling for five straight years and North American revenues falling 18% in 2014.[7]
In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board.

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

Avon Products, Inc, known as Avon, is an American international manufacturer and direct selling company in beauty, household, and personal care categories. Avon had annual sales of $10.0 billion worldwide in 2013.[2]
It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives, is the second largest direct selling enterprise in the world (after Amway).[4] Avon Products is a multi-level marketing company.[5] The company's CEO is Sherilyn S. McCoy, who was appointed to the position in April 2012.[6] The former CEO, Andrea Jung, became the executive chairman of the board. Recently, Avon has struggled with the global sales falling for five straight years and North American revenues falling 18% in 2014.[7]
In 2016, Avon completed the sale of the remainder of its American business. All of its operations are now outside the United States. As part of a three-year plan, Avon will also move its headquarters to the United Kingdom.[8]

History[edit]
David H. McConnell[edit]
David H. McConnell was first a struggling door-to-door salesman who used to sell books to New York homes. In September 1886,[9] he decided to sell perfumes rather than books. He started the new business in a small office at 126 Chambers Street, Manhattan, New York. McConnell changed the company name in 1892 when his business partner suggested he call it the "California Perfume Company". His business partner was living in California at the time and suggested the name because of the abundance of flowers in California.[10]
In 1894, Alexander D. Henderson, Vice-President and Treasurer, joined the company and helped to shape its policies and assist in its growth.[11] On June 16, 1909, McConnell and Henderson signed an agreement of Corporation for the California Perfume Company in the state of New Jersey.[12] On January 28, 1916, the California Perfume Company was incorporated in the state of New York. McConnell, Henderson, and William Scheele were listed as company officials.[13]
Early Avon trademark[edit]




The drawing stylized word AVON mark is an expired trademark at the USPTO, and owned by Avon Products, Inc.


The California Perfume Company, Inc. of New York filed their first trademark application for Avon on June 3, 1932 with the USPTO. Part of the description for goods and services provided to the USPTO included "perfumes, toilet waters, powder and rouge compacts, lipsticks", and other toiletry products. First use and commercial use for Avon by the California Perfume Company was on September 1, 1929. Registration was granted on August 30, 1932.
International expansion[edit]
Avon sells products in over 100 countries. Brazil is the company's largest market, passing the United States in 2010. Avon entered the Chinese market in 1990. Direct selling was outlawed in China in 1998,[14] which forced Avon to sell only through physical stores called Beauty Boutiques. The ban was lifted in 2001, and the company received a license for direct selling in 2006.[4]
88% of Avon's 2013 revenue (around $10 billion) came from overseas markets.[14]
Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
Avon purchased Silpada, a direct seller of silver jewelry, in 2010 for $650 million.[4] In May 2012, perfume company Coty, Inc. offered $24.75 a share for Avon, which was nearly 20 percent above Avon's stock price at the time. While Fox Business Network reported that Avon delayed the process and Coty withdrew its offer,[15] earlier reports said that Avon rejected the bid, stating "At the time, the board concluded, and it still believes, that Coty's indication of interest is opportunistic and not in the best interest of Avon's shareholders."[16][17][18]
In March, 2016, Cerberus Capital Management paid $435 million in cash for preferred stock in Avon Products. This move was the conclusion of a deal initiated in December 2015, when Avon sold 80.1 percent of it North American Business to Cerberus for $170 million. The total value of the deal was $605 million. The investment resulted in Cerberus having an almost 17 percent stake in Avon Products.[19][20]
Business model[edit]




An Avon training center in the Bronx


Avon uses both door-to-door sales people ("Avon ladies" primarily, and as well as some men) and brochures to advertise its products.[21] The first Avon lady was Persis Foster Eames Albee. Avon operates training centers for potential representatives. Some Avon training centers have a small retail section with skin care products, such as creams, serums, makeup, and washes. Avon uses multi-level marketing to recruit sales representatives, who sell beauty products, jewelry, accessories and clothing.[22]

Avon representatives are considered an independent sales representatives running her or his own business. Some of the brand-names used by the company include Avon, Avon Naturals, Skin-So-Soft and Mark.[citation needed] According to the U.S. government Avon has 5 million to 6 million sales representatives operating in over 100 countries as of 2014. Avon and its subsidiaries have 40,000 to 50,000 employees, 6,000 of which are in the United States.[14]
Avon was an early member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association, which was founded in 1910. The company left the association in 2014, saying that the trade group was not paying enough attention to the industry as a whole.[22]
Celebrity beauty ambassadors[edit]
Mark.[23] cosmetics, an Avon fashion and beauty brand, has featured multiple celebrity ambassadors throughout its development in 2003. Notable ambassadors include Lauren Conrad, Ashley Greene, and currently Lucy Hale.[24]
Representative Life[edit]
Avon Repfest[edit]
Avon hosts an annual Repfest, a 3-day event open to all representatives at a fee. The Repfest serves as an opportunity to inspire representatives from across the country by giving them a chance to network and participate in business-building training seminars.[25] In August 2016, the Repfest was hosted at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino's convention center in Las Vegas, NV.[26] In August 2017, it will be hosted at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, TN.[27]
Avon Foundation[edit]
In addition to its corporate pursuits, the Avon corporation is involved in philanthropic causes. The Avon Foundation for Women describes itself as the largest corporate philanthropy dedicated to women's causes globally.[28] The Avon Foundation awards scholarships for Avon representatives and family members. Avon founded the Avon Foundation for Women with its first grant, a $400 scholarship, in 1955.
Additionally, the company's Speak Out Against Domestic Violence program aims to reduce domestic violence.[29] Through 2012, Avon global philanthropy, led by the Avon Foundation, reports having donated more than $910 million in more than 50 countries.[30]
Breast cancer[edit]




The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer


Beginning in the early 1990s, Avon also began donating towards breast cancer research and care, through the Avon Breast Cancer Crusade and the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, a series of U.S. based charity walks.[31] Before 2003, the Walk was a function of Pallotta Teamworks, with Avon being the beneficiary. Since 2003, the charity reports that more than 180,000 Walk participants have raised $472 million for the cause.[32][33]
Restatements[edit]
In Sep 14, 2000, Avon restated its financial statements to reflect the additional write off as of March 31, 1999 of all capitalized costs, associated with the FIRST project as of that date and a reversal of the charge recorded in the third quarter of 2001. In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.[34]
Controversy[edit]
Chinese corruption charges[edit]
Since at least 2008, the conduct of various employees and executives of Avon has been investigated for possible violations of the law, including possible bribery and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[35]
Avon began a probe of its China division after allegations of bribery in June 2008.[36] At least four executives, both in Asia and in the United States, were suspended in 2010,[36] and later fired for their roles in the activities being investigated.[37] According to The New York Times, Avon has spent over $170 million on legal fees and costs related to the investigation: $59 million in 2009 and $95 million in 2010, and $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2011.[38] The Times reported that the final tally may be close to $250 million, after which Avon would report the findings to the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and try to negotiate the penalties that those entities may impose.[38] On February 24, 2011, Avon filed a report with the Securities and Exchange commission highlighting the investigation as a corporate risk factor that could cause investor loss.[39]
In 2014 Avon settled the bribery charges for a total of $135 million; $68 million in criminal penalties, with the remainder in interest, disgorgement, and fines from a civil case brought by the SEC.[14][40]
Animal testing[edit]
Avon vowed in 1989 that as a company located in the United States, they would no longer participate in animal testing.[41] As an ambassador of non-animal testing methods, Avon is working globally to introduce safer methods of testing cosmetics that do not require animals. These methods include in vitro testing, computer simulations, and testing cosmetics on human volunteers.[41]
Although Avon does not practice animal testing of its cosmetics that are sold in the United States, certain specialty products do require extensive testing in other countries. In China, specialty products that require degrees of animal testing include but are not limited to: sunscreen products, whitening/pigmentation products, and hair dye/perm/ or growth products.[41] Due to laws mandated by different countries, Avon is forced to test those specific cosmetics on animals due to laws in China. Laws in China (and other countries) require companies to pay for animal testing through a commercial business in order to sell their product in that country.[42] Because Avon is not globally animal-testing free, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or PETA has not included Avon on their cruelty-free list.[43][44]
Labour harassment in Turkey[edit]
In 2016, Avon's branch in Turkey (Gebze industrial zone near Istanbul) has been alleged of discrimination against women and union workers.[45]
Avon France[edit]
On 14 October 2013, Avon announced the closure of its branch in Paris, France at the end of that month. Its French representatives accused it of keeping the workers in the dark for months and not acting in line with the companies publicly stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication".[46] As of January 2014, Avon France has begun receivership.[47]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
