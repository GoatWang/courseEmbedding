				Ranchmate			



 
 
 
 
 
PLP's Ranchmate product line introduced the world to innovative fencing products that are changing the way wire fences are built and repaired across America. Manufactured in the U.S. by Preformed Line Products, Ranchmate enables farmers and ranchers to construct and mend wire fences like utility linemen have built and fixed overhead conductor lines for decades. 
Based on proprietary technology, Ranchmate products are stronger, more durable, safer and measurably superior to anything else on the market. They are so easy to install that almost anyone can do it.
