Company[edit]




O-I Location in Holzminden, Germany


While legally known as Owens-Illinois, Inc.,[4] the company changed its trade name to O-I in 2005 to group its global operations under a single, cross-language and cross-culture brand name.
The company's headquarters were previously located in One SeaGate, Toledo, Ohio, a local landmark. The headquarters were moved in late 2006 to the Levis Commons complex in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company is the successor to the Owens Bottle Company founded in 1903 by Michael Joseph Owens, who made the first automated bottle-making machine, and Edward Drummond Libbey. In 1929, the Owens Bottle Company merged with Illinois Glass Company to become Owens-Illinois, Inc.[5]
Until July 2007, the company was also a worldwide manufacturer of plastics packaging with operations in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Plastics packaging products manufactured by O-I included containers, closures, and prescription containers. In July 2007 O-I completed the sale of its entire plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC, a UK listed packaging manufacturer.
O-I was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from June 1, 1959 until March 12, 1987. The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in January 2009. O-I was one of the original S&P 500 companies in 1957. It was removed in 1987 (after purchase by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts), added in 1991 and removed again in 2000.[6]
In October 2010, Owens-Illinois Venezuela C.A was expropriated by President Hugo Chávez.[7]
In May 2015, O-I made an offer to purchase the food and beverage glass container business of Mexican company Vitro for $2.15 billion.[8] Timing for finalization has not been announced.
Partnership with NEG[edit]
O-I partnered with NEG (Nippon Electric Glass), to produce glass television screens at its Columbus, Ohio and Pittston, Pennsylvania plants in the 1970s through the mid-1990s before allowing Techneglas to take over the operations.
Environmental Issues[edit]
Although it has not made an asbestos-containing materials since 1958, Owens-Illinois invented, tested, manufactured and distributed KAYLO asbestos containing thermal pipe insulation from 1948 through 1958.[9] Owens-Illinois remains a named defendant in numerous asbestos litigation matters throughout the U.S.[10] Some claims in these cases allege that Owens-Illinois was a participant in the seventh annual Saranac Seminar[11] when the cancer-causing potential of asbestos was studied in the 1950s.[12]

Company[edit]




O-I Location in Holzminden, Germany


While legally known as Owens-Illinois, Inc.,[4] the company changed its trade name to O-I in 2005 to group its global operations under a single, cross-language and cross-culture brand name.
The company's headquarters were previously located in One SeaGate, Toledo, Ohio, a local landmark. The headquarters were moved in late 2006 to the Levis Commons complex in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company is the successor to the Owens Bottle Company founded in 1903 by Michael Joseph Owens, who made the first automated bottle-making machine, and Edward Drummond Libbey. In 1929, the Owens Bottle Company merged with Illinois Glass Company to become Owens-Illinois, Inc.[5]
Until July 2007, the company was also a worldwide manufacturer of plastics packaging with operations in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Plastics packaging products manufactured by O-I included containers, closures, and prescription containers. In July 2007 O-I completed the sale of its entire plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC, a UK listed packaging manufacturer.
O-I was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from June 1, 1959 until March 12, 1987. The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in January 2009. O-I was one of the original S&P 500 companies in 1957. It was removed in 1987 (after purchase by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts), added in 1991 and removed again in 2000.[6]
In October 2010, Owens-Illinois Venezuela C.A was expropriated by President Hugo Chávez.[7]
In May 2015, O-I made an offer to purchase the food and beverage glass container business of Mexican company Vitro for $2.15 billion.[8] Timing for finalization has not been announced.
Partnership with NEG[edit]
O-I partnered with NEG (Nippon Electric Glass), to produce glass television screens at its Columbus, Ohio and Pittston, Pennsylvania plants in the 1970s through the mid-1990s before allowing Techneglas to take over the operations.
Environmental Issues[edit]
Although it has not made an asbestos-containing materials since 1958, Owens-Illinois invented, tested, manufactured and distributed KAYLO asbestos containing thermal pipe insulation from 1948 through 1958.[9] Owens-Illinois remains a named defendant in numerous asbestos litigation matters throughout the U.S.[10] Some claims in these cases allege that Owens-Illinois was a participant in the seventh annual Saranac Seminar[11] when the cancer-causing potential of asbestos was studied in the 1950s.[12]

Owens-Illinois, Inc.

Company History
Whether you know it or not, you probably come into contact  with Owens-Illinois products every day. That’s because one of every two glass  containers worldwide is manufactured by Owens-Illinois, its affiliates or its  licensees. The world’s largest glass container-maker, the company is based in  Perrysburg, Ohio, and employs some 24,000 workers in 21 countries.
Owens-Illinois got its start in 1903 when a glass blower by  the name of Michael J. Owens invented what would become revolutionary  technology in the glass field: the automatic bottle-making machine. It seems  strange now, but it wasn’t very long ago that it was extremely difficult to make  glass products uniformly, without significant variations in their shape and  thickness. Owens’ invention changed that, making the company – then known as  the Owens Bottle Company – among the first to offer containers of a consistent  shape and size. 
Owens Bottle Company merged with Illinois Glass Company in  1929, and the resulting company was named Owens-Illinois Glass Company. It  wasn’t long before the company began manufacturing plastics – Owens-Illinois  made its first plastic closure in 1932 – and in 1965, company leaders decided  to change its name to the more inclusive Owens-Illinois, Inc. The company’s  name changed again in 2005, when Owens-Illinois changed its trade name to O-I to  consolidate its operations under one brand name that would work in any language.  (The company is still legally known as Owens-Illinois, however.)
For decades, Owens-Illinois’ plastics division manufactured  containers, closures, trigger sprayers, prescription containers and other  plastic products. But in 2007, the company sold that division, and today it  focuses exclusively on glass. A Fortune 500 company, Owens-Illinois had  revenues of $6.6 billion in 2010.
Products  Manufactured by Owens-Illinois that Contained Asbestos
For a short time in the 1940s and 1950s, Owens-Illinois  manufactured a line of high-temperature, calcium-silicate pipe and boiler  insulation under the product name “Kaylo.” The company manufactured Kaylo at least from 1946 to 1958, at which point Owens-Illinois sold its Kaylo  division to Owens-Corning, an Ohio-based fiberglass company. (In fact,  Owens-Corning got its start in the 1930s when researchers at Owens-Illinois  decided to experiment with glass fiber products.)
Like many insulation products at the time, Kaylo contained  asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral that can be broken down into long,  stringy fibers. In the late 1800s, the United States’ growing industrial sector  realized those fibers could be very useful – they were strong, durable,  versatile; they were excellent insulators and helped prevent the spread of  fire. Before long, asbestos was being mined around the world and shipped in  massive quantities to U.S. soil, where it was added to everything from  cigarette filters to car  brakes to spackle. 
Of course, asbestos didn’t magically get into these products  by itself. Millions of workers handled the substance daily on assembly lines,  laboratories and construction sites, never realizing that by doing so they were irreparably damaging their  health. Now we know that exposure  to asbestos causes respiratory diseases like asbestosis, a chronic inflammation  of the lungs, and mesothelioma, a formerly rare type of cancer caused only by  asbestos exposure. Diseases like these are caused when asbestos particles  become released into the air and are inhaled into a person’s lungs. This  happens most often during the manufacturing process, when raw asbestos fibers  can easily become airborne, or when asbestos products age and deteriorate,  releasing dust into the environment.
Products manufactured by Owens-Illinois that contained  asbestos include, but are not limited to:

Kaylo Insulation (manufactured by Owens-Illinois  from 1946-1958; later manufactured by Owens-Corning until 1975)

Occupations at Risk  of Asbestos Exposure
Anyone who worked with or near Kaylo insulation products  between 1946 and 1975 may be at risk of being diagnosed with mesothelioma or another asbestos-related disease. Those most likely to be affected are  insulation contractors, construction workers, boilermakers,  roofers, plumbers or others who came into contact with asbestos-containing insulation on a job  site – especially during the often-dusty installation or demolition processes.  Factory workers who manufactured Kaylo products in Owens-Illinois or  Owens-Corning factories were also at a high risk of exposure. 
But the reach of these products goes farther still.  Churches, factories, apartment buildings – any building that utilized Kaylo  insulation on their pipes or in their boiler rooms could have posed a risk to  the people inside. And unfortunately, there is evidence that asbestos exposure  risk can travel; that is, workers who brought home asbestos dust at the end of  the day on their clothing, shoes or hair could have put their loved ones at  risk by secondhand contact.
Recent  News
As of May 2011, Owens-Illinois has been named in thousands  of lawsuits by plaintiffs who say their health suffered after they were exposed  to asbestos in the company’s products. As of December 31, 2009, the company  reported that it had 7,000 asbestos claims pending and had resolved approximately  10,000 claims the previous year alone.

Asbestos Exposure









Many American workers, across a variety of industries, were exposed to asbestos on the job. As a result, they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma.
In this section, learn about the history of asbestos use, about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them.  Find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure.  Learn which job sites across the United States were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos.
What is Asbestos?

Long considered a miracle material, asbestos boasts excellent fire- and heat- resistant properties. This naturally-occurring mineral, now known to be a human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), has a history that dates back to ancient Greece. Asbestos was used as a building material, even as far back as during the Roman Empire. Asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles.
During the Industrial Revolution, asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the United States. Asbestos was used not only in factories, but also in oil refineries, chemical plants, on railroad cars, and in shipyards. Asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives, to line tanks and ovens in refineries, and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships, from engine rooms to galleys. As the twentieth century progressed, more uses for asbestos were found. It was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles, insulated America’s new skyscrapers, and was used extensively in the construction industry, where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds, cements, roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, siding, stucco, plaster, and much more. Those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestos-heavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products.
By the middle of the twentieth century, it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems. Asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma. This asbestos-related cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium. This thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity. Asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface. This scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop.
Despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos, historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous, yet continued to allow its use. Over time, as stories of sick employees became commonplace, the American government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos.

Asbestos Exposure in the United States

Exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites, in shipyards, aboard navy vessels, and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings. People working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk. In addition, teachers, students, and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products, such as ceiling or floor tiles. Equally at risk are families of these workers, as asbestos often was carried home on clothing.

If you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used, you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma.

Different Types of Asbestos Exposure

Military Exposure
Asbestos was used across all branches of the military for  many years. Navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving  on ships (aircraft  carriers, destroyers, submarines, battleships, warships,  etc.) in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country. Army  veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and  while working on military vehicles. Air Force veterans were exposed while  working with military aircraft. Marine Corps veterans that spent time at sea  aboard Navy ships were exposed to asbestos. All veterans exposed to asbestos  have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial and Industrial Exposure
Many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and  commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer.  The types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries, power  plants, steel  mills and chemical plants to name a few. They all have “high heat”  environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required,  be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective  clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas (i.e.  fire-proof gloves and aprons). Today, even though the use of asbestos has been  banned in the United States, many existing industrial and commercial structures  may still contain a certain level of asbestos. It is important that appropriate  safety precautions be taken, where necessary, to prevent harmful exposure and  to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial Product Exposure
Do-it-yourself home renovation enthusiasts, as well as those  who worked in the construction trade, may have been exposed to asbestos while  working with popular building and construction products. Many of these products  were made with asbestos through the late 1970’s as the projects they were to be  used in required that they be heat and fire resistant. They included insulation,  roofing material, siding, joint  compound, ceiling tiles, flooring and more. Unfortunately when any of these  products were cut, sawed filed, or sanded, asbestos fibers were released into  the air. In the majority of cases, those working with the products did not use  appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information  about the health hazards of asbestos for many years. Today, as a result,  construction workers and do-it-yourselfers are at risk for developing  mesothelioma or other asbestos-related  diseases.
Second Hand Exposure
Direct, on-the-job asbestos exposure did not affect American  workers alone. Their family members were also at risk of developing an  asbestos-related disease as a result of second  hand asbestos exposure. This type of exposure occurred when workers brought  asbestos fibers home on their hair, clothing or shoes at the end of the work  day. Those responsible for laundering their work clothes, day in and day out,  were most commonly affected, but even small children who spent time with their parent  before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at  risk of developing an asbestos-related illness.
Talc Exposure
Talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries. Talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe, but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits. Due to this, some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos. While talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure, some consumer products, namely baby powder and, more recently, children’s art supplies, have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users, mostly women, to be exposed to asbestos. Today, products using talc are tested for asbestos, but that was not always the case. Because mesothelioma has a long latency period, miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestos-containing talc products.

Unions Protect Workers from Asbestos Exposure

 Throughout the United States and across the world, hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries, from steel workers to plumbers, to electricians.  Unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job. Unions have organized witnesses for court cases, have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma, and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by mega-companies to compensate asbestos victims.

Compensation for Workers Exposed to Asbestos

If you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure, you may be entitled to compensation.  Each state has its own deadlines, called statutes of limitations, which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits.

Owens-Illinois Inc. is a Fortune 500 company that specializes in container glass products. It is one of the world's leading manufacturers of packaging products, holding the position of largest manufacturer of glass containers in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe (after acquiring BSN Glasspack in 2004 [3]). Approximately one of every two glass containers made worldwide is made by O-I, its affiliates, or its licensees.[citation needed]

Company[edit]




O-I Location in Holzminden, Germany


While legally known as Owens-Illinois, Inc.,[4] the company changed its trade name to O-I in 2005 to group its global operations under a single, cross-language and cross-culture brand name.
The company's headquarters were previously located in One SeaGate, Toledo, Ohio, a local landmark. The headquarters were moved in late 2006 to the Levis Commons complex in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company is the successor to the Owens Bottle Company founded in 1903 by Michael Joseph Owens, who made the first automated bottle-making machine, and Edward Drummond Libbey. In 1929, the Owens Bottle Company merged with Illinois Glass Company to become Owens-Illinois, Inc.[5]
Until July 2007, the company was also a worldwide manufacturer of plastics packaging with operations in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Plastics packaging products manufactured by O-I included containers, closures, and prescription containers. In July 2007 O-I completed the sale of its entire plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC, a UK listed packaging manufacturer.
O-I was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from June 1, 1959 until March 12, 1987. The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in January 2009. O-I was one of the original S&P 500 companies in 1957. It was removed in 1987 (after purchase by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts), added in 1991 and removed again in 2000.[6]
In October 2010, Owens-Illinois Venezuela C.A was expropriated by President Hugo Chávez.[7]
In May 2015, O-I made an offer to purchase the food and beverage glass container business of Mexican company Vitro for $2.15 billion.[8] Timing for finalization has not been announced.
Partnership with NEG[edit]
O-I partnered with NEG (Nippon Electric Glass), to produce glass television screens at its Columbus, Ohio and Pittston, Pennsylvania plants in the 1970s through the mid-1990s before allowing Techneglas to take over the operations.
Environmental Issues[edit]
Although it has not made an asbestos-containing materials since 1958, Owens-Illinois invented, tested, manufactured and distributed KAYLO asbestos containing thermal pipe insulation from 1948 through 1958.[9] Owens-Illinois remains a named defendant in numerous asbestos litigation matters throughout the U.S.[10] Some claims in these cases allege that Owens-Illinois was a participant in the seventh annual Saranac Seminar[11] when the cancer-causing potential of asbestos was studied in the 1950s.[12]

Company[edit]




O-I Location in Holzminden, Germany


While legally known as Owens-Illinois, Inc.,[4] the company changed its trade name to O-I in 2005 to group its global operations under a single, cross-language and cross-culture brand name.
The company's headquarters were previously located in One SeaGate, Toledo, Ohio, a local landmark. The headquarters were moved in late 2006 to the Levis Commons complex in Perrysburg, Ohio. The company is the successor to the Owens Bottle Company founded in 1903 by Michael Joseph Owens, who made the first automated bottle-making machine, and Edward Drummond Libbey. In 1929, the Owens Bottle Company merged with Illinois Glass Company to become Owens-Illinois, Inc.[5]
Until July 2007, the company was also a worldwide manufacturer of plastics packaging with operations in North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Plastics packaging products manufactured by O-I included containers, closures, and prescription containers. In July 2007 O-I completed the sale of its entire plastics packaging business to Rexam PLC, a UK listed packaging manufacturer.
O-I was a part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from June 1, 1959 until March 12, 1987. The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in January 2009. O-I was one of the original S&P 500 companies in 1957. It was removed in 1987 (after purchase by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts), added in 1991 and removed again in 2000.[6]
In October 2010, Owens-Illinois Venezuela C.A was expropriated by President Hugo Chávez.[7]
In May 2015, O-I made an offer to purchase the food and beverage glass container business of Mexican company Vitro for $2.15 billion.[8] Timing for finalization has not been announced.
Partnership with NEG[edit]
O-I partnered with NEG (Nippon Electric Glass), to produce glass television screens at its Columbus, Ohio and Pittston, Pennsylvania plants in the 1970s through the mid-1990s before allowing Techneglas to take over the operations.
Environmental Issues[edit]
Although it has not made an asbestos-containing materials since 1958, Owens-Illinois invented, tested, manufactured and distributed KAYLO asbestos containing thermal pipe insulation from 1948 through 1958.[9] Owens-Illinois remains a named defendant in numerous asbestos litigation matters throughout the U.S.[10] Some claims in these cases allege that Owens-Illinois was a participant in the seventh annual Saranac Seminar[11] when the cancer-causing potential of asbestos was studied in the 1950s.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
