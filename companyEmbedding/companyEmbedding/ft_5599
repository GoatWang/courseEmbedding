Spider-mediated flux of PCBs from contaminated sediments to terrestrial ecosystems and potential risks to arachnivorous birdsProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2010Author(s): Walters, D.M., M.A. Mills, K.M.

                    Port Charlotte, Florida is situated around one of my favorite places,  Charlotte Harbor, Florida's second-largest estuary system. The  unspoiled beauty and its livability, making it a destination of choice for both full-time residents and vacationers is what Port Charlotte/Charlotte County Florida is all about.

In spite of a growth explosion in recent years, Charlotte County has remained a delightful place to live, work and vacation.

The Greater Port Charlotte area has so much to offer from schooling, art, symphonies, fishing, golfing, boating, major league baseball spring training, and much, much more.   The area just provides a beautiful environment to live in.   There is something for everyone

One of the biggest plus of living in Florida is our unique wildlife.  If you love nature, which includes alligators, coyotes, foxes, panthers, bobcats, bears, great blue heron, dolphins (those beautiful creatures that they are), then look no further.  This is the place for you.
