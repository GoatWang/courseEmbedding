ORLANDO, Fla., Dec. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Florida Technical College President and CEO, David Ruggieri, believes that success is available to everyone who goes after it with a plan, determination and resilience.  Ruggieri, who has more than 40 years of experience in post-secondary education, is currently in a media tour exploring this very topic with U.S. audiences.
"Success requires discipline," Ruggieri recently told Ocala Magazine. "But first, we must identify what we like to do, what brings a sense of fulfillment, and how that fits into opportunities in the market. We have to establish short and a long term goals and set a plan to reach them. We need to accept that we will fall along the way. But I always tell my students, if you fall, don't fall backwards -fall forward. You'll be at least four feet ahead from where you fell. Success is a process. Those who seek immediate gratification will likely not get it."
In addition to Ocala Magazine, Ruggieri's advice to achieve success has been featured on the cover of Central Florida's La Nota Magazine, Central Florida Lifestyle Magazine, Insight Magazine and SpaceCoast Magazine. In South Florida, he has shared his insight with the readers of Mujer Magazine and Negocios Magazine.
Earlier this fall, Ruggieri's book, Soul of Success: Volume 1, hit bookstores' shelves and online book retailers. It quickly climbed to the first spots in several Amazon.com categories, including Direct Marketing and Marketing for Small Businesses. The book was co-written by famed author Jack Canfield, of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, in collaboration with group of carefully selected entrepreneurs, business and civic leaders who shared their insight on overcoming obstacles, planning the route to success and celebrating achievement by giving back.
Under Ruggieri's leadership, Florida Technical College has gone from three to six campuses and quadrupled its enrollment to almost 4,000 students.  He has reinvented his role as President and CEO to be more than an administrator.  Ruggieri sees his job as that of a mentor with the tremendous responsibility to help non-traditional and low-income students –many of them Hispanic and African American- walk across the graduation stage and get started on their careers.
"Part of my job is to make sure our students stay on track," Ruggieri said. "It is paramount that they have full support to finish what they started and leave Florida Technical College with a diploma.  Our students, for the most, are not the traditional type that goes to college right after high school. They are young adults in their mid-twenties and thirties, and even older. They have lives, family, jobs, and balancing all of that with college can be trying."
At FTC, Ruggieri is currently developing more programs in technical fields as well as in construction and construction management, business, IT and the medical field. Also in the works, programs taught in Spanish that would be complemented by English classes for mon-native speakers. 
Ruggieri is available for interviews and speaking engagements. Soul of Success: Volume 1 is widely available in U.S. bookstores an online in Amazon.com.
About Florida Technical College: FTC offers associate and bachelor's degrees and diploma programs in a range of professions, including healthcare, computer networking, graphic design, criminal justice, culinary arts and cosmetology.  FTC's campuses are located in Orlando, Lakeland, DeLand, Kissimmee, Pembroke Pines and Cutler Bay. Founded in 1982 to provide private, post-secondary education in specialized fields, FTC is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. Program availability varies by campus.

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Soul of Success, a book co-written by Florida Technical College President and CEO, David Ruggieri, reached best-seller status in several U.S. and Canada Amazon categories upon hitting the bookstands earlier this month. 
The book is a collaboration between author Jack Canfield, of the famed Chicken Soup for the Soul series, and a selected group of business leaders and entrepreneurs. It was released Sept. 10 by CelebrityPress, immediately reaching the number one spot in Amazon in the Direct Marketing and Marketing for Small Businesses categories. It also placed near the top in the Entrepreneurship, Marketing and Sales, and Business Management categories. 
Ruggieri is an education advocate and a community leader who has championed many social causes like the fight against hunger, homelessness and better access to education. He empowers individuals to become the best version possible of themselves, using education as a tool to achieve just that.
"To succeed today, it is useful, perhaps even essential, to have a good education," Ruggieri said. "Without education you are at the mercy of good luck to succeed. With education, you get opportunities to advance. Pay attention and learn to identify and take advantage of them." 
Ruggieri said he chose to participate in the writing of the book to share his personal path to success. He hopes that readers will learn something that helps them in their own journeys.
"We all want success," he said. "But success doesn't happen. Success is forged one step at a time. It is important to set short-term and long-term goals to help us gauge progress and evaluate the strategies we're employing. That has being key to my personal and professional growth. It is humbling and very rewarding to be able to share that with others."
Soul of Success is widely available in U.S. bookstores an online in Amazon.com.
