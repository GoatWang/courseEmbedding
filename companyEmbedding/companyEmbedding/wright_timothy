Timothy Wright is one of the last great gospel artist whose style of singing is pure from the "old school".
This cd is from his early years, and the choir is in their purest form. Most of his songs are lead by him. The beat is fast and in "having church" style. I think you will like this cd, almost all the songs are enjoyable. It is a keeper.

Best if the BestI enjoyed this CD with all the beautiful Gospel songs. There are 3 specific songs that I listen to over and over as they help built my spirit each time. pfThe music was Christian gospel just what is needed in these time. The wife still loves Elvis' music. The quality and price were good. NO ONE LIKE ELVISNO ONE SINGS GOSPEL LIKE ELVIS!
GREAT CD...HIGHLY RECOMMENDpf The music was Christian gospel just what is needed in these time. The quality and price were good. GospelAwesome collection of songs every one listening to gospel should have it.pfThe music was Christian gospel just what is needed in these time. The quality and price were good. The right choice for Spiritual NourishmentI love both of these gospel groups - I couldn't be happier.1970's gospelThis is a wonderful CD. It's full of all the great hits of Andrae's. It's kind of a flashback of the 1970's gospel music. That's when gospel music was wonderful! Lots of soul but you can understand the lyrics and they are easy to sing along with.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?BrandsPrecision SeriesClub CleanRSAAcrobatAmbicoHerbalAireHydro-IndustriesKnomoODLUniversalFormatsCompact DiscVinyl LPReleased12-FEB-1304-FEB-1306-MAY-0827-SEP-1108-NOV-1124-FEB-0903-JUL-1205-FEB-0812-JUL-1107-SEP-1001-FEB-1101-NOV-1120-APR-1004-OCT-1114-SEP-1017-NOV-0926-JAN-1002-NOV-1004-MAY-1005-OCT-1011-JAN-1111-OCT-1119-AUG-1419-OCT-1020-SEP-1131-MAR-0915-FEB-1116-MAR-1023-AUG-0523-AUG-1102-AUG-1104-JUN-1307-DEC-1008-MAR-1110-MAY-1112-MAR-1314-APR-0914-JUL-0915-NOV-1117-APR-0718-OCT-1121-OCT-0823-FEB-1025-SEP-0726-APR-1127-AUG-1331-AUG-1031-JAN-1203-APR-1205-APR-1106-JAN-0907-APR-0907-JUN-1107-OCT-0808-AUG-0612-FEB-0812-JUN-1214-NOV-9516-AUG-0517-JAN-1217-JUN-0819-SEP-0621-JUN-1121-SEP-1024-AUG-1024-JAN-1224-SEP-1326-JUL-1126-OCT-1028-SEP-1030-AUG-1130-MAY-0602-MAR-0404-JAN-1105-SEP-0606-OCT-0907-AUG-1209-NOV-1011-NOV-0813-MAR-0713-MAY-0816-AUG-1117-FEB-0917-JUL-0717-OCT-0618-MAR-0818-SEP-0719-APR-1120-DEC-1120-JAN-1520-MAY-0821-APR-0922-AUG-0622-MAY-1222-SEP-0925-AUG-0925-MAR-0827-DEC-1127-JUL-1027-MAY-14Sort by:Sort ByBest SellingPrice Low - HighPrice High - LowAvg.

Liturgical Press Suggests



Abbot Timothy Wright proposes sowing a small seed from which might grow a greater respect between the world's two largest religions, Christianity and Islam. Indeed, he believes that the seed has already been planted. Christians give unique value to their revealed Scriptures as the "Word of God."  Muslims speak of the Qur'an as God speaking to them.In No Peace without Prayer, Wright presents the case for developing this faith in the Word of God to establish groups of Christians and Muslims dedicated to sharing their respective "Divine Word" in ways that enhance the "other."  This is not a tussle for converts but a way into greater mutual understanding-under the eye of the God who communicates this Word-to create a new shared memory. Such is a work of prayer, a prayer that could lead to greater peace. The key word, says Wright, is partnership, arising from their shared belief in the One God, creator of the universe, communicating with the human world and merciful to the repentant.Abbot Timothy Wright, OSB, presently teaches at Benedictine University, Lisle, Illinois, and is the delegate of the Abbot Primate of the Benedictine Confederation for Monastic-Muslim Relations. He served as abbot of Ampleforth Abbey from 1997 to 2005, during which time he and Mohammad Ali Shomali organized a series of dialogues between Catholic monks and theologians and Shi'a Muslims from Iran.


"This is a delightful and comprehensive book written not only out of scholarly reflection and study but also very much from the vantage point of lived dialogical experience. It advocates Christian–Muslim dialogue and engages with a particular dialogical modality with authority and integrity, displaying intimate familiarity with the resources and possibilities that may be found in both Islam and Christianity, while it clearly, and appropriately, speaks specifically out of and into Christian engagement in this dialogue." Douglas Pratt, Islam and Christian‐Muslim Relations 
The book is clearly written and accessible. It can serve as a good introduction for beginners to the beliefs and spirituality of Muslims in comparison to those of Christians. It is also something of a "how to" book on interfaith dialogue, offering practical tips on how to start up a dialogue of spirituality, and even how to conduct such a series of encounters. Philip Timko, OSB, American Benedictine Review 
Recent popes have called upon Catholics to get to know, understand, and respect Islam. All this in order to be better Catholics and partners in the future. Abbot Timothy received a commission from the Abbot President of all Benedictines to bring together people who were already in dialogue and friendship. This book amplifies his journey and the providential spiritual and cultural baggage he brought with him. It is a fascinating trip. The book is based on his doctoral thesis about a new way of transcending the apparent chasm between those seeking God by contrasting paths. He proposes a community founded for a dialogue of spiritualties-Muslim and Christian. He kindly breaks his proposal out into thirty-six chapters, with clear titles, and thus the reader can pick and choose between the practical steps and the deeper contemplative traditions in each tradition. The challenges to a peaceful future in our world are obvious. Abbot Timothy has essayed an imaginative step forward, based on his own experience and extensive contacts with unobtrusive dialogue groups in both hemispheres.  Fr. Finbarr Dowling, OSB Pastor Marthasville, Missouri  
The strength of this book lies in the lived experience of the Author. His own experience of dialogue and deep prayer life informs his discussion on every page. This book reminds us of the importance of spiritual practices because as we deepen our experience of the love of God, we become increasingly open to listen to and be touched by those in other faith traditions who carry with them a similar experience of the love of God. The book provides a path to dialogue and inspires hope for a better relationship between Muslims and Christians that might become a foundation for building peace in the world.Patricia Sharbaugh, Catholic Books Review 
Abbot Timothy proposes sowing a small seed from which might grow a greater respect between the world's two largest religions, Christianity and Islam. Indeed, he believes that the seed has already been planted. Christians give unique value to their revealed Scriptures as the "Word of God." Muslims speak of the Qur'an as God speaking to them. In No Peace without Prayer, Wright presents the case for developing this faith in the Word of God to establish groups of Christians and Muslims dedicated to sharing their respective "Divine Word" in ways that enhance the "other." This is not a tussle for converts but a way into greater mutual understanding-under the eye of the God who communicates this Word-to create a new shared memory. Such is a work of prayer, a prayer that could lead to greater peace. The key word, says Wright, is partnership, arising from their shared belief in the One God, creator of the universe, communicating with the human world and merciful tthe repentant. William Skudlarek, Secretary General, Monastic Interreligious Dialogue  
[No Peace without Prayer] concludes with a summary of qualities helpful to persons preparing to enter Muslim-Christian dialogue and offers practical suggestions for organizing an interreligious prayer group. The range of issues covered by the author makes the book of interest not only to Benedictines but to all persons interested in promoting better relations between the adherents of two of the world's major religions. Ovey N. Mohammed, SJ, Regis College, Toronto School of Theology, Toronto, Ontario, Worship

Product Description▼▲
1&2 Timothy & TitusStudy Scripture with N.T. Wright! When you need to know how to do something, a manuel is the best place to start. 1&2 Timothy and Titus might be called "the Teacher's Manuel," because so much of what they contain is about the kind of teaching that Christian leaders should-and shouldn't-be giving. Just as Timothy and Titus needed help to lead their young churches well in the midst of powerful cultural forces, we need guidance for correct leading and living in our own context. These studies on Paul's letters point us in the right direction.About the N.T. Wright for Everyone Bible Study Guides SeriesThe guides in this series are designed to help you understand Scripture in fresh ways under the guidance of one of the world's leading New Testament scholars.

Publisher's Description▼▲
When you need to know how to do something, a manual is the best place to start. 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus might be called "the Teacher's Manual," because so much of what they contain is about the kind of teaching that Christian leaders should--and shouldn't--be giving. Just as Timothy and Titus needed help to lead their young churches well in the midst of powerful cultural forces, we need guidance for correct leading and living in our own context. These studies on Paul's letters point us in the right direction. This guide by Tom Wright can be used on its own or alongside his New Testament for Everyone commentary on 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus. It is designed to help you understand Scripture in fresh ways under the guidance of one of the world's leading New Testament scholars. Thoughtful questions, prayer suggestions, and useful background and cultural information all guide you or a group more deeply into God's Word. Discover how you can participate more fully in God's kingdom.
