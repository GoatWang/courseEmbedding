Personalized Wealth Management
Our Firm provides comprehensive fee-based wealth management services to business owners, corporate executives, professional athletes, and similarly affluent clients. We utilize a team approach in analyzing and planning our client’s investment portfolio, estate plan, cash flow, income taxes, and retirement. The firm is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We require our advisors to be CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ licensees, ensuring that our clients receive knowledgeable, unbiased advice. TMD also recognizes the need for individual recommendations based solely on specific needs, circumstances, and goals; our clients count on us to stay on top of the ever-changing ‘face’ and unknowns of the market, its politics, and its people.  





About TMD





Our Core Belief OUR CORE BELIEF is to provide our clients with the highest level of service and technical expertise in the management and preservation of wealth. The entire staff of TMD & Associates is firmly committed to this philosophy so that we can make a difference in our client's lives.

Our Objective OUR OBJECTIVE is to provide our clients with the financial "peace of mind" that they need to fully enjoy their lives. We will do this by using the financial planning process as a means to help them organize, prioritize, and realize their financial goals and dreams. Our purpose is to help build, manage and preserve your wealth. We put our client's interest first, act with integrity and honesty, and strive for excellence in every facet of our practice. Our success is not measured by performance statistics but rather by our clients' success in achieving their goals.
Learn more 



Your Goals, Our Solutions OUR CLIENTS share in the realization that by coordinating and managing today's financial decisions, they can achieve their goals for tomorrow. They are individuals and businesses who expect excellence and have made a firm commitment to achieving it themselves. Our clients usually have no desire to manage their financial affairs on a daily basis, want to simplify their lives, and are willing to enter into a long-term relationship that is mutually beneficial. They are highly motivated to work with a professional advisor, not a sales representative.
Learn more 



Partnering with Others for a Better Result Our firm recognizes that our clients' needs are best served by a teamwork approach, so we partner with other professionals whose deep knowledge spans across a great range of specialties. This way, our clients are kept informed without having to manage the daily workflow of wealth management. For those clients who already have trusted relationships with other advisors, we will work with both you and your advisors to assure that we develop a coordinated plan that meets your personal needs.

Our Investment Approach




































Saturday, 22 July 2017

TDA LoginJoin MeetingDocument VaultFAQADVPrivacy






































































Our Investment Approach

Investing is only one component of wealth management, though certainly an important one. We believe that a combination of active and passive management can add value over time, especially within the context of our ever-changing world.  We allocate assets among the major classes of cash, stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments.  We strongly believe that non-traditional assets such as private equity, private real estate, private lending, and other investment strategies can add material value to a client's portfolio through diversification and risk-adjusted returns. We access research and information from a variety of independent sources that are typically paid strictly on a fee-for-service basis in order to protect the integrity of the information that we rely upon for portfolio decision-making.   We focus on the details but not at the expense of the bigger picture—our client's personal goals.
TMD partners with firms that provide us with institutional-level knowledge to help in the process of managing our client's wealth.  We focus on 3 key areas when designing a personalized portfolio: 
 
Risk Profiling
TMD has created six unique models for use in portfolio allocation. These client-centric, risk-targeted models serve as the underlying basis for virtually all asset allocation decisions. TMD's six models are designed to align individual investor risk tolerance with appropriate capital market exposure.  Our goal is to manage the unfortunate mismatch that so often occurs between investor expectations and future market return potential. The models are monitored on a regular basis and adjusted according to perceived market valuation, implied volatility, and future return expectations. 
 
Asset Allocation Universe
TMD seeks to identify optimal risk adjusted return opportunities between and among the major asset classes:

Domestic Equity: Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, Multi-Strategy
International Equity: Developed Market, Emerging Market
Alternative: Commodity, Real Estate, Specialty/Other
Fixed Income: Diversified Fixed, High Yield, Inflation Protected, US Government, Global
Cash

 
Asset Manager Selection
Good money managers need to be able to allocate capital through a variety of market conditions.  Superior investment managers generally distinguish themselves along the following five factors: philosophy of risk control, process of decision making, cultural orientation, ownership structure & rewards system, and excellence of personnel.  As stewards of our client's hard-earned money, risk control is the most important factor in the hiring of a manager.  Diversification among investment styles, strategies, and asset classes is also part of the manager selection process.
 
A big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the what-ifs of life.
-Suze Orman

Our Advisory Process

We believe in the financial planning process. This is the process of identifying goals, gathering and reviewing financial data, and designing and implementing a plan to help you reach your goals. It is a lifelong process. Once the plan is in place, it needs to be monitored, reviewed and updated to meet dynamic circumstances.

Phase 4 - Manage


Understand

How do you define success?
We will work with you to fully understand where you are now and clarify where you want to go.
What is important to you? What keeps you up at night? How we can help?Design

Our next step is to construct a written financial blueprint:
The Financial Plan

Creates spending priorities
Evaluates risks versus rewards
Connects your income and expenses with your investments
Evolves with you

The Investment Policy Statement

Risk Profiling as a core tenant

Volatility parameters based on current market conditions

Implement

We then implement solutions to meet your wealth management needs:

Why TMD?

Our Objective is to help build, manage, and preserve our clients’ wealth, allowing them the financial peace of mind to fully enjoy their lives. We think of the financial planning process as the frame of our client’s financial house – a solid structure that will help them organize, prioritize, and realize their financial goals and dreams. Building with integrity is foundational to any progress, so we strive for honesty and excellence in every facet of our practice; attention to the small details means success in the big picture. Our clients’ progress in achieving their goals, rather than quarterly performance statistics, is our benchmark for success.
Our Clients share in the realization that by coordinating and managing today’s financial decisions, they can achieve tomorrow’s goals. They are individuals and businesses who expect excellence and have made a firm commitment to achieving it themselves. Our clients usually prefer to simplify their lives by outsourcing the management of their financial affairs, and are willing to enter into a long-term relationship that is mutually beneficial. They are highly motivated to work with a professional advisor, not a sales representative.

Personalized Wealth Management
Our Firm provides comprehensive fee-based wealth management services to business owners, corporate executives, professional athletes, and similarly affluent clients. We utilize a team approach in analyzing and planning our client’s investment portfolio, estate plan, cash flow, income taxes, and retirement. The firm is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We require our advisors to be CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ licensees, ensuring that our clients receive knowledgeable, unbiased advice. TMD also recognizes the need for individual recommendations based solely on specific needs, circumstances, and goals; our clients count on us to stay on top of the ever-changing ‘face’ and unknowns of the market, its politics, and its people.  





About TMD





Our Core Belief OUR CORE BELIEF is to provide our clients with the highest level of service and technical expertise in the management and preservation of wealth. The entire staff of TMD & Associates is firmly committed to this philosophy so that we can make a difference in our client's lives.
Learn more 



Our Objective OUR OBJECTIVE is to provide our clients with the financial "peace of mind" that they need to fully enjoy their lives. We will do this by using the financial planning process as a means to help them organize, prioritize, and realize their financial goals and dreams. Our purpose is to help build, manage and preserve your wealth. We put our client's interest first, act with integrity and honesty, and strive for excellence in every facet of our practice. Our success is not measured by performance statistics but rather by our clients' success in achieving their goals.
Learn more 



Your Goals, Our Solutions OUR CLIENTS share in the realization that by coordinating and managing today's financial decisions, they can achieve their goals for tomorrow. They are individuals and businesses who expect excellence and have made a firm commitment to achieving it themselves. Our clients usually have no desire to manage their financial affairs on a daily basis, want to simplify their lives, and are willing to enter into a long-term relationship that is mutually beneficial. They are highly motivated to work with a professional advisor, not a sales representative.
Learn more 



Partnering with Others for a Better Result Our firm recognizes that our clients' needs are best served by a teamwork approach, so we partner with other professionals whose deep knowledge spans across a great range of specialties. This way, our clients are kept informed without having to manage the daily workflow of wealth management. For those clients who already have trusted relationships with other advisors, we will work with both you and your advisors to assure that we develop a coordinated plan that meets your personal needs.
