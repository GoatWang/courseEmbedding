      'Extinction' review: Zombies on ice 'Extinction' review: Zombies on ice   BY  Katherine Pushkar   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, July 29, 2015, 2:22 PM     facebook   Tweet   email          Matthew Fox in "Extinction"       BY  Katherine Pushkar   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, July 29, 2015, 2:22 PM     Title "Extinction"          Film Info: With Matthew Fox, Jeffrey Donovan. Toughing it out in the tundra with frozen zombies. Director: Miguel Ángel Vivas (1:43) R: Violence, terror, language. On demand.     
	If you’re ever stuck in a postapocalyptic ice age, try not to live next door to the one guy you hate more than anyone else.

	Jack (Jeffrey Donovan) and Patrick (Matthew Fox) really do not like each other. Jack’s a wholesome dad raising his daughter, Lu (Quinn McColgan), and eating canned beans and rice. Patrick lives like a wild man with his dog and eats horse steak.

	Something happened between them, back when they were fleeing zombies, and it has to do with Lu’s dead mother. Now they don’t speak, the zombies are gone, and it’s been a long nine years.

	How much do these two hate each other? When crack shot Jack has the chance to save Patrick from a zombie attack, he doesn’t. The movie spends nearly an hour — too long — establishing the bad blood.

	As it happens, Patrick lives. The zombies have evolved. They can now survive cold, but they no longer infect people via flesh wounds. Also, they’re blind. These are only problems if you’re a zombie purist. At least they still want to tear people apart, and they remain plenty scary.

	If only they had more screen time. The film’s core problems: too little zombie and too much plot. The upside, though, is McColgan as Lu. Chafing against her small world, McColgan is cute, charming and clearly someone to watch.

With a relatively small cast, the story (and back story) kept my interest throughout. Beginning as a typical zombie movie, the film then takes us off into a frozen post-apocalyptic world where the focus of the story is the relationship between the three central characters, before throwing in a host of evolved zombies. Not necessarily for your typical Z-head, fans of a good story should give it a try.If expectations you have zero, then give this film a shot; you'll find no handheld camera shakes, just good old fashioned plot. When your expectations are zero, they are easily exceeded: in a world stood drenched in B-movie zeds, Extinction is sorely needed.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starstwo best friends who have become bitterly estranged after a virus ...ByGratuitousVioletsTOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon 17 April 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseA rare gem; a story driven zombie apocalypse movie!  Matthew Fox and Jeffrey Donovan star as Patrick and Jack, two best friends who have become bitterly estranged after a virus devastates the planet.  Jack (Donovan) lives with his young daughter, Lu, in a large farmhouse adjacent to Patrick's land.  As far as any of these three know, they are the last people on earth, and live lonely lives with limited resources in a snowy desolate place.  Jack would rather wait out the rest of his existence safe and comfortable, keeping up with the façade of being a happy normal family, locked in his home with Lu, under the assumption that the "monsters" (zombies) have long since perished.  Meanwhile Patrick has become a hardened survivalist, a stoic realist who is bitter with regrets and is desperate to build the bridges that were burned many years before so that they all might have a chance to survive and escape the snowy plains where they live. Lastly,  Lu is caught between both men, battling confusion and isolation growing up as the only child in an empty world and feeling a sense of loneliness for the mother who died when she was an infant, she feels rebellious to her father, who only wants to keep her safe, and feels a strange lull towards Patrick that she can't explain.Told through occasional flashbacks and mostly dialogue driven, this is a film with very less action and more drama, about trying to survive on a very human level when things have gone awry, trying to maintain normality when there is no "normal" in the world any more.  The story focuses quite a bit on isolation on various different levels relating to each character, all which are quite relatable and keep you locked into the story.I feel almost if this hadn't had very different looking zombies (reminding me more of the Wendigo type monsters in the game "Until Dawn" or the movie "Devils Pass") this could have felt like a stand alone feature episode relating to "The Walking Dead" in tone and writing.  It was very well written with a few small twists and features some very strong acting despite that 95% of the film only features 3 actors.It's a rare gem, as I said, and if you're only looking for gore and blood flying, guns and knives, this isn't the one for you.  This is "people" story, not a monster story.  Really worth a watch in my opinion.Read more0Comment|

Product Description
For nine years, Patrick (Matthew Fox), Jack (Jeffrey Donovan) and his daughter Lu (Quinn McColgan) have outlasted the zombie apocalypse by shutting themselves off in the snowbound town of Harmony. The monsters have seemingly disappeared, with no sign of other survivors, but the constant fear of the unknown is starting to take a toll on this makeshift family. When Patrick goes scavenging for food, he discovers the undead have returned and evolved into something terrifying, beyond imagination. Will the last breath of the human race survive a second zombie apocalypse?

With a relatively small cast, the story (and back story) kept my interest throughout. Beginning as a typical zombie movie, the film then takes us off into a frozen post-apocalyptic world where the focus of the story is the relationship between the three central characters, before throwing in a host of evolved zombies. Not necessarily for your typical Z-head, fans of a good story should give it a try.If expectations you have zero, then give this film a shot; you'll find no handheld camera shakes, just good old fashioned plot. When your expectations are zero, they are easily exceeded: in a world stood drenched in B-movie zeds, Extinction is sorely needed.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starstwo best friends who have become bitterly estranged after a virus ...ByGratuitousVioletsTOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICEon 17 April 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseA rare gem; a story driven zombie apocalypse movie!  Matthew Fox and Jeffrey Donovan star as Patrick and Jack, two best friends who have become bitterly estranged after a virus devastates the planet.  Jack (Donovan) lives with his young daughter, Lu, in a large farmhouse adjacent to Patrick's land.  As far as any of these three know, they are the last people on earth, and live lonely lives with limited resources in a snowy desolate place.  Jack would rather wait out the rest of his existence safe and comfortable, keeping up with the façade of being a happy normal family, locked in his home with Lu, under the assumption that the "monsters" (zombies) have long since perished.  Meanwhile Patrick has become a hardened survivalist, a stoic realist who is bitter with regrets and is desperate to build the bridges that were burned many years before so that they all might have a chance to survive and escape the snowy plains where they live. Lastly,  Lu is caught between both men, battling confusion and isolation growing up as the only child in an empty world and feeling a sense of loneliness for the mother who died when she was an infant, she feels rebellious to her father, who only wants to keep her safe, and feels a strange lull towards Patrick that she can't explain.Told through occasional flashbacks and mostly dialogue driven, this is a film with very less action and more drama, about trying to survive on a very human level when things have gone awry, trying to maintain normality when there is no "normal" in the world any more.  The story focuses quite a bit on isolation on various different levels relating to each character, all which are quite relatable and keep you locked into the story.I feel almost if this hadn't had very different looking zombies (reminding me more of the Wendigo type monsters in the game "Until Dawn" or the movie "Devils Pass") this could have felt like a stand alone feature episode relating to "The Walking Dead" in tone and writing.  It was very well written with a few small twists and features some very strong acting despite that 95% of the film only features 3 actors.It's a rare gem, as I said, and if you're only looking for gore and blood flying, guns and knives, this isn't the one for you.  This is "people" story, not a monster story.  Really worth a watch in my opinion.Read more0Comment|
