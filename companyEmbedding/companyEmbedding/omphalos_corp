Choosing the right maintenance service for SMT line 
With deployment cost of a surface mount technology (SMT) machine ranging between$50,000 and $300,000, it is imperative that proper care should be taken for their timely maintenance and repairs to avoid failures. The cause of failures can be grouped into four major categories—man, machine, method and materials. Man as a failure source can occur from lack of training or experience, human error or poor supervision. Machine as a failure source can occur from poor maintenance, equipment used beyond its design criteria or machinery that is old or outdated. Methods as a failure source can occur from lack of supervision. It is therefore essential to avail the right maintenance service to avoid such failures.
 
An SMT machine is meant to operates continuously for 24×7 with accuracy in placement and with minimal breakdowns. With this kind of performance requirement, its maintenance is very essential. Manufacturers of SMT machines give guidelines for their daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly maintenance and adhering to these guidelines enhances their performance, working life and the quality of end products.

Technical problems
Common technical problems occurring in SMT machines are print shift, component drop, rejection, soldering problems like dry solder, bridging, problems pertaining to software and vacuum path, failure of control circuits and power supply. As Meghnad Sudhirchandra Shah, managing director, Frontline Electronics, puts it, "Feeders require regular maintenance. Calibration of machines, which can be done only by trained service technicians of the distributor, is also very important.
 
According to Gurjal, shift in accuracy in case of printers and placement machines and changes in temperatures in case of reflows are some other technical problems faced by EMS companies. These can be caused due to design and manufacturing defects or simply due to wear and tear. Erratic power conditions also cause problems in these machines.

					Full Description



Omphalos, Corp., incorporated on April 15, 2008, through its subsidiaries, which serve as third-party resellers, supplies a range of equipment and parts, including refurbished and modified reflow soldering ovens and automated optical inspection (AOI) machines for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers in Taiwan and China. The Company also provides after sale services, such as maintenance and repairs to its customers and sells parts for the equipment. The Company offers a range of products, including Tamura N2 Reflow Ovens and Gryphon Laser Marking System. The Company's Tamura N2 Reflow Oven has multiple temperature-controlled heat emitting infrared radiation compartments that create a phase change in flux (Small Soldier Particles) turning the solid into a liquid. When cooled in the final compartment, the flux undergoes another phase change turning from a liquid back into a solid forming a bond between the surface mount component and etched circuit board. The Tamura Line takes the additional step of being an oxygen-free environment instead it utilizes nitrogen gas to minimize oxidation.The Company's Gryphon Laser Marking System is placed at the beginning of the surface-mount technology (SMT) production line where it Laser Etches a two-dimensional (2D) Barcode onto the surface of a printed circuit board. 2D barcodes allow for more data to be physically written to the circuit board, usually the threshold is when over 20 characters need to be written, 2D barcoding is required. The 2D barcode helps to simplify management information system (MIS) by making more information available offline, such as an identification number, time of fabrication, plant of fabrication, making it easier to track defects and finished products to their final destination.The Company competes with Sayaka, Tamura Furukawa, Ishikawa, Daichi International, Panasonic, Hitachi and Sony Corporation.
