NYSE:PG 







  "These changes demonstrate the depth and strength of P&G’s leadership        bench" 



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) today announced that Dimitri 
      Panayotopoulos, Vice Chairman and Advisor to the Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer, will retire from the Company, effective January 2, 
      2014, after 37 years of service.
    

      Mr. Panayotopoulos joined P&G in 1977. He served in sales and general 
      management roles spanning Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, 
      eventually overseeing all P&G brands as Vice Chair – Global Business 
      Units. As previously announced, he was elected to his current role as 
      advisor to the CEO effective July 1, 2013.
    

      “We appreciate Dimitri’s considerable contributions over his long and 
      successful career, building leading positions for the Company in Egypt 
      and then the Middle East, China, Central and Eastern Europe, and 
      Africa,” said A.G. Lafley, P&G Chairman of the Board, President and 
      Chief Executive Officer. “He concluded his distinguished career by 
      leading our global business units through challenging times.”
    

      P&G also announced that Bruce Brown, Chief Technology Officer, 
      will retire on August 31, 2014, after more than 34 years of service. 
      Until that time, effective February 1, 2014, Mr. Brown has been named 
      Officer on Special Assignment. Kathleen B. Fish, currently Vice 
      President–Research & Development, Global Fabric Care, has been elected 
      Chief Technology Officer, succeeding Mr. Brown, effective February 1, 
      2014. Ms. Fish will report to A.G. Lafley.
    

      Robert L. Fregolle, Jr., Global Customer Business Development Officer, 
      will retire on June 30, 2014, after more than 36 years of service. Until 
      that time, effective February 1, 2014, Mr. Fregolle has been named 
      Officer on Special Assignment. Carolyn M. Tastad, currently Vice 
      President–Global Market Strategy & Planning and One Go-to-Market 
      Optimization, has been elected Global Customer Business Development 
      Officer, succeeding Mr. Fregolle, effective February 1, 2014. Ms. Tastad 
      will report to Werner Geissler, Vice Chairman–Global Operations, and Mr. 
      Lafley.
    

      “These changes demonstrate the depth and strength of P&G’s leadership 
      bench,” said Mr. Lafley. “Dimitri, Bruce and Bob have each served P&G 
      for more than 34 years and have made a lasting, positive impact on the 
      Company. Kathy and Carolyn are experienced P&G leaders who will continue 
      to strengthen our innovation and go-to-market capabilities going 
      forward.”
    

      Mr. Brown began his P&G career in 1980, and served in Research & 
      Development roles his entire career, culminating in his election to the 
      position of Chief Technology Officer in 2008. At P&G, the Chief 
      Technology Officer is responsible for the Company’s innovation 
      capabilities and global R&D organization. During his nearly six years in 
      this role, Mr. Brown has launched several important innovations and 
      established the key technology platforms that will drive P&G’s 
      innovation programs in the future.
    

      Ms. Fish joined P&G in 1979 and has led R&D teams in most of P&G’s 
      leading core categories over her 34-year career, including Baby Care, 
      Hair Care and Fabric Care. Most recently, she led the R&D team behind 
      the launch of Tide Pods and Downy Unstopables.
    

      Mr. Fregolle joined P&G in 1979. He spent the majority of his P&G sales 
      career outside of the U.S., in leadership roles across Central and 
      Eastern Europe and Asia, before returning to the U.S. to lead P&G’s 
      Global Customer Business Development organization in 2009. During his 
      36-year career, he strengthened customer relationships across developed 
      and developing markets and significantly increased the reach of P&G’s 
      distribution around the world.
    

      Ms. Tastad began her P&G career in 1983. She has deep experience leading 
      sales and market development organizations for P&G businesses in the 
      U.S., Canada, Europe and globally, and has worked in a range of 
      businesses including deep experience in Health and Beauty.
    

      In addition, P&G announced that Kirk Perry, currently President–Global 
      Family Care, will leave P&G effective December 2, 2013, to pursue other 
      interests. Steven D. Bishop, currently Group President–Global Feminine 
      Care, will be named Group President–Global Feminine and Family Care. Mr. 
      Bishop will continue to report to Martin Riant, Group President–Global 
      Baby, Feminine and Family Care.
