Dentsply Sirona is an American dental equipment maker and dental consumables producer that markets its products in over 120 countries (factories in 21 countries). It is a leader in consumable dental products.[1]
As an equipment maker it designs and manufactures laboratory and specialty products relating to dental supplies. With regards to consumable products it specializes in anesthetics, plaque and gum disease prevention (prophylaxis) and tooth polishers; It also designs and constructs artificial teeth.[2] Because of the income disparity between wealthy and developing nations the variety of products in demand differs from region to region (and thus subsidiary to subsidiary since many of them are regional). In 2010 the most important markets for sales were Europe & CIS (40%), USA (37%), Latin America (5%), Asia (excl CIS and Japan, 5%), Canada (4%), Japan (4%), Middle East & Africa (3%) and Australia (2%).[3] The largest market that Dentsply holds a leading market share in is the dental restorative sector ($4.0 billion according to the company).[4][5]
Markets outside the United States are becoming increasingly important: they accounted for 67% of Dentsply revenue in 2013 steady with 2012 but up from 66% and 63% the previous two years.[6][7] For 2012 acquisitions contributed all of the growth in sales (16.2%, currency effects were -3.8%). 2012 sales growth by region: Europe 27.5% (vs 17.9% in 2011), USA 13.8% (vs 4.9%), elsewhere 15.9% (vs 9.4%).[7] 88% of net sales were in dental products, 12% from consumable medical device products (casting industry).
On February 29, 2016 Dentsply combined with Long Island-based Sirona Dental Systems in a $14.5 billion merger of equals. While both supply dental products, Sirona's business centers on dental equipment in contrast with Dentsply's consumables.

History[edit]
The company which made use of the Dentsply name goes back to an artificial teeth and dental consumable products manufacturer and distributor founded by 4 New York businessmen in 1899.[8] However, the present company is largely the result of a merger in 1993 in which Gendex Corporation acquired Dentsply International Inc. for $590 million.[9] Gendex's dental x-ray equipment business which complemented Dentsply's was founded in 1983.
Dentsply was originally incorporated in 1899 as Dentists' Supply Company about the same time it made its first acquisition, a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the 4 founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist. Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage. Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting dentures, tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.
In the early 1920s the company selected European distributor E.de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also. A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time Ash company nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited. In 1925 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.[10]
High American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad especially in Europe and Australia led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad. Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing. In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.[2]
Key acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976.
In 1993 after it acquired Gendex Corp in a reverse takeover it went public on the Nasdaq. The new company then purchased medical x-ray tubes supplier Eureka X-Ray Inc. which was key since Gendex was a major manufacturer of x-ray systems (Eureka X-Ray was later sold in 1994).[11] Healthco its main distributor in the US went bankrupt in 1993.[12]
In June 2011 Dentsply acquired Astra Tech, the world's third largest maker of dental implants from the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for $1.8 billion. The deal raises revenue by 25% ($535M) and was completed on August 31, 2011.[13][14]
Acquisitions in 2011 caused the value of long term debt to increase by 147% while total assets grew by 146% (current assets however decreased in value).[15] Acquisition/restructuring charges were one of the reasons net income decreased 7.4%.
Divisions[edit]
Many divisions are regional in terms of their base and the market they serve (Most in Asia are named after the country they serve) while others are focused on a specific product (e.g. Maillefer in endodontics). The divisions and subsidiaries sell their products through regionally focused distribution companies as well as dentists and dental schools.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Dentsply Sirona is an American dental equipment maker and dental consumables producer that markets its products in over 120 countries (factories in 21 countries). It is a leader in consumable dental products.[1]
As an equipment maker it designs and manufactures laboratory and specialty products relating to dental supplies. With regards to consumable products it specializes in anesthetics, plaque and gum disease prevention (prophylaxis) and tooth polishers; It also designs and constructs artificial teeth.[2] Because of the income disparity between wealthy and developing nations the variety of products in demand differs from region to region (and thus subsidiary to subsidiary since many of them are regional). In 2010 the most important markets for sales were Europe & CIS (40%), USA (37%), Latin America (5%), Asia (excl CIS and Japan, 5%), Canada (4%), Japan (4%), Middle East & Africa (3%) and Australia (2%).[3] The largest market that Dentsply holds a leading market share in is the dental restorative sector ($4.0 billion according to the company).[4][5]
Markets outside the United States are becoming increasingly important: they accounted for 67% of Dentsply revenue in 2013 steady with 2012 but up from 66% and 63% the previous two years.[6][7] For 2012 acquisitions contributed all of the growth in sales (16.2%, currency effects were -3.8%). 2012 sales growth by region: Europe 27.5% (vs 17.9% in 2011), USA 13.8% (vs 4.9%), elsewhere 15.9% (vs 9.4%).[7] 88% of net sales were in dental products, 12% from consumable medical device products (casting industry).
On February 29, 2016 Dentsply combined with Long Island-based Sirona Dental Systems in a $14.5 billion merger of equals. While both supply dental products, Sirona's business centers on dental equipment in contrast with Dentsply's consumables.

History[edit]
The company which made use of the Dentsply name goes back to an artificial teeth and dental consumable products manufacturer and distributor founded by 4 New York businessmen in 1899.[8] However, the present company is largely the result of a merger in 1993 in which Gendex Corporation acquired Dentsply International Inc. for $590 million.[9] Gendex's dental x-ray equipment business which complemented Dentsply's was founded in 1983.
Dentsply was originally incorporated in 1899 as Dentists' Supply Company about the same time it made its first acquisition, a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the 4 founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist. Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage. Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting dentures, tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.
In the early 1920s the company selected European distributor E.de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also. A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time Ash company nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited. In 1925 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.[10]
High American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad especially in Europe and Australia led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad. Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing. In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.[2]
Key acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976.
In 1993 after it acquired Gendex Corp in a reverse takeover it went public on the Nasdaq. The new company then purchased medical x-ray tubes supplier Eureka X-Ray Inc. which was key since Gendex was a major manufacturer of x-ray systems (Eureka X-Ray was later sold in 1994).[11] Healthco its main distributor in the US went bankrupt in 1993.[12]
In June 2011 Dentsply acquired Astra Tech, the world's third largest maker of dental implants from the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for $1.8 billion. The deal raises revenue by 25% ($535M) and was completed on August 31, 2011.[13][14]
Acquisitions in 2011 caused the value of long term debt to increase by 147% while total assets grew by 146% (current assets however decreased in value).[15] Acquisition/restructuring charges were one of the reasons net income decreased 7.4%.
Divisions[edit]
Many divisions are regional in terms of their base and the market they serve (Most in Asia are named after the country they serve) while others are focused on a specific product (e.g. Maillefer in endodontics). The divisions and subsidiaries sell their products through regionally focused distribution companies as well as dentists and dental schools.

Dentsply Sirona is an American dental equipment maker and dental consumables producer that markets its products in over 120 countries (factories in 21 countries). It is a leader in consumable dental products.[1]
As an equipment maker it designs and manufactures laboratory and specialty products relating to dental supplies. With regards to consumable products it specializes in anesthetics, plaque and gum disease prevention (prophylaxis) and tooth polishers; It also designs and constructs artificial teeth.[2] Because of the income disparity between wealthy and developing nations the variety of products in demand differs from region to region (and thus subsidiary to subsidiary since many of them are regional). In 2010 the most important markets for sales were Europe & CIS (40%), USA (37%), Latin America (5%), Asia (excl CIS and Japan, 5%), Canada (4%), Japan (4%), Middle East & Africa (3%) and Australia (2%).[3] The largest market that Dentsply holds a leading market share in is the dental restorative sector ($4.0 billion according to the company).[4][5]
Markets outside the United States are becoming increasingly important: they accounted for 67% of Dentsply revenue in 2013 steady with 2012 but up from 66% and 63% the previous two years.[6][7] For 2012 acquisitions contributed all of the growth in sales (16.2%, currency effects were -3.8%). 2012 sales growth by region: Europe 27.5% (vs 17.9% in 2011), USA 13.8% (vs 4.9%), elsewhere 15.9% (vs 9.4%).[7] 88% of net sales were in dental products, 12% from consumable medical device products (casting industry).
On February 29, 2016 Dentsply combined with Long Island-based Sirona Dental Systems in a $14.5 billion merger of equals. While both supply dental products, Sirona's business centers on dental equipment in contrast with Dentsply's consumables.

History[edit]
The company which made use of the Dentsply name goes back to an artificial teeth and dental consumable products manufacturer and distributor founded by 4 New York businessmen in 1899.[8] However, the present company is largely the result of a merger in 1993 in which Gendex Corporation acquired Dentsply International Inc. for $590 million.[9] Gendex's dental x-ray equipment business which complemented Dentsply's was founded in 1983.
Dentsply was originally incorporated in 1899 as Dentists' Supply Company about the same time it made its first acquisition, a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the 4 founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist. Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage. Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting dentures, tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.
In the early 1920s the company selected European distributor E.de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also. A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time Ash company nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited. In 1925 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.[10]
High American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad especially in Europe and Australia led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad. Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing. In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.[2]
Key acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976.
In 1993 after it acquired Gendex Corp in a reverse takeover it went public on the Nasdaq. The new company then purchased medical x-ray tubes supplier Eureka X-Ray Inc. which was key since Gendex was a major manufacturer of x-ray systems (Eureka X-Ray was later sold in 1994).[11] Healthco its main distributor in the US went bankrupt in 1993.[12]
In June 2011 Dentsply acquired Astra Tech, the world's third largest maker of dental implants from the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for $1.8 billion. The deal raises revenue by 25% ($535M) and was completed on August 31, 2011.[13][14]
Acquisitions in 2011 caused the value of long term debt to increase by 147% while total assets grew by 146% (current assets however decreased in value).[15] Acquisition/restructuring charges were one of the reasons net income decreased 7.4%.
Divisions[edit]
Many divisions are regional in terms of their base and the market they serve (Most in Asia are named after the country they serve) while others are focused on a specific product (e.g. Maillefer in endodontics). The divisions and subsidiaries sell their products through regionally focused distribution companies as well as dentists and dental schools.

Dentsply Sirona is an American dental equipment maker and dental consumables producer that markets its products in over 120 countries (factories in 21 countries). It is a leader in consumable dental products.[1]
As an equipment maker it designs and manufactures laboratory and specialty products relating to dental supplies. With regards to consumable products it specializes in anesthetics, plaque and gum disease prevention (prophylaxis) and tooth polishers; It also designs and constructs artificial teeth.[2] Because of the income disparity between wealthy and developing nations the variety of products in demand differs from region to region (and thus subsidiary to subsidiary since many of them are regional). In 2010 the most important markets for sales were Europe & CIS (40%), USA (37%), Latin America (5%), Asia (excl CIS and Japan, 5%), Canada (4%), Japan (4%), Middle East & Africa (3%) and Australia (2%).[3] The largest market that Dentsply holds a leading market share in is the dental restorative sector ($4.0 billion according to the company).[4][5]
Markets outside the United States are becoming increasingly important: they accounted for 67% of Dentsply revenue in 2013 steady with 2012 but up from 66% and 63% the previous two years.[6][7] For 2012 acquisitions contributed all of the growth in sales (16.2%, currency effects were -3.8%). 2012 sales growth by region: Europe 27.5% (vs 17.9% in 2011), USA 13.8% (vs 4.9%), elsewhere 15.9% (vs 9.4%).[7] 88% of net sales were in dental products, 12% from consumable medical device products (casting industry).
On February 29, 2016 Dentsply combined with Long Island-based Sirona Dental Systems in a $14.5 billion merger of equals. While both supply dental products, Sirona's business centers on dental equipment in contrast with Dentsply's consumables.

History[edit]
The company which made use of the Dentsply name goes back to an artificial teeth and dental consumable products manufacturer and distributor founded by 4 New York businessmen in 1899.[8] However, the present company is largely the result of a merger in 1993 in which Gendex Corporation acquired Dentsply International Inc. for $590 million.[9] Gendex's dental x-ray equipment business which complemented Dentsply's was founded in 1983.
Dentsply was originally incorporated in 1899 as Dentists' Supply Company about the same time it made its first acquisition, a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the 4 founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist. Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage. Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting dentures, tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.
In the early 1920s the company selected European distributor E.de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also. A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time Ash company nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited. In 1925 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.[10]
High American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad especially in Europe and Australia led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad. Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing. In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.[2]
Key acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976.
In 1993 after it acquired Gendex Corp in a reverse takeover it went public on the Nasdaq. The new company then purchased medical x-ray tubes supplier Eureka X-Ray Inc. which was key since Gendex was a major manufacturer of x-ray systems (Eureka X-Ray was later sold in 1994).[11] Healthco its main distributor in the US went bankrupt in 1993.[12]
In June 2011 Dentsply acquired Astra Tech, the world's third largest maker of dental implants from the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for $1.8 billion. The deal raises revenue by 25% ($535M) and was completed on August 31, 2011.[13][14]
Acquisitions in 2011 caused the value of long term debt to increase by 147% while total assets grew by 146% (current assets however decreased in value).[15] Acquisition/restructuring charges were one of the reasons net income decreased 7.4%.
Divisions[edit]
Many divisions are regional in terms of their base and the market they serve (Most in Asia are named after the country they serve) while others are focused on a specific product (e.g. Maillefer in endodontics). The divisions and subsidiaries sell their products through regionally focused distribution companies as well as dentists and dental schools.

Dentsply Sirona is an American dental equipment maker and dental consumables producer that markets its products in over 120 countries (factories in 21 countries). It is a leader in consumable dental products.[1]
As an equipment maker it designs and manufactures laboratory and specialty products relating to dental supplies. With regards to consumable products it specializes in anesthetics, plaque and gum disease prevention (prophylaxis) and tooth polishers; It also designs and constructs artificial teeth.[2] Because of the income disparity between wealthy and developing nations the variety of products in demand differs from region to region (and thus subsidiary to subsidiary since many of them are regional). In 2010 the most important markets for sales were Europe & CIS (40%), USA (37%), Latin America (5%), Asia (excl CIS and Japan, 5%), Canada (4%), Japan (4%), Middle East & Africa (3%) and Australia (2%).[3] The largest market that Dentsply holds a leading market share in is the dental restorative sector ($4.0 billion according to the company).[4][5]
Markets outside the United States are becoming increasingly important: they accounted for 67% of Dentsply revenue in 2013 steady with 2012 but up from 66% and 63% the previous two years.[6][7] For 2012 acquisitions contributed all of the growth in sales (16.2%, currency effects were -3.8%). 2012 sales growth by region: Europe 27.5% (vs 17.9% in 2011), USA 13.8% (vs 4.9%), elsewhere 15.9% (vs 9.4%).[7] 88% of net sales were in dental products, 12% from consumable medical device products (casting industry).
On February 29, 2016 Dentsply combined with Long Island-based Sirona Dental Systems in a $14.5 billion merger of equals. While both supply dental products, Sirona's business centers on dental equipment in contrast with Dentsply's consumables.

History[edit]
The company which made use of the Dentsply name goes back to an artificial teeth and dental consumable products manufacturer and distributor founded by 4 New York businessmen in 1899.[8] However, the present company is largely the result of a merger in 1993 in which Gendex Corporation acquired Dentsply International Inc. for $590 million.[9] Gendex's dental x-ray equipment business which complemented Dentsply's was founded in 1983.
Dentsply was originally incorporated in 1899 as Dentists' Supply Company about the same time it made its first acquisition, a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the 4 founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist. Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage. Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting dentures, tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth.
In the early 1920s the company selected European distributor E.de Trey & Sons as its primary marketer to Europe however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also. A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time Ash company nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited. In 1925 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer.[10]
High American tariffs and increased efforts to gain market share abroad especially in Europe and Australia led the company to set up more research and manufacturing centers abroad. Its first foreign subsidiary was established in Australia as a means to acquire Natudryl Manufacturing. In the 1950s and 1960s the company developed many of the ideas used by its equipment today like tooth cleaning machine Dentsply Cavitron and Neolux which improved the finish of plastic teeth. The company renamed itself Dentsply International in 1969 due to its products' brand name being more widely recognized.[2]
Key acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976.
In 1993 after it acquired Gendex Corp in a reverse takeover it went public on the Nasdaq. The new company then purchased medical x-ray tubes supplier Eureka X-Ray Inc. which was key since Gendex was a major manufacturer of x-ray systems (Eureka X-Ray was later sold in 1994).[11] Healthco its main distributor in the US went bankrupt in 1993.[12]
In June 2011 Dentsply acquired Astra Tech, the world's third largest maker of dental implants from the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for $1.8 billion. The deal raises revenue by 25% ($535M) and was completed on August 31, 2011.[13][14]
Acquisitions in 2011 caused the value of long term debt to increase by 147% while total assets grew by 146% (current assets however decreased in value).[15] Acquisition/restructuring charges were one of the reasons net income decreased 7.4%.
Divisions[edit]
Many divisions are regional in terms of their base and the market they serve (Most in Asia are named after the country they serve) while others are focused on a specific product (e.g. Maillefer in endodontics). The divisions and subsidiaries sell their products through regionally focused distribution companies as well as dentists and dental schools.
