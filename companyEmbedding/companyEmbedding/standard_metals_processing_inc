We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  History  Standard Metals Processing, Inc. (formerly known as Standard Gold Holdings, Inc., Standard Gold, Inc. and Princeton Acquisitions, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 10, 1985. On September 29, 2009, we completed a share exchange agreement with Hunter Bates Mining Corporation, a Minnesota corporation ("Hunter Bates") and certain of its shareholders, in which Hunter Bates' shareholders exchanged all of their capital securities into similar capital securities of ours (the "Hunter Bates Share Exchange") and we adopted the business model of Hunter Bates of minerals exploration and mining. Accordingly, the Hunter Bates Share Exchange represented a change in control and Hunter Bates became our wholly owned subsidiary.  Prior to September 29, 2009, Wits Basin Precious Minerals Inc., a Minnesota corporation and public reporting company quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol "WITM" ("Wits Basin") was the majority shareholder of Hunter Bates. Hunter Bates was formed in April 2008 to acquire the prior producing gold mine properties (consisting of land, buildings, equipment, mining claims and permits) located in Central City, Colorado, known as the "Bates-Hunter Mine."  On March 15, 2011, we closed a series of transactions, whereby we acquired certain assets of Shea Mining & Milling, LLC ("Shea Mining"), which assets include land, buildings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment, water permits, mine tailings, mine dumps and the assignment of a note payable, a lease and a contract agreement with permits. We completed the Shea Exchange Agreement in order to offer toll milling services of precious minerals. Toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as gold, silver, and platinum group metals. Custom milling and refining can include many different processes to extract precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production.  The Company re-domiciled in Nevada from Colorado in March 2013. We determined that, due to a lack of connection to Colorado, it was in the best interest of the Company to move its domicile to Nevada.  Modification of Corporate Strategy  With the global collapse of commodity prices, the Company has altered its strategy to take advantage of the instability in the precious metals market and the lack of liquidity for the junior and mid-level projects in this space. The Company will seek to establish itself as a specialized mining house that can provide financing in exchange for metals streaming and royalty financing, and toll processing services to small- to medium-sized mining companies. The Company will also seek opportunities to acquire current income-producing metal streams and royalty contracts.  Supporting the initiative, the Company has put in place a proven executive team with expertise in the industry. The Company seeks to take advantage of the current dislocation in the mining sector by providing liquidity into the market for smaller mine operators who have promising development stage projects but limited access to capital.  The new management team will focus on generating low cost, non-processing passive income by providing liquidity and specialized services to mining companies in exchange for royalty and metal stream contracts, and, in some instances, common stock and warrants. It will also seek to provide toll milling services on a selective basis in exchange for long term feed contracts.  The above business will be complemented as necessary with a secondary focus on strengthening the management teams of those junior and mid-level mines which will be operating the mines upon which Standard will be dependent for revenues.  Overview of the Company  Standard Metals Processing, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "Standard Metals" or the "Company) has offices in Gadsden, Alabama, New York, New York and through its subsidiary, a property in Tonopah, Nevada. Our business plan is to generating low cost, non-processing passive income by providing liquidity and specialized services to mining companies in exchange for, royalty and metal stream contracts, and, in some instances, common stock and warrants. We will also seek to provide toll milling services on a selective basis in exchange for long term feed contracts. We are also assessing the opportunity to purchase equipment and build a facility on our Tonopah property to serve as a permitted custom processing toll milling facility which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallugircal plant, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant.  The Company is currently setting up the infrastructure to engage in the royalty and streaming business. These elements include a financial partner, which the Company is currently interviewing possible candidates. Further, the Company is seeking and has identified specialty mining counsel to provide legal support and proper contractual relationships to realize the financial fruits of these very specialized relationships. As a secondary focus, and to further strengthen these junior and mid-level mines, the Company will perform permitted custom processing toll milling which is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining can include many different processes that are designed specifically for each ore load and to maximize the extraction of precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These custom processing services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies, which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production.  We are required to obtain several permits before we can begin construction of a small-scale mineral processing facility and the required additional buildings to conduct permitted processing toll milling activities and commence operations.  WATER POLLUTION CONTROL PERMIT WITH THE NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  Through the subsidiary of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc. ("TCP"), a Water Pollution Control Permit ("WPCP") Application was filed with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection ("NDEP") Bureau of Mines and Mining Reclamation ("BMMR") for the approval of the permits necessary for a small-scale mineral processing facility planned for the Tonopah Property. The plant will perform laboratory testing, pilot testing, and custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates from mining industry clients. Processing of ore materials will employ standard mineral processing techniques including gravity concentration, froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping.  The WPCP must be approved prior to commencing the planned construction of our processing plant in Tonopah, Nevada. We are still in the technical review stage of our WPCP. While the Company awaits approval, we are preparing for construction of our processing facility which includes working with contractors that will be building the new 21,875 square foot processing plant, cleaning and preparing the property, and refurbishing a trailer that will act as our construction office.  In connection with our WPCP application, NDEP suggested that we take the following actions: (i) retain a Nevada Certified Environmental Manager ("CEM"),  Survey  In March 2013, Advanced Surveying & Professional Services, as our Professional Land Surveyor ("PLS"), completed surveys and testing of the Tonopah property required for the application of our required permits. After completion of the survey, it was determined the property is 1,183 acres. The scope of work our PLS completed includes: (i) setting a total of 19 permanent monuments at angle points along lines, (ii) setting eight permanent monuments locating US Hwy 95,  Equipment, Facility and Site Preparation  The Company received leased heavy equipment on August 1, 2013, which was used to begin cleanup of the site to prepare it for the new construction. We ordered a pre-fabricated building on November 4, 2013 and took delivery of the building on March 21, 2014.  The Company accepted delivery of additional large heavy equipment on April 1, 2014. We have completed the initial grading of specific designated areas on the 40 undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation, removing of all scrap metal, and the excavation of the building pad for the preparation of the new 21,875 square foot processing plant. With the additional large heavy equipment onsite, we have completed the removal of all the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that has accumulated on the land.  In April 2014, we purchased a complete Concrete Batch Plant, including four cement trucks, to reduce the overall cost of construction activities on site. This purchase is estimated to reduce the overall cost of construction by at least $500,000. In August 2014, we purchased an extensive array of heavy-duty construction and milling equipment for use in the construction and operation of the Tonopah facility. The heavy equipment allows us to construct the processing plant and tailings ponds using our own equipment, saving the cost of expensive lease payments. The heavy equipment includes the necessary machinery for construction including dozers, loaders, water trucks and heavy transport tractors as well as equipment required for production including crushers, screening plants, and conveyors.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  Standard Metals Processing, Inc. ("Standard Metals" or the "Company" - OTC:  The above business will be complemented as necessary with a focus on strengthening the management teams of those junior and mid-sized mining companies which will be operating the mines upon which with whom Standard will engage. Under this secondary focus, the Company become a full service permitted custom toll milling and processing company that facilitates the extraction of precious and strategic minerals from mined material. The Company is in the process of obtaining the permits needed for construction and operation of our permitted custom processing toll milling facility with state of the art equipment capable of processing gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Many junior miners do not have the capital or the ability to permit a processing facility, yet they have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. It is often cost prohibitive or impractical for these mine operators to send their materials to processing mills owned by the large mining companies, or to other customers with badly needed milling and processing services.  The Company is continuing to assess the opportunity to purchase equipment and build a facility on our Tonopah, Nevada property to serve as a permitted custom toll milling facility which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant.  While Nevada has a historic role as a mining center with good proximate geology and ample mined product, very little custom processing toll milling capacity remains in the state. During the last several decades, other processing facilities have been shuttered due to high costs of regulations and the vertical integration of milling within large mining companies leaving junior miners with few options for local milling services. As a result, Standard Metals is in a unique position among processing facilities because it is capable of true permitted custom processing. We have the only ball mill located within a custom toll milling facility within 300 miles allowing us to serve miners in the western United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.  Many junior miners are undercapitalized, have limited access to capital markets and have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. Many large mining companies reserve their milling capacity for their inventory, which does not make providing third party services worthwhile. This provides the Company with an opportunity to provide these potential customers with badly needed milling and processing services.  Currently, the Company is waiting for the approval of pending applications for the permits required for us to commence construction of our facilities to conduct permitted custom processing toll milling operations.  ROYALTY AND METALS STREAM FUNDING  Royalty and metals stream funding where the owner/recipient to-be underwrites a portion of the operator's start-up costs is a relatively recent financing innovation in the last twenty years. Where property owners have habitually received royalties from operators, this new structure permits the royalty or streaming company to create a passive income interest which incorporates attractive features, such as the right to audit, while providing the operator access to additional capital without his having to sell equity or take on debt.  Buying or creating royalties or metal streams is the classic case of paying a lump sum, up front discounted amount now for a stream of income to be paid later. The income will be derived from within a defined property boundary. Part of the upside is that any additional ores found within that boundary will also be subject to the contract at no further cost to the royalty owner. In absolute amounts, the buyer expects the cost to incorporate a large discount (e.g. 30-50%) to the nominal value of the mineable reserve and typically there are additional resources or exploration potential which are incorporated in the deal without further payment. In relative terms, the amount paid as a lump sum can typically represent anywhere from one half to several times annual the value of one year of annual production, depending on the life of the reserves.  Royalty or streaming payments will fluctuate in value with changes in metal prices.  TOLL MILLING  Toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining that are designed specifically for each ore load can include many different processes to maximize the extraction of precious metals from ore, carbon or concentrates.  Procedure  Ore is sent to our facility at the responsibility and cost of the customer. The Company will take a sample of the ore through a specific ore sampling procedure. The Company's metallurgist will test the sample on site. To obtain a quantitative determination of the amount of a given substance in a particular sample, the Company can perform wet methods and dry methods. In the wet method, the sample is dissolved in a reagent, like acid, until the purified metal is separated out. In the dry method, the sample is mixed with a flux (a substance such as borax or silica that helps lower the melting temperature) and then heated so that the impurities in the metal fuse with the flux, leaving the purified metal as residue.  If it is determined that the sample is approved for processing, the customer and the Company will then agree upon a value of the metal grade per ton. If there is any disagreement on the value, a third party referee determines the value by testing the sample. The Company charges either a flat fee per ton of the ore processed or a percentage of the precious metals extracted during processing, or a combination of both based on the amount of work that is performed.  There are various methods of extraction. The Company will determine which method to use based upon the sample received. In most situations, a series of tests will be performed on a bulk sample ranging in size from 250 to 1,000 pounds. A metallurgist will determine the best process or processes to use for the extraction based on several factors. These include the composition of the host rock, mineralization of the host rock, whether or not it is an oxide or sulphide ore body, and the particle size of the precious metal. After the metallurgist reviews these characteristics, the Company will run ore on a gold table and assays the concentrates, middlings, and tails. An assay is an investigative procedure for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount of precious metals in ore. If there is too much gold in the middling or tails, the size of the grind is adjusted to increase yield or if there is not enough gold in the middlings or tails the Company grinds the material to a coarser mesh.  Some of our miner customers will be able to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material they deposited with the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need for the Company to dispose of those tailings.  Concentrate/Leach Circuit  Concentration is the separation of precious minerals from other materials by utilizing different properties of the minerals to be separated including density, magnetic or electric and physiochemical. The Company will attempt to create a "concentrate" of minerals to reduce the size of each ton processed. The Company may also receive concentrates from customers, especially those where transport of tons of raw ore is not feasible.  The leaching process uses chemicals to extract the metals from the solid materials (concentrates) and bring them into a solution. Once the metals are in the solution, it is passed through carbon or resin columns where the precious metals are deposited onto the carbon/resin.  The metals will then be stripped from the carbon back into a different solution where they are pumped through an electrowinning circuit in a process called carbon stripping. The metals are then deposited onto stainless steel in the electrowinning circuit. After this stage, the metals are either sold or further refined off-site. The solution is recycled and used again to process additional material.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014.  Revenues  We had no revenues from any operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Furthermore, we do not anticipate any significant future revenue until we have sufficiently funded operations, executed several royalty and streaming contracts at least one of which has begun monetizing the asset and paying on the contract, and receive all permits required for us to construct our facility and begin operations.  General and administrative expenses were $12,753,801 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $12,021,604 for the same period in 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the majority of general and administrative expense was compensation expense related to options and warrants totaling $11,764,548 as compared to $10,860,224 compensation expenses related to options and warrants in the same period in 2014. In the six months ended June 30, 2015, compensation expenses as well as operating expenses increased due to the employment agreements the Company entered into with its key officers and the increase in construction costs as we have begun site preparation for the toll milling facility and costs associated with permits, research and agreements. We anticipate that future compensation expenses will increase and that certain operating expenses will continue to increase for fiscal 2015 as we continue to build the infrastructure to proceed with permitted custom processing toll milling services.  General and administrative expenses were $5,640,439 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $9,491,114 for the same period in 2014. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the majority of general and administrative expense was compensation expense related to options and warrants totaling $5,220,705 as compared to $8,755,169 compensation expenses related to options and warrants in the same period in 2014. In the three months ended June 30, 2015, compensation expenses as well as operating expenses changed due to the employment agreements the Company entered into with its key officers and the increase in construction costs as we have begun site preparation for the toll milling facility and costs associated with permits, research and agreements. We anticipate that future compensation expenses will increase and that certain operating expenses will continue to increase for fiscal 2015 as we continue to build the infrastructure to proceed with permitted custom processing toll milling services.  Other Income and Expenses  Other Income  We receive monthly payments of from $400 to $608 per month from American Tower Corporation for a cellular tower located on our Tonopah land.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $118,157, compared to $99,951 for the respective period in 2014. The 2015 and 2014 amounts relate primarily to the interest due on our notes payable: (i) the $2,500,000 secured, convertible promissory note issued to Pure Path on October 10, 2013 in accordance with the settlement agreement of same date. All prior debt was subsumed under this note, the outstanding of which was $2,229,187 plus accrued interest at 8% per annum on June 30, 2015; (ii) the short-term note payable; and  Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $64,440, compared to $47,006 for the respective period in 2014. The 2015 and 2014 amounts relate primarily to the interest due on our notes payable: (i) the $2,500,000 secured, convertible promissory note issued to Pure Path on October 10, 2013 in accordance with the settlement agreement of same date. All prior debt was subsumed under this note, the outstanding of which was $2,229,187 plus accrued interest at 8% per annum on June 30, 2015; (ii) the short-term note payable; and  Aug 19, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. Announces Corporate Name Change To Cambrian Minerals Group, Inc. To Reflect Broader Business Strategy

Sep 09, 2015, 15:54 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Standard Metals Processing, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard Metals Processing, Inc., "SMPR", (OTCBB: SMPR), announced today that it is changing its corporate name to Cambrian Minerals Group, Inc.  
The name change reflects a re-branding initiative to better align the Company's name with its current and future strategy. 
"The new name – Cambrian Minerals Group, Inc. – allows us to emphasize our new business objective of providing a full suite of strategic services to junior and mid-sized mining companies around the world," said Bobby Cooper, CEO of Cambrian Metals Group, Inc.
"As our new management team identified opportunities to take advantage of the current dislocation in the commodity markets and formulated our new strategy, it was clear that we needed a new name to better represent the scope of the Company's offerings.  The name change to Cambrian Minerals Group reflects the broader focus and strategic solutions we now provide to smaller mining operations, which include financing, processing and management expertise in consideration for long-term royalty, metals streams and material feedstock contracts," continued Cooper. 
In alignment with the name change, the Company will shortly be announcing its new website, logo and ticker symbol.
About Standard Metals, Inc.The Company intends to refocus its efforts into the acquisition and creation of royalty and streaming contracts with junior and mid-size mining companies in order to provide financing to develop or improve their mineral properties. Royalty and streaming arrangements are structures that have been successfully implemented by companies such as Royal Gold, Franco-Nevada, Silver Wheaton, and others. These structures enable mine owners to obtain alternative, less dilutive financing in exchange for an interest in the form of a 'royalty' or a 'metals stream' contract.  The Company believes the current dislocation in mining capital markets presents an ideal time to raise capital and provide an alternate form of financing for junior and mid level companies.
Additionally, Standard intends to continue to seek opportunities to construct toll-milling facilities, both domestically and abroad in selective areas. The Company believes that it can organically grow the Company faster by providing needed processing facilities in order to spur the development of mines. In conjunction with providing toll milling solutions, our strategy would be to create royalties and stream contracts with the companies operating the mines who utilize the toll milling arrangement, thus generating two separate and discrete revenue streams from a single mining property. 
Forward-Looking StatementThis release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements regarding our expected future financial position, results of operations, cash flows, financing plans, business strategy, products and services, competitive positions, growth opportunities, plans and objectives of management for future operations, as well as statements that include words such as "anticipate," "if," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "should," "will," and other similar expressions are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements, as described in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available for review at www.sec.gov, to differ materially from anticipated results, performance, or achievements. We are under no obligation to (and expressly disclaim any such obligation to) update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. Launches Royalty and Metal Streaming Initiative to Expand and Enhance its Business Model

		  Company Appoints Bobby Cooper as Managing Director of Metals and Mining
		

Jun 15, 2015, 15:14 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Standard Metals Processing, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, June 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard Metals Processing, Inc., "SMPR," (OTCQB: SMPR), announced today that it has launched its Royalty and Metals Streaming program and has hired Bobby Cooper, a highly respected mining executive to join its senior management team.
According to Sharon Ullman, CEO and Chairman, "We believe royalty and streaming provides a unique opportunity to develop an entirely new revenue and profit stream while at the same time enhancing our core business model of custom processing. The limited access to financing and processing available to independent, junior and mid-size mines has created a significant business opportunity for Standard. Bobby's involvement will have an immediate impact on the direction of the company and the success of our expanded business plan."
"Royalty and streaming arrangements are relatively new structures that have been successfully implemented by companies such as Royal Gold, Franco-Nevada and several others. These structures enable mine owners to obtain alternative financing in exchange for an interest in the form of a 'royalty' or a 'metals stream' contract. In addition to the opportunity to generate profit from each of these contracts, they also offer the added benefit of representing an opportunity for SMPR to secure feed stock for its core processing business. I am excited that Bobby has joined our firm.  His public global market experience in the mining industry combined with his eye for building growth companies is a welcome addition to our management team," said John Ryan, President of Standard Metals Processing, Inc. 
Tom Loucks, recently hired as SMPR's Vice President of Corporate Development stated, "At my prior position at Royal Gold, I was an instrumental member of the management team that developed the company's highly successful passive income streaming model. I was attracted to SMPR, because I believe that current conditions in the precious metals commodity markets are ripe to replicate that success here and believe the leverage of our custom processing business will enhance our ability to develop and grow our royalty and streaming programs. I am pleased that Bobby has joined SMPR and that we have added an industry veteran with such vast large cap and entrepreneurial experience in the mining industry to help build out our business." 
"When approached by management of Standard Metals, I immediately recognized the opportunity to work with respected industry professionals to build a vitally needed resource for junior and mid-size mining companies. I am excited about helping the management team to establish a unique full-service business model and build shareholder value,"  said Bobby Cooper, Managing Director of Metals & Mining
Mr. Cooper is a seasoned mining industry executive with more than 40 years of diversified multi-site, multi-product mining industry experience. From 1993 to 1997, Mr. Cooper served as President of Kennecott Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group, a leading mining company. During his tenure at Kennecott, Mr. Cooper was responsible for the construction and operations of numerous active mines in North America including the operations at the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah. Mr. Cooper has also served as Chairman and Director of US Silver, a silver producer located in Wallace, Idaho. In addition, he served as Chairman and Director of High Plains Uranium, a uranium exploration and production company, as director and CEO of Platinum Diversified Mining, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company listed on the London AIM, as director and Audit Committee Chair of Western Prospector, a Canadian based uranium company with mining properties in Mongolia, and as director and CEO of Ancash Mining, a private Peruvian poly-metallic project located in the Andes of Peru. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration from Arizona State University in 1972 and subsequently carried out graduate work in Industrial Technology and Mineral Economics.
About Standard Metals Processing, Inc. 
Standard Metals Processing, Inc. is being developed as a comprehensive custom toll milling and refining operation that is designed to provide entrepreneurial, early stage mining operations with a single "go-to" option for their processing needs. The facility will ultimately house multiple different processing circuits to maximize the range of possible ore and concentrate treatment options for its clients. The Company is in the process of permitting the first stage of its facility that is located near Tonopah, Nevada on private ground already owned by the Company.

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. Launches Royalty and Metal Streaming Initiative to Expand and Enhance its Business Model

Company Appoints Bobby Cooper as Managing Director of Metals and Mining




Jun 15, 2015, 3:14pm EDT














NEW YORK, June 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard Metals Processing, Inc., "SMPR," (OTCQB: SMPR), announced today that it has launched its Royalty and Metals Streaming program and has hired Bobby Cooper, a highly respected mining executive to join its senior management team.
According to Sharon Ullman, CEO and Chairman, "We believe royalty and streaming provides a unique opportunity to develop an entirely new revenue and profit stream while at the same time enhancing our core business model of custom processing. The limited access to financing and processing available to independent, junior and mid-size mines has created a significant business opportunity for Standard. Bobby's involvement will have an immediate impact on the direction of the company and the success of our expanded business plan."
"Royalty and streaming arrangements are relatively new structures that have been successfully implemented by companies such as Royal Gold, Franco-Nevada and several others. These structures enable mine owners to obtain alternative financing in exchange for an interest in the form of a 'royalty' or a 'metals stream' contract. In addition to the opportunity to generate profit from each of these contracts, they also offer the added benefit of representing an opportunity for SMPR to secure feed stock for its core processing business. I am excited that Bobby has joined our firm.  His public global market experience in the mining industry combined with his eye for building growth companies is a welcome addition to our management team," said John Ryan, President of Standard Metals Processing, Inc. 
Tom Loucks, recently hired as SMPR's Vice President of Corporate Development stated, "At my prior position at Royal Gold, I was an instrumental member of the management team that developed the company's highly successful passive income streaming model. I was attracted to SMPR, because I believe that current conditions in the precious metals commodity markets are ripe to replicate that success here and believe the leverage of our custom processing business will enhance our ability to develop and grow our royalty and streaming programs. I am pleased that Bobby has joined SMPR and that we have added an industry veteran with such vast large cap and entrepreneurial experience in the mining industry to help build out our business." 
"When approached by management of Standard Metals, I immediately recognized the opportunity to work with respected industry professionals to build a vitally needed resource for junior and mid-size mining companies. I am excited about helping the management team to establish a unique full-service business model and build shareholder value,"  said Bobby Cooper, Managing Director of Metals & Mining
Mr. Cooper is a seasoned mining industry executive with more than 40 years of diversified multi-site, multi-product mining industry experience. From 1993 to 1997, Mr. Cooper served as President of Kennecott Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group, a leading mining company. During his tenure at Kennecott, Mr. Cooper was responsible for the construction and operations of numerous active mines in North America including the operations at the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah. Mr. Cooper has also served as Chairman and Director of US Silver, a silver producer located in Wallace, Idaho. In addition, he served as Chairman and Director of High Plains Uranium, a uranium exploration and production company, as director and CEO of Platinum Diversified Mining, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company listed on the London AIM, as director and Audit Committee Chair of Western Prospector, a Canadian based uranium company with mining properties in Mongolia, and as director and CEO of Ancash Mining, a private Peruvian poly-metallic project located in the Andes of Peru. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration from Arizona State University in 1972 and subsequently carried out graduate work in Industrial Technology and Mineral Economics.
About Standard Metals Processing, Inc. 
Standard Metals Processing, Inc. is being developed as a comprehensive custom toll milling and refining operation that is designed to provide entrepreneurial, early stage mining operations with a single "go-to" option for their processing needs. The facility will ultimately house multiple different processing circuits to maximize the range of possible ore and concentrate treatment options for its clients. The Company is in the process of permitting the first stage of its facility that is located near Tonopah, Nevada on private ground already owned by the Company.

SPECIALIZATION
   OFFERS INSULATION FROM COMPETITIONMetal Center News / March 2002By Tim Triplett,
      Editor-In-Chief
Many in red metals are struggling, but Standard Metals has found success in various niches, including specialty alloys for military applications and waterjet cutting.With its focus on specialty copper and brass alloys, sales to both commercial and military markets, and sophisticated processing, Standard Metals, Inc. has remained largely above the fray in the red metals market.Standard Metals was founded in 1980 by president and owner, A. Stephen Buzash, Jr. The company operates out of a single, 20,000 square foot facility in Hartford, CT with ten long time employees."As a result of this cadre workforce, we have a depth of product knowledge that many engineers and other service centers call on for specification type questions," Buzash says.Though the company is small, the specialized nature of its products and services makes it a national, and often international, supplier.Standard Metals carries one of the largest selections of domestic red metal alloys in the United States. It sells copper, brass, bronze and thirteen different specialty alloys in its commercial line. Its military line includes copper nickel (C715 and C706), nickel aluminum bronze (C630 and C632), bronze (C903 and C922) and the Monel equivalent N04400 alloys often used for marine applications due to their resistance to the corrosive effects of saltwater.Military contractors that make parts for ships and submarines, as well as aircraft bushings, represent about 100 of the company's 1500 accounts, but make up nearly half its sales, Buzash estimates.Dealing with military contractors that sell to Uncle Sam is a double-edged sword. The number of competitors in the market is limited, and barriers to entry are significant. On the other hand, the government's specifications are extremely exacting and its paperwork requirements are daunting."We deal in highly specified material with pedigreed certification, which is not a simple market niche," Buzash says. "A lot of people have tried it and gotten out, sometimes twice." To be a government supplier, Standard Metals must have an approved quality system in place, which is continuously audited. Every ounce of metal it sells must be documented and tracked from the moment it is produced to the time it's sold, including the exact heat from which it was processed, its chemistry and composition, and physical characteristics."We have to track that material from cradle to grave and then we have to hold onto that paperwork for ten years in case there is ever a part failure," Buzash says. "In fact, we have never thrown a piece of paper away. We have twenty-one years of records."Standard Metals' inventory and sales management system, based on MetalWare software, facilitates such record keeping. "We can track heats, costs, locations, usage, customers, pricing history, duplicate quotes and many more functions," Buzash notes.So far, Standard Metals' military related business has seen no direct effect from the war in Afghanistan or the Republican administration's plans for increased defense spending. "We were the busiest when they were building Trident submarines. Now they are only building one sub a year. They're not in a big shipbuilding mode right now. If we get into one, that will help our business," Buzash says.Copper prices, currently in the seventy-cent range, are near historic lows. The market has been battered by the recessionary economy and declining demand in key markets, such as electronics and telecommunications. But the specialized nature of Standard Metals' products and Buzash's business philosophy, keep the company out of the price competition game."When you have to buy 2,000 pounds of an alloy, which you will only sell occasionally in 100-pound lots, you can't afford to discount. The price is the price," Buzash says.Unlike many distributors today who focus on reducing stock to maximize inventory turns, Buzash focuses on having what customers need when they need it. He estimates his company gets less than two full inventory turns per year."I am a stocking distributor. I make the investment in this highly certified product and lay it on the floor. When someone needs something quickly, they come to us," he explains. "I refuse to broker at all. I don't ask the customer to wait twenty weeks until I can get it from the mill."Buzash favors domestic suppliers over imports, because he believes in supporting the American economy. Standard Metals sources from U.S. market leaders such as Ansonia Copper & Brass, Bunting Bearings Corp., Concast Metal Products, Electralloy, Hussey Copper, NGK Metals and Revere Copper Products. He expresses concern that America is losing its industrial base, and that it is in danger of losing domestic sources for certain alloys used in components critical to some military applications.Processing EquipmentStandard Metals operates a variety of processing equipment: one horizontal plate saw, three vertical saws, two cut-off saws, two milling machines, three hand lathes, and one Mazak CNC turning center, in addition to bridge cranes and forklifts.But it's the company's most recent additions, two abrasive waterjet systems that offer the most promise. Waterjet systems have not saturated most markets yet, which means there is not a lot of price competition for waterjet services, Buzash says.Standard Metals invested in waterjetting in 1999 and now operates two machines made by Flow International. The latest, bought in June 2000, has a 6-ft by 12-ft bed and is capable of cutting through 6 inches of steel. The waterjet setup incorporates a closed loop system made by Ebbco, which filters the water and recycles it through the cutting head, eliminating any potential wastewater problem."We invested in waterjet processing equipment to augment our plate sales, as many of our customers wanted rings, circles and other shapes precut from plate and sheet. We have cut many different metal alloys of sheet and plate as well as, wood, rubber, plastic, fiberglass, laminate, foam, felt, cork, even granite, black onyx and glass," Buzash says.Almost any two dimensional material can be cut with abrasive waterjet to tolerances of up to +/- 0.010. "If you can live with tolerances like that, waterjet beats the devil out of normal milling" in terms of speed and price, Buzash says.Buzash expects his commercial sales to be off by 10 percent this year, compared to 2001. Sales to military customers are likely to dip 10 percent as well, unless the Bush administration increases military spending this year. He doesn't expect a significant turnaround in the economy until 2003.The poor economy makes Standard Metals' foray into waterjets all the more timely, Buzash says. "The waterjetting segment of the business will more than compensate for the lost margin of the sales decline. From a margin point of view this year, we should be fine."While the rest of the copper market is suffering from low prices, Buzash is laying in inventory, anticipating rising tags in 2003. "It's a good time to be buying inventory, at these prices."Buzash sums up his formula for success: "We have strived to be the best in a specific portion of the market. We demand loyalty from customers, employees and suppliers. We never broker, always prefer domestic over foreign regardless of price, and we do not want to grow just for the sake of being big."
