"Jack", respected philanthropist and founder of Calumet Oil Company, died Saturday evening, July 30, 2005, in Houston, TX, at the age of 79. Born January 23, 1926 in Wagoner, OK, Mr. Graves was a graduate of Wagoner High School in 1944 where he served as Senior Class President. Mr. Graves was a member of Troop 37 and was awarded his Eagle Scout Badge in 1940. Following graduation he served in the U.S. Navy until 1946. Mr. Graves lettered in Track and Football at Louisiana Tech, the conference champions while he attended. He was the Senior Class President and graduated with a B.S. degree from Northeastern State University in 1949. He received the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1985. His graduate work resulted in an M.S. degree in Geology from the University of Oklahoma. In 1947 Mr. Graves began his pursuit of the "elusive hydrocarbon" that had kept him actively engaged in oil and gas exploration and production for more than 50 years. Mr. Graves worked in exploratory activities for Republic Exploration Company, Texas Seismograph Company and Phillips Petroleum Company before starting his own oil and gas company in 1956. Mr. Graves was Chairman of Calumet Oil Company, J.M. Graves, LLC, JMG Oil and Gas LP, Green Country Supply, INC, Green Country Chemical and Green Country Submersible Pumps. Serving in the community that had been his home since 1956, he was past President and member of the Board of Directors of the Oklahoma Heritage Association, a trustee of the University of Oklahoma Foundation, INC, a trustee of Philbrook Museum and a member of the Tulsa Salvation Army Advisory Board. He had been a trustee of the Tulsa Philharmonic and the Oklahoma Nature Conservancy. Mr. Graves was a member of the First Baptist Church of Tulsa.

He was a member of the Tulsa Rotary Club, Tulsa Chamber of Commerce and Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce. He held memberships at Southern Hills Country Club, the Summit Club and Petroleum Club of Tulsa. In March, 1994, Mr. Graves received the Distinguished Eagle Award from the National Board of the Boy Scouts of America. He was past President of the Indian Nations Council and served in that capacity from 1991 to 1994. He was a National Representative of the Indian Nations Council B.S.A. Mr. Graves was inducted into the Oklahoma Heritage Association Hall of Fame in 1992 and served two years as President. In May, 2001, Nature Works constructed a pair of bronze white tail deer at 96th and Delaware in recognition of his contribution to wildlife conservation. Mr. Graves contributed yearly to OERB (Oklahoma Energy Resources Board) for clean up of "orphan" well sites and the company had received two awards from the Environmental Protection Agency and from the Osage Council for protection of underground fresh water and good housekeeping of surface locations. While Jack Graves built a life of great accomplishments, he will always be remembered for his many acts of kindness, friendship and generosity to family, friends and acquaintances. He was preceded in death by his parents, John Charles and Rada (Yount) Graves and by his sister, Jean Graves Robertson. He is survived by: his wife of 16 years, Elizabeth Ann Graves; his sons, Michael Lon Graves, John Garrett Graves and his wife, Sarah, David Allen Graves; his step-children, Rachael Redeker Dedman and her husband, Robert, William Michael Redeker and his wife, Julie; his grandchildren, Katherine Alicia Graves and her husband, Daniel Swayne, Garrett Buchanan Graves, Daniel John Graves, Adam Wheeler Graves, Catherine Elizabeth Dedman and Nancy Marguerite Dedman; three great-grandchildren, Magdalena Isabel Manning, Aidan Tennessee Swayne and Owen Michael Swayne.
