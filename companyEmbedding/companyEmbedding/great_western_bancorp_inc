Great Western Bancorp, Inc. Announces Stock Repurchase Program






Business Wire




Oct 27, 2016 7:05 AM EDT













 




























































  Great Western Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") ( NYSE:GWB), the parent company of Great Western Bank ( www.greatwesternbank.com), announced today that the Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program. Under this program, the Company may repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock, from time to time. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Repurchases may be made at management's discretion at prices management considers to be attractive, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the applicable trading price, future alternative advantageous uses for capital, and the Company's financial performance. Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements.  "The Board's adoption of this repurchase program is an important option within our overall capital management strategy and reflects our commitment to maximize shareholder returns and proactively manage capital," said President and Chief Executive Officer Ken Karels.  The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares. Any shares acquired will be cancelled and become authorized but unissued shares, available for future issuance.  About Great Western Bancorp, Inc.  Great Western Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Great Western Bank, a full-service regional bank focused on relationship-based business and agribusiness banking.

Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Announcement

                    
                            Thursday, July 27, 2017 | 8:30 AM ET
                            Fiscal Year 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Presentation





Great Western Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: GWB) is the bank holding company 
for Great Western Bank, a regional bank with over 170 branches  
in attractive markets across nine states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. 

Established 80 years ago, our banking model seeks to balance the best of being a 
"big enough" & "small enough" bank, providing capabilities typical of a much larger 
bank, with a customer-focused culture usually associated with smaller banks.

We focus on relationship-based business and agribusiness banking and are recognized 
within our markets for our local, efficient decision making. We offer small and 
midsized businesses a focused suite of financial products and establish strong relationships 
with our customers. We also provide a range of deposit and loan products to retail 
customers through several channels, including the branch network, online banking 
system, mobile banking applications and customer care centers.

We believe we have been successful in attracting customers from larger competitors 
because of our flexible approach and the speed and efficiency with which we provide 
banking solutions to our customers while maintaining disciplined underwriting standards.

By leveraging our business and agribusiness focus, highly efficient operating model, 
robust approach to risk management and presence in attractive markets, we have achieved 
significant and profitable growth—both organically and through disciplined acquisitions.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Announces Fiscal Year 2017 Third Quarter Financial ResultsBusiness WireJuly 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSIOUX FALLS, S.D.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Great Western Bancorp, Inc. (GWB) today reported net income of $35.1 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to net income of $26.4 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the same quarter of fiscal year 2016. Fiscal year-to-date net income of $107.1 million represents an increase of 22.4% compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016."At Great Western, we continue to execute on the activities we believe will prepare the organization for the months and years to come," said Ken Karels, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Over the last 12 months, we have spent time moving stressed loan relationships with little chance of rehabilitation out of the bank, especially in the agriculture segment. This has resulted in a $97 million decrease in 'Watch' rated loans, while 'Substandard' rated loans have only increased by $13 million over the same period. We have also made significant investments of time and money into the programs required of a bank our size to measure and manage the various risks we take each day. Finally, although loan growth has been slower to materialize, I am happy to report that we are seeing robust loan growth activity in the first month of the new quarter, which is expected to support our previously communicated full-year loan growth expectations in the mid-single digit range."Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin2Net interest income was $100.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $7.3 million, or 7.8%, compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to higher loan interest income driven by 8.0% growth in average loans outstanding between periods and increasing benchmark interest rates, which favorably impact the contractual interest rates on variable and adjustable rate loans. Additionally, higher LIBOR rates have also driven a significant reduction in the cost of interest rate swaps we use to hedge the interest rate risk on longer-term fixed rate loans, which we record through noninterest income. Higher loan interest income was partially offset by a $3.0 million increase in deposit interest expense, which is similarly the result of growth in average deposits outstanding and in most cases is also directly or indirectly attributable to increasing benchmark interest rates.Net interest margin was 4.00%, 3.98% and 3.95%, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016. Adjusted net interest margin1, which adjusts for the realized gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, was 3.87%, 3.83% and 3.74%, respectively, for the same periods. Net interest margin and adjusted net interest margin1 increased by 2 basis points and 4 basis points, respectively, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The yield on interest-earning assets increased by 6 basis points over the quarter, driven by lower average interest-earning cash balances as a proportion of earning assets and improving loan and investment yields. Meanwhile, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 4 basis points over the same period, including a 6 basis point increase in the cost of deposits, partially offset by a significant reduction in average FHLB borrowings outstanding. A $0.6 million reduction in the cost of interest rate swaps compared to the prior quarter is the driver of the more pronounced increase in adjusted net interest margin1 compared to net interest margin.1 This is a non-GAAP measure management believes is helpful to understanding trends in the business that may not be fully apparent based only on the most comparable GAAP measure. Further information on this measure and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided at the end of this release.2 All references to net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully-tax equivalent basis unless otherwise noted.Balance SheetTotal loans outstanding were $8.79 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of $94.4 million compared to March 31, 2017, bringing fiscal year-to-date growth to 1.3%. During the quarter, commercial real estate loans grew by $114.8 million and commercial and industrial ("C&I") loans grew by $25.5 million, partially offset by a $27.2 million net reduction in agricultural loans. Residential real estate and consumer loan balances continued to decline in line with strategy.Read MoreTotal deposits declined $132.8 million, or 1.5%, during the quarter, reducing fiscal year-to-date growth to $354.3 million, or 4.1%. Deposit activity during the quarter included reductions of $111.1 million in noninterest-bearing deposits and $21.7 million in interest-bearing deposits. Reductions in deposit balances in the third fiscal quarter are typically seasonal in nature and are consistent with prior years' results. The net loan growth and deposit outflows during the quarter were predominantly funded by an increase in FHLB advances and other borrowings outstanding.Provision for Loan and Lease Losses and Asset QualityProvision for loan and lease losses was $5.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $5.4 million for the same quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $4.3 million, or 0.20% of average total loans on an annualized basis, with the majority of net charge-offs concentrated in the C&I segment of the loan portfolio. For the comparable period in fiscal year 2016, net charge-offs were $3.0 million, or 0.15% of average total loans on an annualized basis. The ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses ("ALLL") to total loans was 0.73% at June 30, 2017, consistent with 0.72% at March 31, 2017 and 0.75% at June 30, 2016.Included within total loans are approximately $1.05 billion of loans for which management has elected the fair value option. These loans are excluded from the ALLL process, but management has estimated that approximately $7.4 million of the fair value adjustment for these loans relates to credit risk, or 0.08% of total loans. Finally, total purchase discount remaining on all acquired loans equates to 0.38% of total loans.At June 30, 2017, loans graded "Watch" were $299.0 million, a decrease of $25.5 million, or 7.9%, compared to March 31, 2017, and a decrease of $96.9 million, or 24.5%, compared to June 30, 2016. Loans graded "Substandard" were $250.6 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 5.0%, compared to March 31, 2017, and an increase of $13.0 million, or 5.5%, compared to June 30, 2016.Nonaccrual loans were $123.6 million as of June 30, 2017, with $5.0 million of the balance covered by FDIC loss-sharing agreements. Total nonaccrual loans decreased by $4.0 million during the quarter and increased by $15.4 million compared to same quarter in fiscal year 2016. Total OREO balances were $9.1 million as of June 30, 2017, an increase of $2.1 million, or 29.4%, compared to prior quarter and a decrease of $2.6 million, or 22.6%, compared to June 30, 2016. The increase during the quarter was driven almost entirely by the addition of one property into OREO.Total credit-related charges increased compared to the previous quarter and decreased compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2016. A summary of total credit-related charges incurred during the current, prior and comparable quarters and current and prior nine-month periods is presented below:                                      GREAT WESTERN BANCORP, INC.

Of this movement, $4.7 million is attributable to the net effect of the change in fair value of loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option and the net gain (loss), realized and unrealized, of the related derivatives used to manage the interest rate risk on these loans. This increase was comprised of a favorable change in the credit adjustment on the loans of $3.0 million, and a $1.7 million reduction in the current cost of interest rate swaps driven by changes in the interest rate environment.The remaining $1.7 million increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by a $0.6 million increase in wealth management income, a $0.6 million increase in other income and a $0.4 million increase in service charges and other fees reflecting higher interchange income. Management estimates that the impact of recording higher debit card interchange income (i.e., "Durbin Amendment") was $2.6 million for the quarter, which is comparable to the estimate for the same quarter of fiscal year 2016. The higher allowable interchange rates were effective through June 30, 2017 and management expects lower interchange income in the quarter ending September 30, 2017.Noninterest ExpenseTotal noninterest expense was $54.9 million for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of $6.3 million, or 10.3%, compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2016. Included in noninterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $12.2 million of non-recurring acquisition expenses; absent this reduction, total noninterest expense increased by $5.9 million, or 12.0%, over the same period. The majority of the increase was driven by a $4.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, which includes additional roles added to meet regulatory and risk management expectations, higher long-term incentive compensation and higher cost of employee benefits, which is primarily related to health insurance. Data processing costs increased by $0.8 million, driven by amortization of recent technology investments, and professional fees increased by $0.8 million, including higher legal and insurance costs.The efficiency ratio1 was 46.7% for the quarter, a decrease from 58.8% for the same quarter of fiscal year 2016 and from 47.0% in the March 2017 quarter. The elevated efficiency ratio of the comparable prior period was due almost entirely to non-recurring acquisition expenses.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017 was $18.4 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 34.5% of income before income taxes. This compares to an effective tax rate of 22.8% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, which included a non-recurring benefit of $3.7 million relating to a correction of an immaterial error of a deferred tax item from an acquisition in 2008.CapitalTier 1 and total capital ratios were 11.5% and 12.6%, respectively, as of June 30, 2017, compared to 11.6% and 12.7%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017. The common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10.7% as of June 30, 2017 and 10.8% as of March 31, 2017. The tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.3% as of June 30, 2017 and 10.0% as of March 31, 2017. All regulatory capital ratios remain above regulatory minimums to be considered "well capitalized."On July 27, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per common share payable on August 23, 2017 to stockholders of record as of close of business on August 11, 2017. The aggregate dividend payment will be approximately $11.8 million.Business Outlook"Our dedication to developing processes and programs to meet regulatory and risk administration expectations have driven increased expenses in the short term," added Karels. "But we are proud that despite these increased costs we were able to maintain a very attractive efficiency ratio and we are dedicated to managing our cost structure in the future to drive further improvements to our efficiency. We believe we are pursuing the correct priorities to allow us to manage the business and its inherent risks while positioning for revenue growth."Conference CallGreat Western Bancorp, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 on Thursday, July 27, 2017 at 7:30 AM (CT).
