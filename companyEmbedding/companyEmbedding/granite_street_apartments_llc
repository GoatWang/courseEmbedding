Overview
With a nickname like "The Constitution State," Connecticut might conjure up images of stately Colonial architecture, history-class memories of Revolutionary heroes, and the words to "Yankee Doodle" (Connecticut's official state song). But there's more than staid American history when it comes to this charming part of New England. This is the state that gave us the hamburger, Polaroid camera, color television and Pez candy! Connecticut is a land full of surprises, which makes it an interesting place to look for apartments and establish a home.
What to Expect

Connecticut's economy has always centered on manufacturing. In the 1700s, the state forged cannons for the Revolutionary War (and the citizens themselves were loyal supporters; it's said that at least half of Washington's army in 1776 was from Connecticut). Today, manufacturing continues to play a vital role in the economy, but the financial sector has been gaining importance, driven in large part by the vast insurance industry centered in Hartford.
You can expect to experience four distinct seasons in Connecticut, where the summers are long and hot, and the winters are cold and snowy. Spring can be brief, depending on the year, but fall never fails to charm residents and visitors alike with apple picking excursions and vibrant leaves that change color from bright green to brilliant reds and oranges before dropping off to blanket the ground. Summer temperatures venture into the 80s while winter drops down into the 20s and 30s. 
Where to Explore

Connecticut has numerous historical sites as well as places of serene natural beauty, all of which are easily accessible in this compact state, which measures 60 miles from north to south and 90 miles across. In fact, Connecticut is the third smallest state of the Union.
Outside of the cities, you might fancy yourself in Colonial-era New England, with the picture-perfect white churches, village greens and stately Victorian and Tudor homes. However, the major cities are peppered with all the modern American amenities you could want, from apartments for rent for every budget to trendy stores and eclectic restaurants.
Hartford Apartments

Hartford, the state capital, has a population of 121,000 in the city and 1.1 million in the greater metropolitan area. It boasts a captivating blend of big-city culture and nightlife while retaining the charm of its rich historical heritage. Hartford is home to many of the country's leading financial institutions, including Aetna, ING and Lincoln Life, to name just a few. From urban apartments for rent to stately Victorian homes, you'll find housing for every budget. Apartment rentals offer plenty of choices, with basic apartments starting in the $500 range and quickly climbing in price, especially for preferred buildings with historical significance or urban sophistication.
Bridgeport Area
Bridgeport is the state's largest city, with approximately 140,000 residents. Its most famous resident was P.T. Barnum, the founder of the "Greatest Show on Earth" and a mayor of Bridgeport. The most recognizable icons of the city are the port, lighthouse and seemingly endless number of boats going in and out of the harbor. With easy access to transportation on the sea, the city has long had an economic emphasis on manufacturing. One advantage the city offers is significantly lower-priced apartment rentals compared with the rest of the state.
New Haven Apartments

New Haven is the state's third largest city and is best known for housing prestigious Yale University. A true college town, there is an exciting combination of culture, music, international cuisine and other enticing qualities. With all those college students, it's no surprise that apartments for rent are in plentiful supply. They aren't cheap though—expect to pay from $700 for studio apartments up to $1,500 or more for snazzier digs.
What to Evaluate

If its serenity you're looking for, you'll certainly find it in Connecticut. But don't be fooled by this quaint state. Its nearness to Manhattan means that if you're willing to commute, you'll find boundless options for employment and apartments. The downside? The nearer you are to Manhattan and the train line that connects much of Connecticut to this bustling metropolis, the higher the rent on the apartment rentals becomes.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

According to U.S. Census data, New London, Conn., had a population just under 27,600 in July 2011. This architecturally interesting and historically rich city boasts a charming quality and a great value, though it is relatively secluded: It is located about 100 miles southwest of Boston and about 130 miles northeast of New York City. New London sits along the shores of the Thames River and Long Island Sound, giving it a true Atlantic aesthetic. Those searching for New London apartments for rent will delight in the city's history and current revitalization.


During the 19th century, New London had strong roots in the whaling business, and nicknamed itself "The Whaling City." The city's maritime base contributed to its growth and created strong bonds to the regional economy. New London's whaling ships patrolled the area for 80 years, putting the city in third place on the list of the strongest U.S. whaling markets.


In modern times, the city's downtown district strives to recapture the nostalgia of New London's days in the sun. The city's Waterfront District offers a number of dining, shopping and cultural activities.

Living in New London, CT

New London's Waterfront District, as are many other buildings in the area, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city's impressive Victorian and 19th-century architecture dominates the downtown landscape, allowing residents to imagine times gone by. The city's Heritage Trail passes by 30 historic places along the streets.


New London is still seen as a great value by many regional natives due to its up-and-coming nature. Neighborhood revitalization, downtown renovation, roadway improvement and other restoration projects are contributing to the city's gentrification and downtown population growth.


New London is home to 26 beautiful parks, which range in size and shape. Visitors enjoy the benefits of kid-friendly locations like Garfield Tot Lot and Little Red School House Playground, as well as nature-shrouded spots like Bates Woods Park.

New London Work and Study

New London is home to Connecticut College, Mitchell College, Ridley Lowell Business and Technical Institute, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Combined, these colleges enroll about 3,800 students each year. Outside of New London, the nearest institute of higher learning is Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic.


According to the city's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top


employers in the area are Lawrence & Memorial Hospital, Pfizer, U.S. Coast Guard, Connecticut College, the City of New London, Day Publishing Company, Cross Sound Ferry and Manpower.

Rentals in New London, CT and Cost of Living

According to city-data.com, the cost of living index in New London is 109.3, which is 9.3 percent higher than the national average. This is not uncommon for East Coast locations.

the museum and the 250-year-old New London Harbor Light.


Other museums and landmarks include the Hempsted Houses, the Monte Cristo Cottage Museum, the Shaw Perkins Mansion, the Lyman Allyn Art Museum and the U.S. Coast Guard Museum.

These apartments never last on the market because they get occupied so fast. There are tenants who have been here for years with no desire to move, and I see why.

 See What The Buzz Is About:


"I love the convenience of living in New London. I also love the fact that my apartment is managed by an experienced and thoughtful team who will respond 24/7.  I appreciate the range of rental styles available through the Tree Group. The Tree Group management and staff create and sustain community through holiday parties and community activities. Whenever I have telephoned or emailed the office with a concern, I have received a respectful, concerned response within 24 hours."- Jill"I love living here.  The building is beautiful, as is my apartment.  I have plenty of space, the neighborhood is pretty and I can walk to the heart of downtown.  All my neighbors are friendly and polite.  Michele and Kelsie have been so helpful with anything I've needed.  When my fridge stopped running, I had a new one the same day I called about it!  I would definitely recommend living here to anyone looking in the area.  This is the fourth apartment I've had in my life, and it's my favorite.  I'm very comfortable here. "- Will"I really enjoy the spacious quality of the apartments. I also appreciate the unique parts, like the antique elevator, hardwood floors, and big windows. And everyone is really friendly!"- Amy"I have been living here for two years and I don't want to leave" 

"We are so grateful that you not only allow cats, but do not require a cat deposit!"
- Tyler
