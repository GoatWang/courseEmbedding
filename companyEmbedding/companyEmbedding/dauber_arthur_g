SiC POWERMELT 
      BRIQUETTES:

DCI's SiC Powermelt Briquettes are designed to add 
      silicon and carbon to cupola-melted iron.  In addition, Powermelt Briquettes provide 
      deoxidation, increased melt rate, improved chill, reduced need for 
      expensive inoculants, and improved mechanical properties of castings. 
       Produced in a family owned business environment, and using 
      state-of-the-art equipment and processes, Powermelt Briquettes are the foundry 
      industry's benchmark for consistently high quality products.

Powermelt Briquettes come in a number of 
      different sizes, shapes, and SiC content.  For more information, 
      Contact Us.

POWERMELT 90%:

DCI's Powermelt 90% grain is  
      the world's highest quality SiC product melted in electric furnaces. 
       Powermelt is screened, in a 
      proprietary manner, on DCI property in order to deliver maximum value to 
      the foundry industry.  The extraordinary care given to Powermelt's sizing enables the melter to realize the very best results.  With a Carbon Lab on site, 
      DCI carefully monitors chemistry and sizing during each production 
      cycle.

POWERMELT 
        HP:

Like Powermelt 
        Briquettes and Powermelt, Powermelt HP is a proprietary 
      product developed for use in your treatment ladle.  This product is a 
      specially processed 97% SiC grain meant to maximize benefits by improving 
      mag alloy recovery, increase fade time, enhance nodule count, and lower 
      shrink, chill and slag defects.  Dauber spent several years 
      perfecting the sizing of Powermelt 
        HP and, like all DCI processed SiC products, boasts of 
      unprecedented inventory levels of this pristine product in order to 
      quickly react to customer needs.  To learn more about the use of SiC 
      in your ladle, Contact Us.

POWERMELTXTRA-90%:

When 
      it comes to providing the foundry industry with the ideal SiC product, no 
      one does it better than Dauber Company. PowermeltXtra is another proprietary SiC 
      granular product processed by DCI.  This is one of Dauber's newest 
      innovations and is used for cupola injection.  DCI is also one of the 
      world's leaders in the application of SiC external to the cupola.  To 
      learn more about cupola injection, Contact 
      Us.
