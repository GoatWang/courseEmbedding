Asta's Business Segments
In each business segment, Asta brings a focus on service and results that help resolve problems for people, while rewarding investors.











 
​Personal Injury Asta provides financial assistance to injured plaintiffs who need funding and advances against anticipated legal settlements. Even when the outcome is near certain, litigation can take years to work its way through the courts. Asta’s Simia Capital, LLC provides a plaintiff with a settlement advance for the necessities of living before the resolution of a case. Asta’s legal finance programs are non-recourse to the consumer. Payment is only made if there is a successful outcome of the case. Management’s strong relationship with attorneys and the American Legal Finance Association fosters financial expertise with an ability to evaluate the strength of each client’s individual legal case.
 

















 
​Structured Settlements Asta helps people unlock the value of future payments from structured settlement payments in the form of court awards, insurance settlements and other types of annuity payouts. This service provides immediate relief, allowing clients to obtain needed cash to meet their daily needs. While competitors focus on expensive broadcast advertising to identify clients, Asta’s CBC Settlement Funding, LLC delivers returns by pinpointing the most promising customers with an exquisite ability to analyze data and strong industry relationships.
 

















 
International Consumer Receivables Asta has a growing international portfolio in debt collection and debt management. The company currently operates in 3 countries in Latin America, with a vision to expand our footprint internationally. Asta’s Palisades Acquisitions subsidiary invests in debt from a wide range of issuer types, including credit card, telecommunications and consumer loans. Asta’s financial acumen and technology, creates a competitive advantage and a continuing growth opportunity in the international market.
 

















 
Benefit Advocacy Asta is a leader in helping disabled people gain access to assistance they are entitled to receive. Asta operates a specialized advocacy firm that helps people make successful appeals to the Social Security Administration to obtain long-term disability benefits needed to meet their daily needs. Asta’s GAR Disability Advocates, LLC has a nationwide network of experienced Social Security representatives. Asta is also an advocate helping veterans manage the time-consuming and complicated processes of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to obtain disability compensation for physical or psychological wounds from their service. The company’s veteran advocacy business, Five Star Veterans Disability, LLC, serves those who have served our country by cultivating a workforce of people who know the law and are veterans themselves.
