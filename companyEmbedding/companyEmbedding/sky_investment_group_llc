SKY Capital Management
SKY Capital Management -  Conservative equity and balanced account management is the firm’s core  competency. We are available to help professional private client advisors with  the oversight of their clients' direct-instrument financial assets. Equity  holdings tend to be diversified across sectors and emphasize companies with a  global footprint and steady earnings, dividend and cash flow growth. Portfolio  turnover is low, averaging 10 to 15% per year, which helps to keep clients'  realized capital gains long-term and under control.

Conservative portfolio management tailored to your client’s  particular situation
Direct investment in individual stocks and bonds for complete  investment transparency and control
Robust compliance system and platform allows  for management of quite-specific client investment preferences
Value-driven approach keeps portfolio turnover low and taxes under  control
Risk-averse, low-turnover approach seeks attractive returns with  less risk than other higher-turnover strategies


If you're interested in more  information, please contact .

Equity Management
Our  approach to managing equity portfolios is based on the premise that the  ultimate driver of share price appreciation is a company's underlying earnings  growth. Our objective is to acquire companies when they are selling below their  intrinsic value and to allow the underlying earnings growth to drive share  prices higher.

          Investment  candidates tend to be distributed across major economic sectors. The commitment  we make to a particular sector is based on our view of the opportunities and  valuations within the sector, balanced against our desire to reduce risk and  preserve capital. Generally, we try to maintain exposure to the major economic  sectors, although if the risk of loss seems excessive, we will cut back or  eliminate our position in a particular area. 

          Our equity holdings tend to be highly profitable, financially strong and  abundant generators of operating and free cash flow. We also look closely at a  company's record of capital allocation - companies that utilize their cash  resources wisely tend to make better investments than those that are less  disciplined.


Equity  Investment Strategy

Over  the course of the economic cycle, different companies and sectors tend to move  into and out of favor. We use these periods to enhance our clients' portfolios  by adding to positions which are temporarily out of favor and reducing  positions that seem excessively valued. These changes tend to be incremental  not dramatic. It has been our experience that sudden changes in portfolio  strategy increase the risk of permanent loss.
Our equity holdings tend to be highly profitable, financially strong and abundant generators of operating and free cash flow. We also look closely at a company's record of capital allocation.  Companies that utilize their cash resources wisely tend to make better investments than those that are less disciplined.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
