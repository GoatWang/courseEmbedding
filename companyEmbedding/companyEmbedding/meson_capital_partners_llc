Meson CapitalInvestment StrategyPORTFOLIO COMPOSITION AND APPROACHConcentrated Entrepreneurial Activist Longs The majority of our long portfolio is concentrated (each: 10-25% max. position size at cost) in up to 5 target companies where we actively engage to generate value via board representation or acquisition of the entire company.  Target companies are deeply undervalued vs. revenue, gross profit, or assets, and also lack external risks (e.g. commodity, regulatory, heavy debt, customer concentration).  Our companies are poised to benefit from exponential technology trends.Diversified Longs Our remaining long book consists of approximately 40 long positions that are approximately 1% exposure each of our equity and predominantly under $1bb market cap.  We utilize our proprietary machine learning platform, Gravity, to continuously search for subtle indications of value and catalysts e.g. new management with a good track record, trading at low EV/Sales.Diversified ShortsOur short portfolio consists of approximately 200 positions at 0.5% exposure each, primarily companies under $1bb market cap. We utilize our proprietary machine learning platform, Gravity, to synthesize data indicating that the long term fundamental performance of our shorts will deteriorate. This includes financial data, personnel data, industry trends, and more.  Our short book is designed to generate absolute returns and provide substantial purchasing power during broad market declines.AREAS OF EXPERTISEEntrepreneurial Business BuildingExperience improving business-operating performance to earn 2-3X unlevered returns in less than 3 years.  Successful activist strategy requires deal making savvy, operational expertise and legal skills.Data science and softwareProprietary Gravity platform provides insights into industry and management characteristics. Machine learning systems help synthesize fundamental data more completely and consistently than unaided analysts.IndustriesTarget companies across different industries, avoiding those with external risks (e.g. commodity, regulatory, debt):•    Small public companies: $100mm -$2bb market cap
•    Deeply undervalued vs. revenue, gross profits, and/or assets•    Strategically poised to benefit from exponential technology trendsPartner Login

(SEV) ("Sevcon" or the "Company") with approximately 20% of the Company's outstanding shares, today mailed its Definitive Proxy Statement in connection with the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled to take place on February 7, 2017.Sevcon is a global supplier of control and power solutions for zero-emission, electric and hybrid vehicles. The Company is based in Southborough, MA.Ryan J. Morris, CFA, President of Meson and a current director of Sevcon, today issued on behalf of Meson the following statement:"We believe the recent behavior of the Sevcon Board, including a rushed decision to amend the Company's charter, represents a troubling manipulation of corporate governance principles to wrongfully insulate the Sevcon Board. This entrenchment scheme, which was adopted at a hastily called Board meeting, has only one practical effect: to replace me, a director beneficially owning 20% of the Company, with a retired director shareholders chose not to re-elect in 2016, and to do so a full year before my term is scheduled to end. Meson Capital and its nominees seek to represent the best interests of all stockholders. We believe the costly solicitation the Company has launched to remove me is direct retaliation for Meson's moves to improve director composition. Having purchased 11 times more stock than all current directors combined, I believe that my goals are truly aligned with the best interests of shareholders."Morris emphasized that Sevcon should be acting to secure early mover advantage as the global automotive industry dramatically accelerates its shift to electrification and related technologies. One of Meson's highly qualified nominees, Tony Posawatz, led the revolutionary Chevy Volt program at GM and is uniquely suited to help Sevcon position itself for the future. He describes the current industry situation as nothing less than a complete paradigm shift that requires the most capable people to shape the future of the company for success. Meson is confident shareholders will understand that the Board's questionable decision to pursue a repetitive de-staggering initiative is a distraction from the important work of responding to the automotive industry's revolutionary change. It is up to shareholders to decide what future they want for Sevcon."Successfully participating in this changing environment requires a Sevcon Board that possess a new level of expertise," added Morris. "It calls for the ability to act with agility. It mandates both solid planning and a commitment to ensure management meets product goals and financial expectations. And it must be dedicated to building value for all shareholders."Our intent has never been to take control of the Company, as has been falsely claimed. Instead, we have repeatedly and demonstrably tried to work collaboratively with the Board to resolve the Company's important strategic business issues. Unfortunately, our efforts to resolve this proxy contest have been doggedly rebuffed by Chairman Matt Goldfarb. He owns no shares in the Company and continues to collect an increasing number of Board fees."Meson's uniquely qualified slate of nominees offers the skills and resources necessary to implement changes that will deliver positive performance at this critical juncture in company history. The impressive team of Tony, Shvet, Bryan, and Ryan understand the stakes in play far more than a group that continues to demonstrate limited interest either in the success of, or in aligning with the interests of the Company and its shareholders. Stockholders are urged to vote and return the GOLD proxy card.If you have any questions, or require assistance with voting your GOLD proxy card, please contact InvestorCom toll- free at 877-972-0090 or email: proxy@investor-com.comAbout Meson Capital Partners, LLCMeson Capital is a long-term activist fund that focuses on operationally transforming undervalued businesses.

Meson Capital Partners, 20% Stockholder, Issues Open Letter to Fellow Stockholders of Sevcon

SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - January 25, 2017) - 

Reiterates view that Sevcon has dramatically underperformed its potential and will continue to do so as long as entrenched board members led by Matthew Goldfarb ignore reality of tectonic changes in electric vehicle industry

Emphasizes new business paradigm requires new skills and that Meson's highly qualified nominees offer the vision, expertise, leadership, and hands-on skills to build value for all stockholders


Urges stockholders not to be misled -- Meson has advocated for all stockholder interests since Ryan Morris joined Sevcon's board in December 2013. Now the other directors want to silence that unapologetic advocacy by making inaccurate and untruthful claims to further entrench their own parochial interests.

Stockholders should fight for qualified board leadership and fair and effective corporate governance by voting the GOLD proxy card.

/EINPresswire.com/ -- Meson Capital Partners, LLC ("Meson"), a major and long-term stockholder of Sevcon, Inc. (NASDAQ: SEV) ("Sevcon" or the "Company") with approximately 20% of the Company's outstanding shares, today issued an open letter to the Company's Board of Directors. The full text of the letter is included below:
To our Fellow Stockholders:
Sevcon, Inc., your company ("Sevcon" or the "Company"), is at a historically important inflection point, and you get to decide its future direction. It is important for you to have the full story before you decide. 
We believe Sevcon has tremendous potential waiting to be exploited. Technological, market, and regulatory forces are aligning to create a strong tailwind that will transform the electronic vehicle industry. It is mission critical for Sevcon to be at the forefront of this tectonic change if all stockholders are going to benefit from the increase in value that can and should be generated. We had the vision to foresee this opportunity and believe we have the plans and nominees to capitalize on these powerful trends. Winning is never easy, especially in a market that is becoming dramatically more competitive with its global growth. Sevcon needs the best people at the top setting the tone for the organization and raising the standard to the level being required by the market reality.
We are Meson Capital (together with its affiliates, "Meson" or "we"), an investment firm focusing on transforming established companies that are in rapidly changing markets, that currently beneficially owns approximately 20% of Sevcon's outstanding shares, making us the Company's second largest stockholder. We believe that our concentrated, long-term ownership of Sevcon naturally aligns our interests with those of fellow stockholders generally. Our President, Ryan Morris, has been advocating for your interests since joining Sevcon's Board of Directors ("Board") in December, 2013. Now the other directors on the Board (the "Status Quo Directors") want to silence that unapologetic advocacy. 
DO NOT LET THEM! YOUR BOARD IS ATTEMPTING TO SQUEEZE YOUR GREATEST ADVOCATE FROM THE BOARD!
THE STATUS-QUO DIRECTORS FORCED THE ISSUE
Consider that leading up to the rapidly approaching 2017 Annual Meeting scheduled for February 7th: 

The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board interviewed and invited current Meson nominee Bryan Boches to join the Board to replace William J. Ketelhut and then inexplicably reversed this decision. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee, Chaired by Matthew Goldfarb, chose not to interview several other highly qualified nominees, deciding instead to put forth a stock analyst from a shuttering oil-focused hedge fund.
The Board formed a "proxy committee" consisting of, among others, a non-independent director, CEO Matt Boyle, and Mr. Goldfarb, to act as a "shadow board" in advance of the Annual Meeting.
The Board repeatedly rejected Meson's attempts to quickly, reasonably and quietly settle its differences.
The Board responded to Meson's lawful exercise of its nomination rights by adopting a governance change on Christmas Eve morning designed solely to replace the Board's one true stockholder representative with a retired director who was not re-elected to the Board by you, the stockholders, last year. What does that say about the Board's respect for the stockholder franchise?
The Board anticipates squandering $250,000 on this proxy contest they have precipitated.

ASK YOURSELF, ARE THESE REALLY THE ACTIONS OF BOARD COMMITTED "TO EFFECTIVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND RESPONSIVENESS" LET ALONE ONE THAT IS FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR STOCKHOLDERS? 
We did not want this fight. We were willing to settle amicably on reasonable terms and have never sought to add more than three new directors to an eight-member board, but were met with aggression, insults, and accusations with zero supporting facts. Enough is enough. It is time for you, the stockholders, to decide who will lead you on this journey towards future growth for Sevcon.
AN INDUSTRY IN THE THROES OF RAPID CHANGE
The electric and hybrid vehicle industry is experiencing unprecedented change. A series of factors -- regulatory, market and technological -- are converging to create massive tailwinds to push the industry forward. With the right plan and leadership, we believe Sevcon can benefit mightily. Ryan Morris described the market changes and opportunity in detail in the investor presentation that he created and gave at an investment conference on December 7th, a presentation that was largely lifted by the Company without attribution and presented to ISS last week by Sevcon as its own.
Today is the inflection point for electric vehicles -- the market is growing exponentially.

Overlapping forces are driving this:
Lithium-ion batteries continue to get approximately 10% cheaper annually
Tightening emissions regulations and environmental awareness 
Electrification enables best in class performance
Batteries and motors are commodities with low gross margins but the controller's engineering challenges are complex with high margins.
The market for controllers is fragmented and no supplier offers an integrated electric drivetrain. This is a challenging problem requiring engineering talent, business savvy, and a deep understanding of product design cycles.
If you could consolidate the controller bottleneck and offer a turnkey system solution you could create tremendous stockholder value in the next two to three years.
Sevcon can take advantage by making itself a focused industry leader with proper planning, execution and leadership.

BUT: Inadequate vision and Board leadership can result in Sevcon being permanently left behind.
On its current course: Sevcon is at risk of being halfway across the gap between the niche industrial markets that it has neglected and the massive on-road automotive markets where it has made some modest inroads but is dramatically subscale.
DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE COMPANY'S SPECULATIVE PROJECTIONS AND "ANTICIPATED" FUTURE RESULTS
The market for Sevcon's products has historically been relatively small and uncompetitive, focused on industrial applications. In 2012 the market for on-road electric vehicles began to grow rapidly and attracted much more aggressive and competitive players. Under the current board, Sevcon proved that is was incapable of creating stockholder value in a small, uncompetitive industrial market. How can stockholders expect these exact same individuals to rise to a vastly higher level of competition and market change?
 
ALL IS NOT LOST -- WE ARE YOUR ADVOCATE FOR VALUE CREATION
Since proudly joining the Board in December 2013 as a nominee of GAMCO, Sevcon's largest stockholder, Ryan Morris has been challenging old ideas and stale ways of doing business. He and Meson have purchased 11-times more stock than all of the current directors combined, aligning his interests with all shareholders, He is primarily responsible for:

Formulating and drafting the first truly comprehensive business strategy/plans Sevcon ever had. The Status-Quo Directors are now trying to take credit for these forward leaning steps despite historically advocating for hiring the bare minimum of engineering talent and only if it would lead to immediate results and rejecting to even vote on a modest R&D budget increase immediately before Mr. Morris became Chairman in July 2016.
Introducing impressive new candidates with important industry experience to upgrade your Board for your benefit.
Responsibly exercising director oversight by insisting on measurable results and true accountability.
Collaboratively putting in time and effort far beyond any of the Status-Quo Directors to drive stockholder value.
Sourcing the financing that enabled the Bassi acquisition to be possible and providing subsequent equity that prevented the Company from violating its debt covenants after management widely missed targets.
Developing relationships with leading North American academic institutions to improve engineering recruiting, which has already yielded measurable results.
Developing relationships and potential partnerships with world leaders in advanced motor technologies and high-speed charging infrastructure that present unique growth opportunities for Sevcon. 

Your vote can now give Sevcon three new uniquely qualified directors to focus Sevcon on these now-or-never opportunities and on the challenges facing the Company in the next one to three years. The dialog and debate in the boardroom must be informed and driven by those that understand the market and have experienced success in similar situations. The Company and the market will change in real time, so there is no substitute for qualified individuals at the top setting the tone.
A REAL PLAN FOR THE FUTURE
If elected, our nominees will seek to do the following:
Implement a focused strategy in the face of constantly changing market dynamics and availability of key talent:


Re-focus on the off-road & industrial markets where Sevcon brings a new competitive advantage thanks to changes in Li+ technology. Shorter sales cycles and relatively smaller markets mean Sevcon can be profitable in a shorter period of time. Sales efforts need to be redesigned around applications rather than geographic regions to align better with engineering teams.
Accelerate efforts to penetrate rapidly growing on-road markets in a focused way for applications that Sevcon has a competitive advantage while outflanking inevitable collisions with much larger competitors as they begin to enter the market in higher volume applications.
Implement a PEOPLE FIRST culture for empowering executives and engineers in order to recruit the best engineering and management talent. Sevcon currently lacks any in-house recruiting and on-boarding function which is absolutely an essential requirement to hire the best talent in an increasingly competitive market.
Develop Sevcon into a visible thought leader in the power electronics subsystem space by partnering with leading EV advocates to create a wide platform for recruiting and sales efforts as hundreds of smaller players shift towards electrification.
Develop forward deployed engineering programs to have Sevcon engineers continuously onsite at key customers to integrate more with their roadmap and engineering teams.
For the charger business: develop key strategic partnerships with utilities and independent charging infrastructure players now to design high-speed multi-stall charge infrastructure systems, recognizing their important market role in the next one to three years.


Develop accounting functionality to solve complex global issues and fixing material control weaknesses;
Manage internal organizational and structural transition from a no-growth company to a fast-growth company;
Recruit key senior executive talent and develop succession plans;
Develop transparent, performance-aligned incentive plans that hold Management accountable to appropriate goals;
Develop effective Board evaluation, recruiting and succession processes;
Develop early stage automotive industry connections, including in North America where Sevcon has not penetrated at all; and
Develop and execute growth financing plans that maximize value for stockholders while reducing risk.
HIGHLY QUALIFIED MESON NOMINEES(1)


Ryan J. Morris, CFA, 32, has been a member of Sevcon's Board of Directors since December 2013. Served as Executive Chairman of the Board of InfuSystem Holdings, Inc., until May 2015, transforming the company from near-bankruptcy in November 2011 to a growing and profitable company. Founded the profitable software company, VideoNote, LLC, after receiving a B.Sc and an M.Eng in Operations Research from Cornell University's College of Engineering.

Anthony L. Posawatz (Tony), 56, led the innovative Chevy Volt program at General Motors and has 30+ years of auto industry connections in EVs and charging.


Bryan Boches, 46, is a serial founder, experienced executive, and investor with proven success in transforming an auto parts firm larger than Sevcon.

Shvetank Jain, 32, is a serial founder and CEO at software technology companies with multiple successes scaling engineering teams, including a $750mm exit.

THE STATUS-QUO DIRECTORS WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT REAPPOINTING TWO DIRECTORS THAT RETIRED LAST YEAR AND A COAL MINING EXECUTIVE CONNECTED TO MULTIPLE BANKRUPTCIES IS THE DREAM TEAM TO MAXIMIZE SEVCON'S FUTURE VALUE

Matt Goldfarb, 45-- After 5 jobs in 6 years at questionable securities firms that either a) went bankrupt, b) were charged by regulators or c) terminated him, he served as CEO of coal miner Xinergy, Ltd where he was compensated $1.7mm as stockholders incurred $85mm in losses and then filed bankruptcy shortly after he resigned. Currently, Mr. Goldfarb serves as the CEO of Cline Mining, a coal miner that filed bankruptcy one year after he joined. He was NOT part of the Pep Boys deal team as he falsely takes credit for: he joined the board of Pep Boys months after the sale was in motion. He has purchased zero shares of Sevcon, in direct violation of Company director stock ownership policy.
Dr. Marvin G. Schorr, 91, was voted not to be re-elected last year by stockholders and was added as a fully compensated, non-voting Emeritus director by the Board.
David Steadman, 79, refused to serve on the Company slate last year due to a dispute with fellow director Walter M. Schenker. Mr. Steadman became a fully compensated, non-voting Emeritus director.
William J. Ketelhut, 64, served as head of the audit committee of the Board when material weakness over internal controls failures became an issue in Q2 2016. Mr. Ketelhut's only other public board experience is serving for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. which filed for bankruptcy relief after large losses during his tenure.
For clarity -- voting the GOLD Proxy will have no impact on the directorships of: CEO Matthew Boyle, Glenn J. Angiolillo, Walter M. Schenker, and Paul O. Stump.

THE STATUS-QUO DIRECTORS, LED BY RECENTLY INSTALLED CHAIRMAN MATTHEW GOLDFARB, HAVE MADE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO ADOPT SCORCHED EARTH TACTICS
Specifically, Matt Goldfarb has personalized this proxy contest by:

Trying to bully Mr. Morris with threats to tarnish his reputation and harm his ability to work in the investment industry.
Making outlandish demands that Mr. Morris withdraw his superb nominees and agree to a non-market three-year standstill just to hold on to his directorship, even though stockholders like you already elected Mr. Morris to serve until 2018.
Stonewalling Mr. Morris' multiple good faith attempts to settle and avoid this costly, ill-considered proxy contest that Matt Goldfarb and the Status-Quo Directors have foisted upon you.
Running roughshod over normal Board conduct by squelching open discussion and prohibiting Mr. Morris and even some of the Status-Quo Directors from speaking, making us at times question whether this a Board or a dictatorship.
Interfering with Mr. Morris' right to information by imposing newly invented hurdles that apply to no other director.

Yet Mr. Goldfarb and the other Status-Quo Directors want you to believe that they are qualified and motivated to have their hands on the wheel at this transformational moment in Sevcon's history. Meson believes that this pattern of disturbingly aggressive conduct is a window into their true motivation, and ask you, the real owners of Sevcon, to draw your own conclusions.
We believe Meson's non-control slate is better suited to deliver the brighter future for Sevcon that you so richly deserve. 
WE ASK YOU TO VOTE FOR A BETTER FUTURE AT SEVCON
The future is now. Opportunities are there for the taking in the electric car industry, and Meson offers to you a non-control slate of directors qualified and committed to overseeing our detailed plans to vault Sevcon to a pole position in the EV space. The choice is yours. We ask you to embrace our vision by signing and returning the GOLD proxy card today. Time is critical -- the Company cannot afford to lose another year of progress.
Thank you for your consideration.

Meson Capital Partners, 19% shareholder, Nominates Highly Qualified Board of Director Candidates for Sevcon Annual Meeting
Change at the Top is Required to Unlock Sevcon's Potential in an Accelerating Market for Electrification

SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - December 21, 2016) -  Meson Capital Partners, LLC ("Meson"), a major shareholder of Sevcon, Inc. (NASDAQ: SEV) ("Sevcon" or the "Company") with approximately 19% of the Company's outstanding shares, today announced it is nominating 6 highly qualified candidates for election to Sevcon's Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting scheduled for February 7, 2017 in order to reserve its rights to run a short or majority slate for the upcoming meeting.Ryan J. Morris, CFA, President of Meson and a current director of Sevcon today delivered the following open letter to Sevcon Directors and shareholders, highlighting his belief that:Sevcon is uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift towards electrification of mobility and autos as the market grows exponentially.Time is of the essence. There is a window of opportunity to capture market share that will close within 2 years if not approached thoughtfully and decisively.The current board oversees Sevcon's underperformance and yet refuses to embrace the need for change.Meson's highly qualified candidates have successful track records in businesses highly relevant to Sevcon's current situation.December 21, 2016From: Ryan J. Morris, CFA, President, Meson Capital Partners, LLC & Sevcon DirectorDear Fellow Board Members and Shareholders:I am writing to you today to express my belief that Sevcon is uniquely positioned to benefit from the global transition to electrification of motion and away from fossil fuels. Never before in the Company's long history has an opportunity of this magnitude presented itself. The rapidly declining cost of lithium-ion batteries and tightening emissions standards are causing explosive growth in the market for electric and hybrid drivetrains.Sevcon has a proven unique ability to engineer the critical and highly challenging power electronics designs required to enable electrification of a wide variety of applications. If the Company is to take advantage of the current market acceleration and maintain a strong position, it must scale this capability rapidly. This is a new challenge the company has never faced before and in our opinion, is incapable of tackling today without improvements to the Board.The Board must agree on and implement a vision for the Company to determine how we want to embrace this opportunity. We can either:Maintain the status quo of slow to no growth and modest profitability by resisting change and reacting to immediate customer requests, ORSeize the opportunity and shift to a more entrepreneurial, growth-oriented model.It is not responsible for this board to choose Option A above. The stakes are too high and opportunity is much too great. Shareholders, employees and our customers deserve more from the Board, and deserve it without delay.To date, I have worked hard in collaboration with senior executives of Sevcon and other outside industry experts and entrepreneurs to create and put forth a plan to rapidly grow the Company. Once the engineering design window begins to close, market share could be determined for decades to come by virtue of the long product life-cycles and high switching costs. Rapid change is being imposed on our company by the market. This reality demands a thoughtful and decisive response that the current board is not delivering.Unfortunately, despite many attempts to be collaborative -- including this Monday's meeting, where you rejected a reasonable settlement to avoid the necessity of Meson formally nominating our highly qualified director candidates -- it has proven impossible to drive change in the boardroom internally.We should no longer be willing to focus on preserving the current state of affairs and associated slow organic growth and unacceptable shareholder returns. We must introduce new directors who have relevant successful track records, entrepreneurial energy and experience navigating changing markets. With these new members, our responsibility will be to formulate and implement a comprehensive plan to exploit this market opportunity. The tone starts at the top. The current board does not have the interest or the capabilities necessary to guide and oversee Sevcon safely and profitably through this time of great change and opportunity.Accordingly, we have nominated six highly qualified director candidates who shareholders will have the opportunity to select to represent their interests at the upcoming annual meeting on February 7, 2017. This action reserves our full rights to run a short or majority slate at the upcoming annual meeting.Highlights of our highly qualified and independent nominees:Tony Posawatz led the innovative Chevy Volt program at GM and has 30+ years of auto industry connections in EVs and chargingShvet Jain is a serial Founder and CEO at software technology companies with multiple successes scaling engineering teams, including a $750mm exitBryan Boches is a serial Founder, experienced executive, and investor with proven success in transforming an auto parts firm larger than SevconPam Colburn has deal making and capital raising experience for $billion growing technology companiesHoward Gross has a wealth of CEO experience transforming industrial companies through technology changesJoe Whitters is an experienced CFO and has chaired numerous audit committees and solved complex global accounting challenges at $billion+ growing companiesReality demands progress. Failure due to inaction is not an option. I look forward to having an open dialog with the current board on making this transition as smooth as possible and with shareholders for their input.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Meson Capital Partners, LLC ("Meson"), a major and long-term stockholder of Sevcon, Inc. (NASDAQ:    SEV) ("Sevcon" or the "Company") with approximately 20% of the Company's outstanding shares, believes Sevcon is in clear violation of SEC proxy rules for failing to identify Bassi Holdings as a participant in its solicitation. 








The violation stems from a press release issued in Lugo, Italy on January 25, 2017 by Bassi Holding S.r.l. ("Bassi"), which owns 11.4% of Sevcon's outstanding shares, regarding the solicitation of proxies for the Company's February 7, 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Meson believes this Press Release constitutes a solicitation by the Company and the Company has failed to disclose to stockholders that Bassi is a Participant in the Company's solicitation. Meson calls on the Company to immediately correct and update its filings, and provide such revised information to its stockholders to ensure that all in fact receive accurate information in advance of the Annual Meeting. 
Important Stockholder Information Sevcon will hold its 2017 Annual Meeting of stockholders on February 7, 2017. Meson has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and mailed to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement and form of GOLD proxy card in connection with the 2017 Annual Meeting. The definitive proxy statement contains important information about Meson, the 2017 Annual Meeting, and related matters. 
STOCKHOLDERS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO READ MESON'S DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT SOLICITATION MATERIALS. THESE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
