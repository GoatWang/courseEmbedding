Servato Corp. Key Developments

Servato Launches New Network Battery Management Appliance
Mar 22 16
Servato Corp. announced the launch of its newest remote management appliance, the Smart Power System-148™ (SPS-148™). The new appliance builds upon the SPS™ line’s unique capabilities and value proposition for automated management and monitoring of standby batteries. The SPS-148™ utilizes Servato’s proprietary Adaptive Charge Management™ technology to extend the life of stationary lead-acid batteries and reduce associated maintenance costs. Built to monitor a single-string of 12V batteries or to be daisy-chained to monitor additional strings, the new appliance is the smallest in the SPS™ product line and can be used in space-constrained cabinets. The smaller form factor expands the universe of sites addressable by Servato technology. The SPS-148™ also extends Servato’s Internet of Things (IoT) offering by expanding the solution’s monitoring and management capabilities beyond batteries. The appliance can be configured or augmented with additional sensors to monitor and manage a wider array of equipment at remote sites and to capture important environmental and performance inputs such as temperature and issues with other equipment on site.

Article Part 1 of 4: Adaptive Charging: Extending Battery Life and Reducing Costs in Mission Critical Telecommunications Standby Systems



Adaptive Charging: The Inefficiencies of Continuous Float Charging (Part 1 of 4)
This article originally appeared in the 2Q17 edition of Battery Power Magazine. The article is published on our blog in 4 parts. You can access the full article here.
The accelerating growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications require continuous investment in telecommunications networks to provide the connectivity for millions of new devices. As more devices connect to the Internet, service outages become more impactful to the people and businesses that rely on IoT applications. Safeguarding telecom networks from power outages is the Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery. Stationary VRLAs are ubiquitously used at broadband, wireless and cable sites, and millions are in service across the country. Unfortunately, almost all of these batteries, and thus the sites that depend on them, are vulnerable to a reliability-damaging standard: float charging. While float charging will maintain batteries at full charge, it can have a damaging impact on the service life of the battery, which introduces risk and increases maintenance costs. There is a better way to charge batteries, Adaptive Charging, that mitigates the degrading effects of float charge, extending battery life and reducing maintenance costs.

Article: Powering Your Network Vision



Powering your network vision (Reality Check)
This article originally appeared on RCR Wireless' website on June 13th, 2017. To read the original article, click here.
The internet is now the “reason for being” for most wireless and wireline service providers. Indeed, wireless and wireline networks are becoming the internet (homage to Eric Schmidt’s original vision of the network becoming the computer). These broadband networks are increasingly looking and working less like “telecom” networks and more like wide-area IT networks as switches give way to routers and lots and lots of “things” get connected to them. And, of course, none of the internet infrastructure works if it is not powered, which calls to mind yet another critical but distinct network – the power distribution infrastructure of the power utility. Despite being regulated by the same PUC commissioners, planning between and among carriers and power utilities is pretty much non-existent.   Their network planning sessions are disconnected, parallel discussions that need to be more integrated if we are to ensure that the Internet is always powered on.

Several customers including FairPoint, New Lisbon Telephone Company, and Gila River Telecommunications have already pre-ordered the product. FairPoint has had pilot units installed for several weeks.
"FairPoint has been deploying Servato appliances for over two years in New England. We've seen the benefits of adaptive charging and the insights gathered from the managed appliance. The SPS-148™ will help us deploy the technology to more sites due to its smaller size and more flexible installation options. We are excited to now have the option to extend Servato’s technology to more of our network,” said Jim Caron, Network Engineering Manager of FairPoint New England.
“We are excited to bring this new product to market,” said Chris Mangum, CEO of Servato. “The smaller form factor offers customers the opportunity to utilize Servato’s unique battery optimizing technology at even more of their sites. Our expanded monitoring and management capabilities drive an even stronger ROI for our customers. We have been very pleased by early customer interest and orders.”
The SPS-148™ also extends Servato’s Internet of Things (IoT) offering by expanding the solution’s monitoring and management capabilities beyond batteries. The appliance can be configured or augmented with additional sensors to monitor and manage a wider array of equipment at remote sites and to capture important environmental and performance inputs such as temperature and issues with other equipment on site.
About ServatoHeadquartered in New Orleans, La., Servato is a leading provider of active battery management solutions to telecom, power, transportation, and solar companies. Servato’s solutions allow leading companies and infrastructure operators to reduce CapEx and OpEx by extending battery life, reducing maintenance costs and streamlining operations.

			Active Battery Management		


Alex Rawitz 


			2017-03-14T19:40:46+00:00		



What is Active Battery Management?Active Battery Management is Servato’s term for a complete battery maintenance regimen that utilizes cutting edge technology to improve battery health, automate processes, and generate savings. It is more than simple battery monitoring.




ManualTechnicians perform manual tests on a cycle, perhaps seasonally or every 6-12 months.

Periodic manual tests with long periods of time without State of Health Data.
Requires two site visits: One to find the bad battery, a second to replace it.
Limited information to act on during outages.
Relies on spreadsheets or notebooks to store data.
Results in replacing full strings for one bad battery.
Float-charging keeps batteries ready but overcharges and accelerates failure.
Time consuming, expensive, wasteful.





MonitoringSensors are placed on the batteries to measure and record data.

Provides real-time data.
Accuracy is limited by float-charging.
No ability to control the way batteries are charged to extend life.
Often have limited software functionality.
Float-charging keeps batteries ready but overcharges and accelerates failure.
Alerts for failed batteries, outages, and other issues.





ManagementServato’s appliances and software are used to test, charge, and manage batteries remotely.

All conventional, monitoring-only alerts plus more.
Works with your rectifier to control the charge of the batteries, extending life.
Only charges when necessary, rests batteries 80% of the time.
More rest means less heat generated by batteries, reducing cooling costs.
Measurements from rested batteries provide more accurate data.
Predictive analytics and signatures allow for early detection of failures.
Resting batteries are always available for instantaneous backup power with electronic switching.
The most complete remote management solution on the market.





The Servato Difference – Control Charge For Better Data and Extended Life
Servato’s DC Management platform-as-a-service offers companies more ways to generate capital and operational savings because our products go much deeper than conventional monitoring products. 


Most battery monitoring devices sit passively on the batteries recording and transmitting data, but they have no ability to remotely change the way the batteries are managed. 


Servato’s appliances connect in line with the rectifier and the batteries to control the charge, resting the batteries when necessary and charging when it is needed. 


No other companies offers this same unique, patented ability.










More Than MonitoringServato is the only company with battery monitoring appliances that have the ability to also manage (charge) the batteries.
Instead of just recording battery health data, firmware on the appliances uses proprietary algorithms to adaptively charge, ensuring that batteries are not overcharged, thus extending battery life.
What Makes Servato Appliances Unique?




Extend Battery LifeWhen batteries spend more time at rest but are still frequently and properly charged their lifespan is lengthened.
Servato has conducted laboratory and field tests that have proved our unique ability to extend battery life for 12V VRLA batteries. We have other resources available detailing the science of what we do.
Check out the data on battery life extension




Magnified SavingsFloat-charging not only overcharges the batteries and contributes to a faster decline, it uses more electricity than necessary. 
Heat generated by the batteries also raises cooling needs in cabinets and remote COs. By adaptively charging batteries Servato can save companies on electricity and cooling.
Case Studies




 Utilize the Internet of Things for Site Managment

Taking full advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, Servato equips technicians with the ability to monitor and manage more than just batteries. We are working to put an end to unnecessary truck rolls.
 




Detect Hidden Equipment Issues
Rectifier issues can go undetected but still have an adverse affect on batteries. Because of the uniqueness of Servato’s hardware the Smart Power System appliances are the only ones capable of detecting certain issues. Learn about how Servato was able to detect a faulty controller module.

Generator Monitoring (Coming Soon)
The SPS product line will soon include the ability to monitor the start, stop, and use of generators at critical sites. Knowing the generators have kicked on is just as important as being aware of the batteries.

Enivronmental Conditions
With a USB Temperature probe the Smart Power System Product Line can display temperature in ActiView. Customers have used this functionality to identify defective HVAC and heat exchange systems. Humidity and other environmental monitoring coming soon.
