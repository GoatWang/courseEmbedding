SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 7, 2017 /Intelligent Cloud Resources (OTCQB:ITLL) is pleased to announce the successful completion of its due diligence process over the past couple of months.
Christopher Pay, Director of ITLL., commented "We are pleased with the results of our due diligence and are confident that the acquisition once complete will bring recurring annual revenues, and significant product and operational advantages to the company. It has been a productive process for both parties and we are now working to complete the definitive agreements to complete the transaction as soon as possible."
With legal due diligence complete, ITLL and 2440499 Ontario Inc. are finalizing the terms of a Definitive Agreement (further to the non-Binding MOU announced by ITLL on December 14, 2016) to be executed as soon as possible.
About Intelligent Cloud Resources:The Company has been aiming to offer cloud enabler and cloud broker services to small and medium sized organizations in Canada and plans to expand to such organizations. The launch of the Fonia "All Access Mobile" platform will be a powerful consumer oriented addition to Intelligent Cloud Resources' product offering. The Fonia "All Access Mobile" Inc. is an end-to-end Mobile solution, working primarily to serve individuals, regardless of their credit score, through an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) Fonia Mobile (and Fonia Financial). The Fonia "All Access Mobile" service will bundle a traditional handset sale with a hybrid phone rate plan (a mix of prepaid and postpaid plans) and a prepaid MasterCard. This benefits customers immediately as they can achieve a more affordable phone plan through Fonia, and build a credit history.

Intelligent Cloud Resources Inc. Successfully Closes Acquisition with 
      Completion of Definitive Agreements.






KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intelligent Cloud Resources (OTC: ITLL) is pleased to announce the 
      successful completion of the previously announced acquisition of the 
      innovative Fonia “All Access Mobile” platform perpetual license and 
      world class Leagoo Smart Phones for the territory of Florida. This will 
      be the first step in a program to launch the product and service in 
      multiple territories.
    

      Christopher Pay, Director of ITLL., commented “Today is a historic 
      moment for us. The closing of this transaction opens the door to create 
      substantial growth opportunities and deliver even greater benefits for 
      our customers. We are excited to have completed the transaction which 
      provides compelling value to our stockholders, benefits our customers 
      and provides new opportunities for our employees."
    

      With legal due diligence complete, ITLL and 2440499 Ontario Inc. have 
      finalized the Definitive Agreement (further to the non-Binding MOU 
      announced by ITLL on December 14, 2016) .
    

      About Intelligent Cloud Resources:
    

      The Company has been aiming to offer cloud enabler and cloud broker 
      services to small and medium sized organizations in Canada and plans to 
      expand to such organizations. The launch of the Fonia "All Access 
      Mobile" platform will be a powerful consumer oriented addition to 
      Intelligent Cloud Resources' product offering.
    

      The Fonia "All Access Mobile" Inc. is an end-to-end Mobile solution, 
      working primarily to serve individuals, regardless of their credit 
      score, through an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) Fonia Mobile 
      (and Fonia Financial). The Fonia "All Access Mobile" service will bundle 
      a traditional handset sale with a hybrid phone rate plan (a mix of 
      prepaid and postpaid plans) and a prepaid MasterCard. This benefits 
      customers immediately as they can achieve a more affordable phone plan 
      through Fonia, and build a credit history.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


There are many companies who compete directly with the products and services we
plan to develop. These companies may already have an established market in our
industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other
resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer
than we have been developing ours. Additionally, there are not significant
barriers to entry in our industry and new companies may be created that will
compete with us and other, more established companies who do not now directly
compete with us, may choose to enter our markets and compete with us in the
future.

Intelligent Cloud’s principal competitors are AFORE Solutions, Allstream,
BlackIron Data, Bell Business Solutions, Cacloud, Canadian Cloud Computing Inc.,
Canadian Web Holding, Centrilogic, Cirruc Computing, Cloud A, Cloud Dynamics,
Canada Post Vault Service, Cloud Post Vault Service, Cloud Path, Cloud Pockets,
Netelligent and Radiant Communications. Some of these competitors are private
corporations with no requirement for financial disclosure, Intelligent Cloud is
unable to ascertain the size of their market and there is no way of quantifying
and qualifying what position on a sale’s basis Intelligent Cloud is in relative
to its competition.


Company Description
Intelligent Cloud Resources Inc. was incorporated on March 27, 2014 under the 
laws of the State of Nevada as a development stage company. The Company aims to 
offer cloud enabler and cloud broker services to small and medium sized 
organizations in Canada and plans to expand to such organizations


 in the United 
States in the future. The Company has a strong development team who can build 
all types of applications on cloud computing and can perform cloud enabler and 
cloud broker services. Intelligent Cloud Resources will help businesses to break 
away all of the barriers associated with installing software on to physical 
hardware by making the software from anywhere on the globe. For those 
enterprises that have security concerns for deploying their applications on a 
public cloud, the Company can also build a private cloud accessible to only 
those persons who work within the organization.

As of the date of this prospectus, neither our website nor any other application
has been developed to the point that we can describe specifically its nature or
its scope. We anticipate that we will receive revenue from the sale of our cloud
services to companies. Specifically, Intelligent Cloud plans to offer the best
quality cloud computing services to the SME (small and medium-sized enterprises)
sector of Canada for a monthly service charge and eventually expand such
services to this sector in the United States.

As of the date of this prospectus, the amounts of the prices for our products
have not been determined. As our platform and services are developed, we will
determine the prices based upon our costs and the prices of competing services.
---

We are incorporated in the State of Nevada, on March 27, 2014. Our official
business address is located in 2602 Innisfil Road, Mississauga, Canada ON L5M
4H9. Our telephone number is (647) 478-5633.
