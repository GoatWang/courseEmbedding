KPI-150











KPI-150







Program: KPI-150


KPI-150 is a novel peptide inhibitor of the Kv1.3 channel from the same family of compounds as ShK, which KPI Therapeutics is developing as a topical cream for atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and other dermatological complications associated with inflammatory diseases.
KPI-150 targets the Kv1.3 channel on effector memory T cells, which are the subset of T cells that are found at the sites of inflammation in a variety of different autoimmune diseases, like atopic dermatitis. These T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Blocking the Kv1.3 channel inhibits the effector functions of these effector memory T cells and helps ameliorate disease. We have shown through immunohistochemistry analysis that the infiltrating T cells in atopic dermatitis express high levels of the Kv1.3 channel and are thus a good target for KPI-150 treatment.



KPI-150 is in the ShK family of molecules from our Autoimmune Platform
KPI-150 topical cream for diseases like atopic dermatitis
Novel Kv1.3 channel target is immune sparing






Therapeutic Need - Atopic Dermatitis


Atopic Dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune skin disease that affects over 15 million people in the USA alone.  More than half of those patients are under the age of 20.  The current treatment options such as moisturizers and corticosteroids only address the symptoms of the disease and stronger immunosuppressive drugs can have debilitating side effects.  Even with current therapeutic options these patients still have many unmet needs.



Over 15 million people in the US have Atopic Dermatitis
Over 50% of patients are under the age of 20
Patients need safer and newer drugs that can be used long term






Development Status


We have shown that topical administration of KPI-150 works in a number of in vivo efficacy models. KPI-150 has demonstrated dose-dependent activity in an atopic dermatitis model where the drug was able to reduce inflammation, T cell infiltration, and markers of inflammation when applied topically.  Based upon non-clinical models we anticipate KPI-150 will be well tolerated.
Drug formulation optimization and skin penetration assessments are ongoing to further develop KPI-150 for dermatologic applications.



Topical administration has been shown to work in various in vivo models reducing inflammation along with associated biomarkers
The ShK family is well tolerated as shown in our toxicology studies
KPI-150 is undergoing formulation optimization

KPI-190











KPI-190







Program: KPI-190


KPI-190 is a part of the ShK family and is being developed as an eye drop for use in several eye diseases including uveitis and Dry Eye Syndrome (DES).
Pathogenic T cells have been shown to play a role in autoimmune eye disease as T cell infiltration and cytokine and chemokine production lead to tissue damage in the eye. Kv1.3-HIGH autoreactive TEM cells have been identified in uveitis and DES making these conditions a good option for development of KPI-190.



KPI-190 is an eye drop being developed for several eye diseases 
KPI-190 is a Kv1.3 inhibitor and is part of the ShK family
The ShK target has been found to be involved in diseases such as uveitis and dry eye syndrome 






Therapeutic Need - Uveitis


Uveitis is one of the leading causes of blindness in the US and remains a significant unmet need.  There are over 680,000 uveitis patients in the US with very few treatment options.  Dry eye syndrome affects over 13 million people a year in the US alone and current treatments are either ineffective at treating the underlying disease or are toxic if used over long periods of time.



Uveitis is a leading cause of blindness
Over 680,000 people suffer from uveitis in the US
There are over 13 million DES patients in the US in need of new therapies 






Development Status


KPI-190 has demonstrated proof of concept efficacy in models of anterior uveitis, and topically administered it has good penetration into the anterior chamber.



Proof-of-concept efficacy has been shown in uveitis models
The drop has good penetration into the eye

About Us
KPI Therapeutics is developing potentially game changing autoimmune therapies. Our platform targets autoimmune diseases of the skin that have tens of millions of sufferers in the US and are a multi-billion-dollar market. Our lead drug, dalazatide, has completed Phase 1 trials and demonstrated clinical activity in patients. In diseases such as atopic dermatitis, myositis, and lupus, KPI is tackling the largest issue - a lack of effective drugs with minimal side effects. KPIâs next-generation drugs are more targeted and immune sparing than current treatments.
