Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Appoints Lawrence Olanoff, M.D., Ph.D., to Board of Directors

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Ironwood

      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IRWD) announced today the appointment

      of Lawrence Olanoff, M.D., Ph.D., to its board of directors as well as

      to its pharmaceutical advisory committee. Dr. Olanoff has more than 30

      years of pharmaceutical industry experience and has been a leader in

      clinical development, discovery research, strategy and operations for

      several companies ranging from small biotechnology firms to large

      pharmaceutical corporations. Most recently, he served as a director and

      as chief operating officer of Forest Laboratories, Inc.



      Ironwood also announced that current board members Joseph Cook, Jr. and

      David Ebersman have decided to transition off of Ironwood's board of

      directors at the end of their current terms in office, at Ironwood's

      2015 annual meeting of stockholders.

    


      "Ironwood is committed to attracting board members who have business

      savvy, a strong interest in our company, absolute integrity, great

      strategic judgment and an owner-oriented mindset. We believe Larry has

      each of these qualities, as well as tremendous breadth of experience

      guiding the development of more than 30 FDA-approved drugs utilized

      across a broad range of therapeutic needs. He is a great clinical

      pharmacologist, with extensive knowledge of pharmaceutical development

      and regulatory history, and he is also a masterful business strategist

      and leader. This rare combination of skills makes Larry a valuable

      representative of our shareholders and advisor to our scientists," said

      Peter Hecht, chief executive officer of Ironwood.

    


      Hecht continued, "As I welcome Larry to the board, I would also like to

      recognize Joe and David for their years of service to our shareholders.

      Joe has been an Ironwood director since co-founding the company in 1998

      and has impacted virtually every significant decision we have made,

      shaping our strategy, development and culture while helping us to remain

      focused on the needs of patients. Similarly, David's strategic wisdom

      has guided Ironwood through many opportunities as we have grown as an

      organization."

    


      "I have had the opportunity to work collaboratively with the Ironwood

      team over the years, and I have developed great respect for their

      ingenuity and ability to innovate. They brought the first in a new class

      of gastrointestinal products to the market, developed an innovative

      commercialization strategy to deliver that product to patients and

      physicians, and built a pipeline of gastrointestinal programs targeting

      diseases that impact millions of patients," said Dr. Olanoff. "I look

      forward to joining Ironwood's esteemed board and, in my role with the

      pharmaceutical advisory committee, collaborating closely with their

      impressive R&D team."

    

Dr. Olanoff most recently served as a director and as chief operating

      officer, and previously as executive vice president and chief scientific

      officer, of Forest Laboratories, Inc. (acquired by Actavis plc). He also

      previously served as president and chief executive officer of Celsion

      Corporation, senior vice president of clinical research and development

      at Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation (now a division of the Novartis

      Group), and in a number of positions at the Upjohn Company. Dr. Olanoff

      is currently an adjunct assistant professor and special advisor to the

      president for corporate relations at the Medical University of South

      Carolina (MUSC), a member of the MUSC foundation for research

      development board, and chairman of the board of the Clinical

      Biotechnology Research Institute at Roper St. Francis Hospital. He

      received his doctorate in biomedical engineering and medical doctor

      degree from Case Western Reserve University.

 Ariel Pharmaceuticals Appoints Board Chair 

Ariel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Appoints Forest Laboratories, Inc. Veteran as Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors
Lawrence S. Olanoff, M.D., Ph.D. to Serve as Chairman and to Advise Ariel on the Development of its Lead Compounds
Broomfield, CO, May 22, 2012 - Ariel Pharmaceuticals, a private, development-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for major unmet medical needs, announced today it has appointed Lawrence S. Olanoff M.D., Ph.D., as Chairman of the company's Board of Directors (BoD).
"With more than 30 years in healthcare, Dr. Olanoff is a seasoned industry veteran and we're eager to benefit from his insights and experience as we advance Ariel's lead programs through the clinic," said Steve Orndorff, President and CEO of Ariel Pharmaceuticals.  "We believe we have a well-devised strategy for moving the company forward and I'm confident the addition of Dr. Olanoff will add to our success as we aim to achieve several milestones in the near future, including Phase II results of our lead compound, AP-1531, a best-in-class EP4 receptor antagonist."
Dr. Olanoff was most recently President and Chief Operating Officer for Forest Laboratories, Inc. from 2006 through 2010 and continues to serve as a Director.  From 1995 to 2005, he was responsible for the leadership of research and development activities for the company while serving as Forest's Executive Vice President of Scientific Affairs.  Dr. Olanoff was also appointed President and CEO of Celsion Corporation from 2005 to 2006.
Adding to his industry experience, Dr. Olanoff was previously Senior Vice President of Clinical Research and Development for Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation.  For nearly a decade prior to Sandoz, Dr. Olanoff held multiple positions at The Upjohn Company, where his last position was Corporate Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs.  Since 1990, Dr. Olanoff has directed the development of 30 approved NDAs or supplemental NDAs including such major products as Namenda®, Lexapro® and Neoral®.
In addition to serving as Chairman of Ariel's BoD, Dr. Olanoff is currently Special Advisor to the President for Corporate Relations at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC).
Dr. Olanoff remarked, "Given the strong scientific background and pedigree of the current members of Ariel's management team, board of directors and scientific advisory board, as well as the quality of the developmental pipeline, I believe the company is well-positioned for success moving forward.  Having been previously involved in the development of anti-inflammatory analgesic agents and eicosanoid research, I am particularly interested in the EP4 receptor target selected by Ariel and am delighted to have the opportunity to participate as a member of the Board as the company advances its lead programs through development."
Dr. Olanoff earned his M.D. and Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University and was a medical resident and clinical pharmacology fellow at MUSC.  He has authored or co-authored numerous scientific publications in clinical pharmacology, drug delivery and pharmacokinetics.
