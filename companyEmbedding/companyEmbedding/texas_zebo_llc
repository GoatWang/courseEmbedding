Company Summary OpportunitySince 2002, Zebo LLC has successfully operated and grown Halcyon Coffee + Bar + Lounge concept, in Austin, Texas. The first 10 years were formative as the concept was established and operationally proven in Austin's premier entertainment area, the warehouse district. After more than 14 years serving coffee and spirits to Austinites, Halcyon has become a landmark known throughout Texas for its caffeinated cocktails, table-side s'mores and relaxed vibe.In 2013, Halcyon expanded to another warehouse district redevelopment project in Southtown San Antonio, the Blue Star Arts Complex. Halcyon quickly became a local favorite and exceeded all sales projections. Along with Halcyon's expansion into San Antonio, Zebo launched a new concept called Stella Public House, an Artisan wood-fired pizzeria serving local farm-to-table fare and craft beer. Stella opened to wide acclaim and was recognized as one of the "Best New Restaurants" by San Antonio magazine.Halcyon and Stella Public House have grown steadily and successfully in each location they've opened. The company intends to build on this growth by adding new stores across Texas. Specifically, in 2017 Texas Zebo has secured leases in Dallas's Greenville Avenue neighborhood and Austin's Mueller Town Center Development. Additionally, discussions have begun for future Houston openings. Each of these architecturally-driven locations are within communities that have favorable demographics for both Halcyon and Stella Public House and topline revenue is forecast to double between 2016 and 2019 with the addition of the three new locations in Austin, Dallas, and Houston.ProductTexas Zebo manages two restaurant concepts. The first concept, Halcyon Coffee + Bar + Lounge, is a unique urban hangout that combines the comfort and convenience of a coffeehouse by day with a laid-back bar and lounge atmosphere at night. Halcyon, which means peaceful and carefree is the ideal place to meet up with friends or to get some work done away from the office. Halcyon offers fast casual gourmet food for breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and snacks in the evening, alongside a comprehensive coffee program and a full bar with signature cocktails (e.g. Chocolate Espresso Martini), craft cocktails, and a curated wine and beer selection.Stella Public House has the perfect combination of rustic charm and urban sensibility. Stella, which means star in Italian, is a place customers can go anytime of the week to experience a high-quality meal without needing reservations or fancy attire. Stella offers Artisan-style wood-fired pizzas made from locally sourced organic ingredients and a well curated selection of rotating craft beers from breweries across the nation. Stella's Napolitano style pizzas are smaller, softer, and puffier than typical American pizza with carefully blistered crusts from the wood-fired oven. Additionally, there are farm-to-table sharable small plates and a wood-fired brunch offered every Saturday and Sunday.Halcyon's interior design is modified to give it a unique character tailored to each neighborhood in which it is located. In Austin's warehouse district, the original location, the interior is rougher around the edges and has more bar seating. In San Antonio, Halcyon has more designed touches, reflecting the art community in which it sits. There is also more café seating which matches the broader food menu offered out of their full kitchen.The Stella Public House in San Antonio is punctuated with several communal tables that encourage large groups, sharing, and meeting new people. Salvaged rustic woods are matched with exposed brick and natural fabrics that warm up the space. There is also an open kitchen so customers can enjoy the artistry up close and absorb every element of the experience.Use of Proceeds and Product RoadmapWith the success of Halcyon and Stella Public House in Austin and San Antonio, Zebo is continuing its Texas roll-out with new locations being planned in Dallas, Austin and ultimately Houston. As Halcyon has proven after 14 years in operation, both concepts are long-lasting neighborhood restaurants that can grow and evolve over time to serve the local community for decades. Halcyon Dallas is slated to launch in 2017 in the old Café Brazil building (pictured below) on Greenville Avenue, a high-traffic food and beverage street. The building is 3,600 square feet with a large patio in the front.The flagships for Halcyon and Stella Public House are slated to launch in Austin's landmark Mueller Town Center (pictured below) in the spring of 2017. The Mueller Town Center District is a planned 1.2 million square foot mixed-use lifestyle district that will include retail, dining, and entertainment options as well as offices, apartments, and condominiums. Halcyon and Stella Public House will have 5,600-square feet of space located in the anchor corner of the new entertainment district facing the park and adjacent to The Thinkery Children's Museum. The lease has been executed, the design is complete, and engineering is underway. Construction will begin in January 2017.Further down the line, Texas Zebo expects to open a Houston location in 2019-2020. Texas Zebo is already in talks with the developer of Rice Village, a shopping district that offers a mix of retailers, restaurants, and nightlife just minutes from Rice University. Plans are to build another landmark Halcyon and Stella Public House in the new Phase II development of that district.Business ModelIn 2015, Halcyon Austin drove 41% of Texas Zebo's revenue, generating over $1.8 million in sales. The largest sales category was coffee and non-alcoholic beverages, followed by bar sales, and then food. Halcyon Austin's net operating income was about $293,500 in 2015 - resulting in an operating margin of 15.6%. San Antonio's Halcyon and Stella Public House each contributed about 30% to Texas Zebo's revenue, generating a combined $2.75 million in sales in 2015. The focus on menu and competitive pricing has driven significant growth in food revenue at the San Antonio Halcyon. While bar sales were still the largest revenue source in 2015 (over $550,000), food sales were a close second (over $450,000). Stella Public House's brunch launch at the end of 2015 was a notable contributor towards generating morning/lunch business. In 2015, food generated roughly two-thirds of sales at Stella and bar sales made up the remaining one-third. In total, the San Antonio location earned net operating income of over $358,000 in 2015, resulting in an operating margin of 13.1%.   Historical Financials In 2015, Texas Zebo's revenue was over $4.6 million, a 16% year-over-year increase from nearly $4 million in 2014. Sales more than doubled in 2013, the year Halcyon and Stella Public House opened in San Antonio.Year-to-date as of October 2016, Texas Zebo has generated over $4 million in revenue, a 5.4% year-over-year increase. Over the same time period in 2015, the company made nearly $3.85 million in revenue.Note: Only 2014 and 2015 financials have been subject to a financial reviewYear-to-date as of October 2016, Texas Zebo's operating expenses have totaled more than $2.20 million compared to around $1.97 million over the same period in 2015.Note: Only 2014 and 2014 financials have been subject to a financial reviewTexas Zebo is profitable and has generated over $431,000 of net operating income thus far in 2016. Net income is up 14% year-over-year from 2015 when the company generated nearly $378,000 of net income through October 2015.Note: Only 2014 and 2015 financials have been subject to a financial review   Industry and Market Analysis The U.S. coffee and snack shops industry is expected to generate $39.6 billion in revenue in 2016 and grow at an annualized rate of 2.7% over the next five years to reach $45.4 billion in 2021.i The industry continues to benefit from rising household incomes which contributes to increased spending on food prepared outside of the home. Coffee and snack shops have strategically shifted to provide healthier, gourmet menu items. Since these gourmet items typically come with higher price tags, it has resulted in an increase in industry profit.To attract health-conscious consumers, high-end pizza restaurants have also begun offering more entrée salads, flatbreads, whole-wheat and gluten-free crusts, locally grown produce, and organic ingredients. Pizza restaurants in the U.S. brought in revenues totaling $40.3 billion in 2015. By 2020, industry revenue is expected to increase to $43.7 billion. Pizza chains currently experiencing the greatest growth are those targeting consumers from higher income brackets. The number of households earning over $100,000 is expected to increase 0.8% over the next few years. This combination of an increase in high-income households and the push towards local foods is expected to create higher demand for higher-end pizza restaurants and gourmet pizza.iiToday, more people want to know where their food comes from. This has driven the popularity of local foods, including locally grown produce and locally sourced meats, seafood, and even beer and wine. Local and regional food sales in the U.S. totaled more than $12 billion in 2014, and it is estimated sales could grow to $20 billion by 2019.iii Consumers are willing to pay more for locally grown foods. In a 2015 survey, nearly half said they were willing to pay up to 10% more for locally grown or produced foods, and almost one-third said they were willing to pay up to 25% more.iv   Competitors Jo's Coffee: Jo's Coffee opened in Austin on South Congress Avenue in 1999.

The Second Street location serves full breakfast, lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch as well as alcohol.Houndstooth Coffee: In 2010, Houndstooth Coffee opened its first location in Austin on North Lamar.
