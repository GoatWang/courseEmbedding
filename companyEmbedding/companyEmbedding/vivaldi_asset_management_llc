Wealth Planning

The conventional approach to financial planning is to establish a sound plan that can withstand the test of time. While we are staunch believers in managing wealth with a long-term view, we are not proponents of a ‘set it and forget it’ mentality. Clients who prefer to work with us commit to a more proactive course of action – focused on developing a strong sense of confidence, achieving their financial goals, and protecting their legacy.
At Vivaldi, wealth planning is not a one-time exercise – your plan evolves as your family’s life and wealth change. Accordingly, every client works with a dedicated Wealth Adviser who is responsible for delivering a superior experience to meet the ongoing goals of each client. We believe this approach is more personal, more customizable, and more relevant than the standard framework employed by most wealth management firms. Throughout the year, you can expect to receive proactive communication and high touch service, as we aspire to become the focal point of our client’s life and wealth affairs.
Investment Policy Design
The foundation of your long-term investment strategy is the investment policy statement (IPS) that frames your needs, objectives and priorities across time and generations. Each client works with their Wealth Advisor to determine how much risk they are comfortable taking, wherein we quantify your investment objectives into a specific risk tolerance. When crafting your IPS, your Wealth Advisor will help you identify any areas of special focus that will impact planning to your future, such as retirement income needs, funding a higher education for your family’s next generation, or managing tax consequences.
Asset Allocation
We are proponents of asset allocation as the primary driver of risk and return within our clients’ portfolios. Together, you and your Wealth Advisor will work collaboratively with our distinctive Asset Allocation Committee – the firm’s principal professionals with decades of investment experience – to create a personalized portfolio allocation for your family. Vivaldi breaks down the investment universe into six specific asset classes to better facilitate goals-based investment planning for its clients.

Equities
Fixed Income
Liquid Alternatives
Hedge Funds
Real Estate
Private Equity & Special Situations

The chief objective is not to create confusion over asset class descriptions; rather, it is to create an open architecture for aligning family goals and portfolio asset allocations.
Tax Efficient Management
It is not what an investor makes, it is what they keep that is most important. To that end, we are diligent about optimizing after-tax returns for our clients. When possible, we allocate tax-inefficient into tax-advantaged retirement accounts, tax-efficient investments into taxable accounts, and harvest losses to offset capital gains.
 











Investment Management

We employ an in-house investment Research Team that operates as a supportive unit to our Wealth Planning organization. The Research Team is not distracted by other obligations. The sole purpose of this dedicated team is to find investment solutions to enhance client portfolios. In 2016 alone, Vivaldi’s Research Team:

Met with over 150 portfolio managers
Participated in over 250 portfolio manager meetings
Performed initial review of 500 investment strategies
Participated in over 25 capital introduction events
Attended 5 top-tier investment conferences

Investment due diligence covers all asset classes and strategies, wherein the Research Team maintains a proprietary database of portfolio managers and all related correspondence. Importantly, the Research Team does not perform database screens to identify prospective portfolio managers. The vast majority of currently sourced funds and strategies have come through our extensive network and reach within the investment community as opposed to any screening process. Prior to making any allocations, the Research Team sets the expectation with the fund manager and their team that we require a certain level of transparency and access. We perform ongoing due diligence on our approved managers to ensure that are adhering to their style, process and investment mandate.
Investment Strategies
We focus on providing investment management strategies and access to alternative investments, such as hedge funds, real estate, private equity, and special situations to create balanced client portfolios. We pride ourselves on maintaining a proprietary approach to identifying unique alternative investment strategies across:

Arbitrage
Credit
Event Driven
Long/Short Equity
Mortgages
Multi-Strategy
Real Estate
Private Equity & Special Situations

 
Access to Institutional-Quality Managers
The Research Team utilizes their expertise and extensive network to gain access to institutional-quality portfolio managers with a demonstrated “edge” in their investment universe. We create value by sourcing and providing a differentiated manager line-up that clients cannot receive at the large wire-houses or on the other plug-and-play platforms. We firmly believe this process provides the best opportunity to generate positive absolute returns for clients irrespective of broader market movement. Vivaldi will negotiate lower portfolio manager fees for clients when possible.
Manager Research & Due Diligence
When performing due diligence, there is no substitute for experience and judgement. Our investment and operational due diligence process is methodical and rigorous. When we examine a manager, we not only review the manager and their performance history, but also their infrastructure, back office support, and service providers. Finding portfolio managers with a unique investment edge is equally as important as verifying that they have the controls in place designed to protect our clients’ assets.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Calculation methodologyThis tool provides a list of Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds that are similar to the non-Vanguard product you specified. All data and scoring is provided by Morningstar®, including the methodology which scores each product on a scale of 10 (most similar) to 0 (least similar). The methodology is based on several factors, including the category, special criteria, portfolio allocation, and performance of each product.The general process for generating a list of similar funds is as follows:First we conduct a preliminary screen of all Vanguard ETFs and mutual funds based on the category and other attributes of the product specified. For products with less than three years of performance history, a Performance score of "0" will be displayed, and the Overall similarity score will match the Portfolio score.Then we score each product based on how similar its portfolio is to that of the product you specified.We also score each product based on how similar its performance has been relative to the product you specified.Finally, we calculate an overall similarity score.The Performance score utilizes the last 36 months of returns, as of each month end. The Portfolio score utilizes the most recent daily portfolio stored for the fund and will reflect that portfolio at any given time.
