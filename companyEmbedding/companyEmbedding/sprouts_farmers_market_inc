Products[edit]
Sprouts Farmers Market aims to sell products that are minimally processed and free of hydrogenated fats as well as artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, and preservatives. The company sells many USDA-certified organic foods and products that aim to be environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible.
Sprouts offers beef products that range from choice cuts to grass-fed. [3]
Also available are fermented milk products, also known as cultured dairy foods, cultured dairy products, or cultured milk products. They are dairy foods that have been fermented with lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Leuconostoc. Examples include cultured kefir, yogurt, buttermilk, sour cream, butter, cottage cheese, kumis, and villi.[4] Cultured products contain high levels of probiotics. Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed.[5][6][7]
Sprouts carries a variety of produce, including sprouted and fermented options. Sprouting is the practice of germinating seeds to be eaten raw or cooked. [8][9][10]
Fermented foods such as kimchi, sauerkraut, and fermented vegetables enrich the diet through development of a diversity of flavors, aromas, and textures in food substrates, preserve substantial amounts of food through lactic acid, alcohol, acetic acid, and alkaline fermentations, enrich food substrates with protein, essential amino acids, and vitamins and eliminate antinutrients.[4][11][12]
Charitable giving[edit]
In 2015, Sprouts founded the Healthy Communities Foundation, which supports local health and wellness related causes.[13] In 2016, the Healthy Communities Foundation awarded $1.6 million in grants to nonprofit organizations. [14]
Animal product concerns[edit]
In April 2017, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released an investigation into cage-free Sprouts egg supplier Morning Fresh Farms on social media platform NowThis.[15] Sprouts disputed the accuracy of the video, which showed mass starvation and dehydration at the farm.[16]
Possible merger[edit]
A possible merger between privately held Albertson’s and publicly traded Sprouts Farmers Market was announced Q1 2017. Albertson’s is a private conglomerate and Sprouts is publicly traded and would have to be taken private. Discussions are ongoing.[17]

In April 2017, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released an investigation into cage-free Sprouts egg supplier Morning Fresh Farms on social media platform NowThis.[15] Sprouts disputed the accuracy of the video, which showed mass starvation and dehydration at the farm.[16]
Possible merger[edit]
A possible merger between privately held Albertson’s and publicly traded Sprouts Farmers Market was announced Q1 2017. Albertson’s is a private conglomerate and Sprouts is publicly traded and would have to be taken private. Discussions are ongoing.[17]

Products[edit]
Sprouts Farmers Market aims to sell products that are minimally processed and free of hydrogenated fats as well as artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, and preservatives. The company sells many USDA-certified organic foods and products that aim to be environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible.
Sprouts offers beef products that range from choice cuts to grass-fed. [3]
Also available are fermented milk products, also known as cultured dairy foods, cultured dairy products, or cultured milk products. They are dairy foods that have been fermented with lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Leuconostoc. Examples include cultured kefir, yogurt, buttermilk, sour cream, butter, cottage cheese, kumis, and villi.[4] Cultured products contain high levels of probiotics. Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed.[5][6][7]
Sprouts carries a variety of produce, including sprouted and fermented options. Sprouting is the practice of germinating seeds to be eaten raw or cooked. [8][9][10]
Fermented foods such as kimchi, sauerkraut, and fermented vegetables enrich the diet through development of a diversity of flavors, aromas, and textures in food substrates, preserve substantial amounts of food through lactic acid, alcohol, acetic acid, and alkaline fermentations, enrich food substrates with protein, essential amino acids, and vitamins and eliminate antinutrients.[4][11][12]
Charitable giving[edit]
In 2015, Sprouts founded the Healthy Communities Foundation, which supports local health and wellness related causes.[13] In 2016, the Healthy Communities Foundation awarded $1.6 million in grants to nonprofit organizations. [14]
Animal product concerns[edit]
In April 2017, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released an investigation into cage-free Sprouts egg supplier Morning Fresh Farms on social media platform NowThis.[15] Sprouts disputed the accuracy of the video, which showed mass starvation and dehydration at the farm.[16]
Possible merger[edit]
A possible merger between privately held Albertson’s and publicly traded Sprouts Farmers Market was announced Q1 2017. Albertson’s is a private conglomerate and Sprouts is publicly traded and would have to be taken private. Discussions are ongoing.[17]

Products[edit]
Sprouts Farmers Market aims to sell products that are minimally processed and free of hydrogenated fats as well as artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, and preservatives. The company sells many USDA-certified organic foods and products that aim to be environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible.
Sprouts offers beef products that range from choice cuts to grass-fed. [3]
Also available are fermented milk products, also known as cultured dairy foods, cultured dairy products, or cultured milk products. They are dairy foods that have been fermented with lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Leuconostoc. Examples include cultured kefir, yogurt, buttermilk, sour cream, butter, cottage cheese, kumis, and villi.[4] Cultured products contain high levels of probiotics. Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed.[5][6][7]
Sprouts carries a variety of produce, including sprouted and fermented options. Sprouting is the practice of germinating seeds to be eaten raw or cooked. [8][9][10]
Fermented foods such as kimchi, sauerkraut, and fermented vegetables enrich the diet through development of a diversity of flavors, aromas, and textures in food substrates, preserve substantial amounts of food through lactic acid, alcohol, acetic acid, and alkaline fermentations, enrich food substrates with protein, essential amino acids, and vitamins and eliminate antinutrients.[4][11][12]
Charitable giving[edit]
In 2015, Sprouts founded the Healthy Communities Foundation, which supports local health and wellness related causes.[13] In 2016, the Healthy Communities Foundation awarded $1.6 million in grants to nonprofit organizations. [14]
Animal product concerns[edit]
In April 2017, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released an investigation into cage-free Sprouts egg supplier Morning Fresh Farms on social media platform NowThis.[15] Sprouts disputed the accuracy of the video, which showed mass starvation and dehydration at the farm.[16]
Possible merger[edit]
A possible merger between privately held Albertson’s and publicly traded Sprouts Farmers Market was announced Q1 2017. Albertson’s is a private conglomerate and Sprouts is publicly traded and would have to be taken private. Discussions are ongoing.[17]

Breaking            
Nearly $29 billion in market cap wiped from Amazon's new rivals in grocery space
Amazon's  dramatic push into the grocery space with its planned acquisition of Whole Foods  has wiped nearly $29 billion from the aggregate market cap of rivals in the grocery category. Wal-Mart Stores  lost over $14 billion in market value, Costco's  market cap fell by more than $5 billion, and Target  and Kroger  each saw a reduction of more than $3 billion. U.S.-listed shares of Ahold Delhaize , which owns U.S. chains including Giant and Food Lion, saw its value drop by nearly $2 billion. Smaller rivals including Supervalu , Sprouts  and Weis Markets  also nursed heavy losses.

Sprouts Farmers Market 'significantly impacted' by deflation due to its focus on fresh items
Sprouts Farmers Market Inc.  said Thursday it was "significantly impacted by deflation, which has been increasing over the last 18 months" because 60% of its sales are in fresh products. Speaking at the Deutsche Bank dbAccess Global Consumer Conference, Sprouts' Chief Financial Officer Bradley Lukow said the first quarter experienced 300 basis points of deflation, with double-digit deflation in produce. "Into the second quarter of this year, we went from double-digit deflation on cost in produce to almost flat," Lukow said, according to a FactSet transcript. Amazon.com Inc.  announced this morning that it has extended Prime Now one- and two-hour delivery to Denver, including Sprouts merchandise. And Sprouts stock was downgraded Thursday at Morgan Stanley to equal-weight based on valuation. Analysts say they remain positive on Sprouts because it's a strong player in the natural and organic segment, and was the only food retailer it covers with positive same-store sales. "However, we now believe the shares are fairly valued relative to future growth potential," the note said. The price target remains at $23. Sprouts shares are down nearly 9% in Thursday trading, but are up more than 19% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  is up 8.5% for 2017 to date.

Read More             Meat Counter Most conventional supermarkets cut corners in one of these areas, but not Sprouts. We run our Meat Department the same way they used to in the old days – because we know how good it can be when things are done right. After all, we shop here, too! Read More             Bulk Foods We feature a scoop-your-own wonderland of more than 200 barrels and bins full of rices, spices, aromatic coffees, granolas, trail mixes and the like. All available in scoopable servings or right-sized packages that won't waste your money or any materials.

Read More             Grocery Aisles  Sprouts provides a steppingstone to better health, in part through the thousands of natural and organic food products we carry in our grocery aisles. From soup to spices, pasta to pickles, and juice to garbanzo beans, we offer good-for-you foods at great-for-you prices. Read More             Deli Counter  In the Sprouts Deli, you'll find a broad array of fresh pre-packaged Mediterranean dips, ethnic specialties, salads, and cold cuts; more than 500 cheeses from around the world; and our very own comforting line of wholesome (and microwaveable) Country Kitchen Meals. Read More             Fish & Seafood Though our stores are not usually located near the harbor, our buyers sure are. Our seafood merchants rise before dawn each day to scour the freshest catch on both coasts, negotiate for great prices, and rush it to our stores. Read More             Dairy Case  No matter the source – cows, goats, soy, almonds and coconuts – the Sprouts Dairy Department brings you the freshest natural creamery choices (dairy and non-dairy) for less. Read More             Bakery Shelves  As soon as you enter Sprouts, you will be enticed by the aroma of fresh-baked artisan breads, shelves of sandwich bread, chewy chocolate-dipped macaroons, chunky chocolate chip cookies and old-fashioned pies. Read More             Frozen Foods  In Sprouts' right-sized, table-height freezer case, you'll find a breadth of frozen selections that's enough to give you chills. There are natural and organic entrees and side dishes, of course, along with frozen vegetables and desserts aplenty. But there are also plenty of hard-to-find specialty items, like gluten-free breads and non-dairy ice creams. Read More             Beer & Wine Some farmers markets feature not just fruit, but the fruit of the vine. So the Sprouts wine merchants are always hard at "work," trying out wines from California, Australia, Chile and Europe, as well as the great specialty beers of the world. A sampling of their "research" is available at most Sprouts stores. Read More             Vitamins & Supplements Within our Vitamin Department at Sprouts, we carry more than 7,500* top quality products, including vitamins, natural remedies, functional food, lifestyle support, and herbal supplements.

Breaking            
Nearly $29 billion in market cap wiped from Amazon's new rivals in grocery space
Amazon's  dramatic push into the grocery space with its planned acquisition of Whole Foods  has wiped nearly $29 billion from the aggregate market cap of rivals in the grocery category. Wal-Mart Stores  lost over $14 billion in market value, Costco's  market cap fell by more than $5 billion, and Target  and Kroger  each saw a reduction of more than $3 billion. U.S.-listed shares of Ahold Delhaize , which owns U.S. chains including Giant and Food Lion, saw its value drop by nearly $2 billion. Smaller rivals including Supervalu , Sprouts  and Weis Markets  also nursed heavy losses.

Sprouts Farmers Market 'significantly impacted' by deflation due to its focus on fresh items
Sprouts Farmers Market Inc.  said Thursday it was "significantly impacted by deflation, which has been increasing over the last 18 months" because 60% of its sales are in fresh products. Speaking at the Deutsche Bank dbAccess Global Consumer Conference, Sprouts' Chief Financial Officer Bradley Lukow said the first quarter experienced 300 basis points of deflation, with double-digit deflation in produce. "Into the second quarter of this year, we went from double-digit deflation on cost in produce to almost flat," Lukow said, according to a FactSet transcript. Amazon.com Inc.  announced this morning that it has extended Prime Now one- and two-hour delivery to Denver, including Sprouts merchandise. And Sprouts stock was downgraded Thursday at Morgan Stanley to equal-weight based on valuation. Analysts say they remain positive on Sprouts because it's a strong player in the natural and organic segment, and was the only food retailer it covers with positive same-store sales. "However, we now believe the shares are fairly valued relative to future growth potential," the note said. The price target remains at $23. Sprouts shares are down nearly 9% in Thursday trading, but are up more than 19% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  is up 8.5% for 2017 to date.

The Minneapolis-based company's sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.3% in its fiscal first quarter ended April 29, thanks in part to lower foot traffic and average orders.

Read More             Meat Counter Most conventional supermarkets cut corners in one of these areas, but not Sprouts. We run our Meat Department the same way they used to in the old days – because we know how good it can be when things are done right. After all, we shop here, too! Read More             Bulk Foods We feature a scoop-your-own wonderland of more than 200 barrels and bins full of rices, spices, aromatic coffees, granolas, trail mixes and the like.

There are natural and organic entrees and side dishes, of course, along with frozen vegetables and desserts aplenty. But there are also plenty of hard-to-find specialty items, like gluten-free breads and non-dairy ice creams. Read More             Beer & Wine Some farmers markets feature not just fruit, but the fruit of the vine. So the Sprouts wine merchants are always hard at "work," trying out wines from California, Australia, Chile and Europe, as well as the great specialty beers of the world. A sampling of their "research" is available at most Sprouts stores. Read More             Vitamins & Supplements Within our Vitamin Department at Sprouts, we carry more than 7,500* top quality products, including vitamins, natural remedies, functional food, lifestyle support, and herbal supplements.
