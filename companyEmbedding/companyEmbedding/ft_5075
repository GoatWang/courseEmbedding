Customer Questions & Answers








            Can this rug be folded and rolled for storage?
        

            We are moving into a new house. I was wondering if it would be possible to fold the rug and roll it to a smaller size for storage purposes and to save space.
        
Asked by: n2sports

            it is a heavier rug and I would be careful to keep it rolled and not flattened as that would break the binding on the underside. It can not be rolled to a size smaller than the 10 foot length without damaging it.

This rug turned out to be exceptionally nice upon delivery. While the actual color of the rug online often can be an issue in terms of matching what you actually get, this particular rug was quite close to how it looks online. The blues are actually brighter than they appear online. We purchased a rug backing pad and unrolled this beast and here are some positives:

*The rug did not have a lingering nasty smell like others I had read about before purchase.
*The rug was not difficult to get to lay down and completely flattened out within a couple of days.
*The rug is very thick, nice and soft.

Overall, we are very pleased with this particular purchase.

This rug is of a nice thickness, weight and quality.  The color is more vibrant than the picture shows but it is a very pretty blue with gray and white.  The colors work very well with my decor and I am very pleased with this purchase.  Great price for a quality rug.

The colors are beautiful and just as I had expected this product to be. The corners are still a little upright, but through time I know it'll flatted out. When I first got it, I ironed it out with a damp towel over it and the clothing iron and helped tremendously.

        Awesome
Wasn't sure what to expect ordering a rug online, but this was amazing!. It matches my decor perfectly, and it's very comfortable to walk and lay on. Colors are as pictured, and it layed out flat pretty quickly..2 days Max. It was packaged very well. And the size I ordered was perfect description says 7x10x10, but it's really 8x11, and couldn't beat the price for that size. Great weight, doesn't need a rug mat/cushion under it. Once it's down, it's not moving. Only complaint is shipping took almost 2 weeks due to UPS running into issues. Want to order the matching runner next

        Shipping could be better!
The rug is beautiful and nicely made. However arrived with the ends of packaging plastic ripped so my rug was dirty on the ends! Because I didn't want to reorder and return to just have the same thing happen, I decided to clean with carpet cleaner. I don't think I should have to do that when spending over $200.00 for an item.

Have ordered several sizes of these rugs. Colors vary a bit due to different runs. If you are a stickler for continuity it might bother you. Taking the approach they are mimicking antiqued wear and fading. The largest room size rug I ordered diappeared into shipping neverland but Home Depot shipped us another one.

            Does this rug have any teal in it? I would like to match with teal curtains
        


Asked by: Melissa

            I bought this rug in both the gray and aqua options and have them both in my home. I wouldn't say that they have any teal in them. The aqua color is definitely more aqua rather than teal, and the blue accents in the rugs are a deep royal blue -- no teal.

Lovely color, however the quality was lacking. I called to express my disappointment in the quality , and because the color was beautiful I would be willing to not to return the rug if it were priced according to quality. I did receive a slight discount, but feel I definitely over payed on this. Not the Home Depot Quality I'm accustomed to.

        it really ties the room together
We were looking for an indoor carpet that would be tough enough and "busy" enough to handle sliding door traffic from the outside. This rug fits that bill perfectly and we are extremely happy with the purchase. It hides dirt and debris well while still looking nice enough to tie the family room together.

        Great colors and quality!
I initially found this 4x6 rug on another site (rhymes which Smoverstock) for about $120, so I was really happy to see it was also sold by Home Depot for about half that much! I couldn't decide between the gray or aqua color choices, so I ordered them both to compare when they arrived. In the end, I decided to keep both gray and aqua rugs because they each looked so great!

The colors depicted in the photos online are pretty true to life. In both gray and aqua rugs, the aqua color is a bit muted -- still a beautiful color without being too loud or garish, which is what I wanted. The yellow color is a lovely gold rather than an ugly mustard -- perfect. And I would say that the blue color is more of a deep royal blue rather than a navy.

The rugs are soft and comfy yet have a short pile, which makes them great for high-traffic areas (I have mine in the entryway). And the pattern and colors do a good job of hiding dirt or possible stains. I would recommend getting some kind of rug grip material to put underneath the rug if you have hardwood or tile, or the rug will slide around. (I bought a Gorilla Grip non-slip rug pad for about $15, and it works great on my hardwood.)

As far as quality, I've had the rug in my entryway for about a month and have noticed zero shedding or any other construction issues, which I was initially worried about since I ordered the rugs online without being able to see them beforehand. Overall, the colors and pattern are beautiful, the rugs look a lot more expensive than they really are, and I've gotten tons of compliments on the one I placed in my entryway.

Not actually used this rug yet since my room is not finished but it feels more soft than other short pile rugs I looked at. It's also been approved by my 2 year old. I wanted a rug that would last with the three boys in my house.

Detectability adjusted count models of songbird abundance [Chapter 6]Product Type: Book, Pages inYear: 2011Author(s): Aldridge, C.L., S. E. Hanser, S.E. Nielsen, M. Leu, B.S. Cade, D.J. Saher, and S.

Occupancy and abundance models were fit for each species using datasets developed at multiple moving window extents to assess landscape-scale relationships between abiotic, habitat, and anthropogenic factors. Anthropogenic factors had less influence on species occupancy or abundance than abiotic and habitat factors...

Shop Adhesive Tapes on Amazon.comAdhesive tape is available in a wide variety of styles, including duct, electrical, painters, packaging, and high temperature tape. Typically adhered to a surface with one or both sides, tapes may be self-adhering, be pressure sensitive, or have an adhesive strip with a removable paper or plastic backing. Self adhesive tape products, usually made from rubber-based materials, cling to themselves and can stretch and seal around objects without an adhesive. Pressure sensitive and adhesive strip tapes, also known as sticky tape, have both a material backing and an adhesive. Double sided adhesive tape includes adhesive on each side of the product for heat transfer, sealing, or shock resistance, among other applications. Backing materials range from polyester and vinyl to cloth and foam. Tape adhesive material also varies, with acrylic and silicone as the most common types. Width and thickness for adhesive tape is usually listed in inches but may be measured in millimeters or mils. Length is typically measured in yards.

Nominal Tape Widths vs Actual Widths







 Tape rolls are cut to standard tape industry metric widths of approx. 24mm per 1-inch of nominal width ordered. As a result ACTUAL tape widths are normally 5% narrower than the NOMINAL width shown in inches. Examples:


1" Nominal width = 15/16" (24mm) Actual width
2" Nominal width = 1-7/8" (48mm) Actual width
3" Nominal width = 2-13/16" (72mm) Actual width


Note that tape rolls are NOT guaranteed to be splice-free.


 Custom Tape WidthsMay be Available!


Need custom sized or "full-cut" width tapes? Many of our tapes come to our converter as full wide width "log rolls" (not pre-cut), and can be custom cut to widths not shown in the pricing table.
Contact us today for pricing and minimum requirements to order your desired tape in a custom width.
Please note that since this tape comes in "log roll" format most rolls ship on a plain white core (i.e. with no branding or text inside the core).












Product Description
Patco 5075 Wire Harness Attachment Tape is a tape used for wire harness attachment to headliners, flooring, and other surfaces in automotive, marine, recreational equipment, construction, and more. For permanent surface attachments. Creates an anti-squeak, anti-itch headliner barrier. The tape is conformable for curves and irregular surfaces and is a low weight, cost effective alternative to foil. Patco 5075 creates an aggressive and permanent locking bond to fabric surfaces. Excellent longevity and high and low temperature performance. Die cuttable. Patco 5075 has higher adhesion then Patco 5095, yet Patco 5095 is thicker and has higher tensile strength.

Please contact us to inquire about pricing for full-cut widths (e.g. a 6 inch roll cut to exactly 152mm instead of 144mm).

hot melt rubber (synthetic)
Offers the widest range of application flexibility available. Exhibits excellent processing performance whether manually or automatically applied. Has superior tensile strength, adhesion properties and holding force which ensures consistent, reliable seals. Hot melt adhesive will bond faster to a surface which is referred to as quick-grab or quick-stick. It typically has higher tack (will feel stickier to the touch), but is also softer. It has lower heat resistance, shear resistance, and sometimes UV resistance than an acrylic adhesive. NOTE: it is called hot melt because the adhesive is applied hot by the manufacturer and then hardens as it cools (you do not need to apply heat to the tape yourself).
natural rubber
Properties are similar to that of hot melt rubber, but natural rubber often holds where other adhesives won't (recycled fibers, dust, cold, heat and heavy loads). It provides good overall adhesion and moisture resistance.
acrylic
Offer excellent performance, especially for applications in temperatures less than 40°F and greater then 120°F. It provides excellent clarity, has high shear strength, is usually more permanent/durable even when exposed to moisture, and it ages well over extended periods in fluorescent and sunlight. Since it remains clear for the life of the application and does not yellow over time it is ideal for applications such as sealing white cartons. While it has good initial adhesion it does take 24-48 hours to cure and to achieve its maximum bond strength (has gradual adhesion buildup). Another difference between hot melt rubber and acrylic adhesive is if you fold tape over making the two adhesive sides touch the acrylic adhesive will remain attached to the carrier (e.g. paper, film) while a hot melt adhesive will stick to itself and pull off of the carrier. It is the best choice for clarity, UV resistance and aging characteristics.
silicone
Is great for extreme temperature applications since silicone adhesive can work in continuous operating temperatures from -100°F to 500°F. They also exhibit good chemical resistance, retain electrical properties, and remove cleanly with little or no residue.
zinc oxide
Zinc oxide based adhesive formula is a skin-friendly adhesive which is commonly used on sports medicine tapes.


Thickness, AKA caliper or gauge, refers to the distance from one surface of a tape backing, or adhesive, to the other.
1 mil = 1/1000 of an inch
Examples: 1/16 inch = 62.5 mils; 1/32 inch = 31.25 mils

       Description    The Monkey Mat is a clean, portable, water-repellent "floor" you can take everywhere!  This 5' x 5' ripstop nylon mat is perfect for use indoors or outdoors: under your crates or an ex-pen at agility trials, picnics, concerts, beach, travel, sporting events, outdoor festivals, kids, and more!  The Monkey Mat is ultra compact and fits inside of a 5.5" x 5.5" zippered pouch. The pouch is actually attached to the mat so that you can't lose track of it. And there's a buckle attachment for the pouch so you can easily latch your folded up Monkey Mat onto a bag, backpack, crate, etc. This mat is lightweight—only 12 oz.—so it really can go everywhere. The ripstop nylon is durable, but still soft to the touch so there's no "plasticky" feel. It's also water repellant so that spills, grass, sand, dirt, etc. shake right off. There are sewn-in corner weights to keep the Monkey Mat from blowing away in the wind as well as corner loops which you can use to stake down the mat (stakes sold separately) or tie multiple Monkey Mats together for an even bigger clean floor. In the center of the mat there are loops to which you can attach keys or other items that you need to keep track of. Machine washable.

The free shipping offer only applies to products that are shipped directly from Clean Run and that do not have a notation in the product description indicating the item is excluded from free shipping offers. Items in the store may be excluded because of weight, box size, or because they must be shipped separately from a different location. In these cases, there is not only a special shipping note in the product description, a green information icon  will appear next to that item in your shopping cart to indicate that shipping will be charged for this particular item, regardless of the order total.


The cost of any item excluded from free shipping is not applied toward the $100 minimum required for free shipping. If the other items in your shopping cart total over $100, however, then you will receive free shipping for those items. The yellow box at the bottom of the shopping cart that tells you how far away you are from free shipping automatically excludes ineligible items and reflects whether the rest of your order is eligible for free shipping, or how much more you need to spend to get free shipping for the rest of the order. If that box says you are eligible for free shipping, then the shipping charges that appear at checkout are only for the product that is excluded from free shipping.


The shipping address must be in the contiguous 48 United States. Hawaii, Alaska, and the following USA military posts and territories are excluded: AA, AE, AP, AS, GU, PW, PR, VI.


Your order must total $100 or more before taxes (Mass. residents only) and after any discounts or promotional codes are applied. This means that if you buy a product that's on sale for 30% off, for example, the discounted price of the product will be used for calculating free shipping, not the original price of the product.


Charges related to shipping will not be included to meet the $100 minimum.


If you have an item in your cart that always qualifies for free USA shipping no matter what the order total (such as shoes) plus other products, the shopping cart will apply the price of the shoes toward the free shipping offer for the other items in the cart. However, if your order does not go over $100, the weight of the shoes will not be included when calculating shipping charges; you will only pay shipping for the other items in your shopping cart.


We will ship your order using the ground delivery service of our choice. If you select a method that is not marked "free," your order does not qualify for free shipping. You will be charged the shipping price displayed in the shopping cart.


You must tell 5 people about our website and how great our products and customer service are—OK, so this isn't really an official requirement, but we would appreciate it if you told your friends!




×
   This product must be special ordered from the manufacturer so it will be shipped separately from any other products that you order from the store. When you check out, the shopping cart will display the method by which this item will be shipped—you cannot select a different method. The cart will also display the shipping charges, if any, for this item.
If you have also ordered products that will ship directly from the Clean Run warehouse, then you will be prompted at checkout to select a method for shipping those items. 
Because this is a special order item, please be aware that we will process your payment immediately (as opposed to when an order ships).



×
  If you live in the continental USA, you will not be charged any shipping for this item when you checkout. (Hawaii, Alaska, and the following USA military posts and territories are excluded: AA, AE, AP, AS, GU, PW, PR, VI.)
Please note that this free shipping offer applies only to this product, NOT to your entire order. If your order includes other items from the store that are not marked as having free shipping, you will be shown shipping charges for just those items when you check out—the weight of the item that qualifies for free shipping is not included in those shipping calculations.

   This item is excluded from our $100 free shipping offer because of its weight or box size, or because it must be shipped separately from a different location. Shipping will be charged for this particular item, regardless of your order total.
The cost of any item excluded from free shipping is not applied toward the $100 minimum required for free shipping. If the other items in your shopping cart total over $100, however, then you will receive free shipping for those items.

×
 Because of its size or weight, or because it is an aerosol product whose contents are under pressure, this product can only be shipped in the USA via UPS Ground service. Sorry, no air shipping. This item cannot be sent to Alaska, Hawaii, APO, FPO, or international addresses.
