Our most important battles are not always with the 'giants out there' those external challenges which we all face. The greatest battles are often within ourselves. Too often, we diminish our own potential in ministry, business, and in life. Shane Stanford and R. Brad Martin frame their powerful book on one of the most well-known and well-loved stories in history: David and Goliath. We all feel like the seemingly powerless, scrawny boy David sometimes. And we all must face giants those challenges that threaten to overwhelm us in ministry, work-life, and in our personal lives. Five Stones is a series of clear and compelling lessons. Each lesson arms the reader with practical and powerful tools of self-discovery, so that the reader s own liabilities, opportunities, convictions, and capabilities are revealed. Like modern-day Davids, readers will leave this book empowered to conquer challenges, in ministry and in life, with clear-eyed confidence and well-grounded hope.

 R. Brad Martin 1951— Biography



      R. Brad Martin
      
      1951–
    











        Chairman and chief executive officer, Saks Incorporated
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: 1951.
    

      Education: University of Memphis, BA, 1976; Owen Graduate School of
      Management, Vanderbilt University, MBA, 1980.
    

      Career: Proffitt's (later became Saks), 1989–, chairman,
      president, and general-merchandise manager; chief executive officer.
    

      Address: Saks Incorporated, 750 Lakeshore Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama
      35211; http://www.saksincorporated.com.
    

      ■ R. Brad Martin was best known for his leadership of Saks Fifth
      Avenue, the beleaguered luxury retailer. The chairman and chief executive
      officer of Saks Incorporated, he struggled to keep Saks Fifth Avenue
      afloat amid low sales, industry criticism, and uncertain chain identity.
    

      The parent company's 383 midmarket regional stores operated under
      the names Proffitt's, McRae's, Younkers, Parisian,
      Herberger's, Carson Pirie Scott, Boston Store, Bergner's,
      and Saks Off 5th, along with a mail-order business, Folio, and the luxury
      chain Saks Fifth Avenue. Saks Incorporated was listed on the New York
      Stock Exchange with a market value over $4 billion. In 2004 the company
      had 55,000 employees, $5.9 billion in revenues, and the number of
      department stores had decreased to 240.
    

      FROM SOUTHERN LEGISLATOR TO DEPARTMENT STORE MAGNATE
    

      Martin spent the 1970s and 1980s as a Tennessee state representative, and
      he also made a fortune in real estate. He then decided to try his hand in
      the retail sector. Martin was the principal investor in the group that
      acquired Proffitt's in 1984. At that time the company operated five
      department stores in metropolitan Knoxville, Tennessee, with annual
      revenues of approximately $40 million. When Martin joined the
      company's management in 1989, Proffitt's was a $75-million
      company.
    

      Martin applied his political wheeling and dealing skills to the boardroom.
      
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       called him a "savvy dealmaker with a thirst for
      acquisitions" (July 3, 2000). He first made his mark in regional
      midmarket stores and purchased Carson Pirie Scott, Herberger's, and
      Parisian. In 1998 he acquired the troubled Saks Fifth Avenue chain for
      $2.1 billion, adding around 360 stores in 39 states to his corporation. At
      the time, Saks was the fourth-largest department store in the United
      States, with annual revenues over $6 billion. The purchase moved him into
      the ranks of luxury retailers. 
      
        Forbes
      
       called Martin "a numbers guy with a knack for consolidation and
      cost-cutting [and] just-folks southern manners" (January 21, 2002).
    

      THE FUR COAT'S NOT-SO-SILVER LINING
    

      Martin's success in the midmarket department stores did not
      transfer to Saks Fifth Avenue, his supposed cash cow. Neiman Marcus and
      Kohl's were formidable rivals to Saks Fifth Avenue, and the new
      chain struggled for a couple years while sales continued to fall. To boost
      sales Martin introduced new clothing lines and promoted in-house expert
      Christina Johnson to chief executive of the chain. He also consolidated
      operations such as credit-card processing, legal services, and logistics.
      To motivate company buyers, he created a new compensation and bonus plan
      tied to performance. Construction costs for new stores were also cut.
    

      Martin tried to create a cozier feel in the revamped stores with coffee
      shops and more colorful decor and by adding a less-pricey clothing line.
      His take on luxury was unique: "Luxury does not need to be
      exclusive or aloof, or, could we say, snooty" (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , September 9, 2002). To appeal to more customers, Martin invested $30
      million in an e-commerce site to increase traffic to the store and provide
      more products to current customers. He spent tens of millions of dollars
      on the Web site, which generated at most $25 million a year in income.
      Martin pushed forward despite negative results, firing many Saks veterans
      in the process. In 2003 he began to add youthful, more stylish shoes and
      jeans to attract teens and younger women. In January 2002 
      
        Forbes
      
       accused
       Martin of "mixing mass with class" and "suffering
      from an identity crisis" because of its mix of teen styles with
      pricey adult items (January 21, 2002).
    

      By 2002 Martin's luxury purchase was still afflicted by recession,
      increased competition, and $1.3 billion in debt. Though this caused him to
      sharply scale back on planned expansion, between 1998 and 2002 Martin
      opened 14 new Saks Fifth Avenue stores, expanded 12 more, and closed four.
      In July 2002 he was forced to sell the Saks credit-card operation to
      Household International. Saks Fifth Avenue was hard-hit by the drop in
      tourism to New York City following the terrorist attacks on the World
      Trade Center in 2001.
    

      Martin told 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       that "It's taken longer to get to where I wanted, but
      I'm pleased with our progress" (July 3, 2000). But analysts
      commented that the company had spread itself too thinly with its new
      acquisition, and that marketing and the Saks image needed work. The
      company appealed mainly to older, wealthy shoppers and failed to
      incorporate differences in regional tastes. Martin tried opening stores in
      second-tier markets and adding moderately priced store brands. To assist
      him, Johnson accounted for the chain's problems when she trained
      her buyers and looked at contemporary clothing lines for the new stores.
    

      Saks Incorporated made a small profit in 2002 and then lost $45.8 million
      in the first half of 2003. Wall Street pressured Martin to sell off the
      sickly Saks Fifth Avenue, to which he responded, "Ain't
      gonna happen" (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , September 9, 2002). In 2003 he brought in a former Bristol-Myers Squibb
      president to streamline the organization, create management teams, and
      increase communication among groups within the corporation. Only two new
      stores were planned through 2005.

Recognize who you are, claim the capabilities you already have, and learn to stand up to the challenges that sometimes overwhelm you—even when you yourself are the challenge!Our most important battles are not always with the "giants out there"—those external challenges which we all face. The greatest battles are sometimes within ourselves. Too often, we diminish our own potential in ministry, business, and in life. Learn to battle the giants in your life, in a series of lessons based on the story of David and Goliath. Includes a personal training manual to help you practice what you’ve learned.
Shane Stanford and R. Brad Martin frame their powerful book on one of the most well-known and well-loved stories in history: David and Goliath. We all feel like the seemingly powerless, scrawny boy David sometimes. And we all must face “giants”—those challenges that threaten to overwhelm us in ministry, work-life, and in our personal lives.
Five Stones is a series of clear and compelling lessons. Each lesson arms the reader with practical and powerful tools of self-discovery, so that the reader’s own liabilities, opportunities, convictions, and capabilities are revealed. Like modern-day Davids, readers will leave this book empowered to conquer challenges, in ministry and in life, with clear-eyed confidence and well-grounded hope.

"This is not just a leadership book. Certainly, It is that in an excellent way, but it is also far more. It is a book for everyone who needs help living in the daily grind. Both authors are personal friends who have contributed immensely to my own five smooth stones of life. This is not theoretical as is too much we are given to read. No abstractions here. The message of the Five Stones has been lived. What a delight it is to receive the same powerful guidance from a preacher and a layman!
