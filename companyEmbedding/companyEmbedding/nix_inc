Biofilm: a critical problem


Biofilm is a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances excreted by microorganisms. That’s why bacteria encased in biofilm are so difficult to remove from pipes, tubing and water processing equipment. 


Improperly sanitized piping and equipment can lead to serious health issues. Water and airborne bacteria have been responsible for infections, fever, and the spread of diseases in many public, industrial and medical facilities.    


Biofilm is difficult to remove







NIX Biofilm Dispersant requires no special handling 





NIX, Inc. produces an exclusive biofilm dispersant for aqueous media…plus other water treatment solutions







The NIX one-two punch





NIX Biofilm Dispersant provides pathways for disinfectants to reach the bacteria. This one-two punch provides the most reliable method available today for eliminating bacteria in piping and equipment.

NIX Cooling Tower Filter


When combined with traditional disinfectants, NIX Biofilm Dispersant provides the most reliable process currently available for disinfecting piping and equipment. 


NIX Products


NIX cooling tower filters provide three critical advantages: 1) Increased control of disease-producing bacteria that can form on water-borne particulates. 2) Reduced corrosion build-up. 3) Improved cooling tower efficiency by removing fine particulate that reduces heat transfer.
