White Pine Capital




























































Helping Institutions and Individuals Achieve Their Financial Goals




Home
White Pine Capital has provided independent investment advice since 1984. Our team of investment professionals has successfully navigated clients through a variety of market environments, cycles, and conditions.



















The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.The second best time is now.












Institutional Investors



For over thirty years White Pine Capital has constructed separately managed accounts for Taft-Hartley, Endowments, Foundations, Partnerships, and Family Offices. Consistent portfolio management leadership and an experienced investment team have successfully managed portfolios through a variety of market environments and conditions.








Individual Investors



Since 1984, White Pine Capital has provided customized Wealth Management Solutions for individuals using a disciplined, time tested methodology. Our Portfolio Managers provide a personalized approach, with impartial balanced advice, as they guide our clients along their path of economic independence.






About White Pine Capital



White Pine Capital has provided independent investment advice since 1984. Our team of investment professionals has successfully navigated clients through a variety of market environments, cycles, and conditions. Each client is guided by a Portfolio Manager who is the actual investment manager for their assets and our flexible platform interfaces with over twenty different custodians. The White Pine Capital philosophy aligns its interests with the interests of our clients. 






Why the Name White Pine?



The White Pine (Pinus Strobus) is a native tree to Minnesota and serves as a symbol of what we are about. Officially known as the Eastern White Pine, the trees have a vigorous growth rate and the high quality wood make it a preferred choice for lumber. Sometimes called the monarch of the forest, tree trunks can reach six feet in diameter, and soar to a height of over 250 feet. In the pioneer days, tree trunks from White Pines harvested in the eastern part of the U.S. were the preferred choice for the masts of the majestic sailing ships due to their tall, straight and strong trunks. The trees were heavily logged in the early years of Minnesota's development, and recently the DNR has begun a major replanting program for White Pines. Like investments, "The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now."

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

All Cap Equity — White Pine Capital


















































Helping Institutions and Individuals Achieve Their Financial Goals




All Cap Equity























All Capitalization Equity Universe: Our investment universe spans a broad range of market capitalization growth oriented companies, generally with market capitalizations greater than $500 million, allowing for greater exposure to the wealth creating effects of the broader economy and market. Importantly, the inclusion of medium and smaller capitalization companies improves the overall Growth vs. Value and Return vs. Risk profile of the portfolio. Active management of the mix between large, medium and smaller companies provides dynamic opportunities to take advantage of differing expected returns across market capitalization segments.Return Profile: Our fundamentally-based, time-tested investment process has generated favorable risk adjusted returns over a variety of market cycles and environments. Our investment process and framework focuses on Growth vs. Value and Return vs. Risk characteristics providing the highest probability of performance success while managing capital risk. Historically we have performed relatively well when market returns are broad and inclusive. This typically occurs when risk premiums are stable to declining and yield spreads are narrowing. In addition, because our research efforts focus on solid balance sheets and the establishment of an attractive investment basis, we tend to outperform during market declines.Our process tends to be less effective when risk premiums widen or in extreme markets when momentum or high growth stocks are in favor.    As a result, our process tends to protect capital in down markets and provide good participation in up markets, which over the cycle, has generated favorable risk adjusted returns.Investment Process: Growing companies create wealth. Revenues and earnings growth are important drivers of stock prices and solid foundations provide the highest probability of longer term, sustainable growth and appreciation. Diversified portfolios are built from our process that includes thorough analysis of the income statement as well as the balance sheet, cash flows and capital structure to ensure the company has a solid base from which it can grow.  Investment basis drives return profile. Larger stocks have a value tilt as they tend to be more efficiently priced. Smaller stocks have a growth tilt as they tend to be less efficiently priced offering opportunities to purchase growth at attractive valuations. Overall, the portfolio has favorable Growth vs. Value and Return vs. Risk characteristics.CONTACT US FOR MORE INFORMATION >>
