President & CEO, Accuride Corporation

Richard F. (Rick) Dauch joined Accuride Corporation in February 2011 as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors.
Prior to joining Accuride, Mr. Dauch served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Acument Global Technologies.

During complementary corporate and military careers, Dauch has amassed 25 years of cumulative leadership experience. He has cultivated management and leadership skills across a broad range of disciplines, including operations, sales and marketing, labor relations, strategic planning, finance, and investor relations.
Prior to his service at Acument, Dauch served in varied capacities during a 13-year tenure with American Axle and Manufacturing, Inc.

Prior to AAM, Dauch worked at the United Technologies Carrier Division, where he led the specialty packaged products business consisting of unique product lines produced in Korea, Italy, Mexico, Brazil, and in several plants across the USA. Prior to that assignment he was both the materials and manufacturing manager of the small packaged products business unit in Tyler, Texas.
Dauch’s corporate career was preceded by his service as an officer in the U.S. Army beginning in 1983, concluding with his assignment as a Light Infantry Company Commander with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, NY. Dauch was also qualified as an Airborne-Ranger and expert infantryman.

Background[edit]
Dauch was born in Norwalk, Ohio in 1942[1] to W.G. Albert and Helen Dauch, the youngest of their seven children. After high school, he attended Purdue University, where he played football before graduating in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Management and Science.[2] He married Sandy Rule in 1960, and they have four children.[3]
Dauch contributed $3 million to an 67,000-square-foot (6,200 m2) alumni center at Purdue University[3] and served as chair for the 2006 United Way torch drive.[4]
General Motors, Volkswagen and Chrysler[edit]
Dauch joined General Motors as a college graduate-in-training assigned to the Chevrolet Motor Division's Flint, Michigan car and truck assembly plant. By 1973, at the age of 30, he was named the youngest plant manager in the history of the Chevrolet Motor Division. After a stint as Assistant Sales Manager in the Chevrolet Detroit Zone, he was appointed Plant Manager Chevrolet Gear and Axle (one of the five plants he later acquired to co-found American Axle and Manufacturing). In 1976, Dauch became Vice President of Manufacturing for Volkswagen Manufacturing of America, where he managed the manufacturing facilities (Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly), the first volume automotive transplant in the United States.[5]
Dauch joined Chrysler in April 1980, as Vice President of Diversified operations, where he helped re-engineer their manufacturing systems, establishing just-in-time material management systems and the three shift manufacturing vehicle assembly process. Dauch retired from Chrysler in 1991 as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Manufacturing.[6]
American Axle and Manufacturing[edit]
In 1993, Dauch headed an investment group that acquired five General Motors parts plants in Michigan and New York to form American Axle and Manufacturing. It became a stand-alone tier one automotive supplier on March 1, 1994.[6] American Axle has become a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, and has grown from its original five plants to 35 locations worldwide.[6]
American Drive[edit]
Dauch has written a book about his experiences called American Drive: How Manufacturing Will Save Our Country , written with co-author Hank H. Cox. The book was published in September 2012.[7] The book narrates the story of AAM against the backdrop of nearly fifty years in the auto industry, from America's glory days to its massive decline in the face of foreign competition, the government bailouts, battles with unions, and the recent financial crisis.
Death[edit]
Dauch died on August 2, 2013 of cancer in his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan according to the Oakland County medical examiner's office.[8] American Axle said in a statement, "Our thoughts and prayers are with Dick’s family and friends. All of us have lost a great friend and leader."[8]

In 1976, Dauch became Vice President of Manufacturing for Volkswagen Manufacturing of America, where he managed the manufacturing facilities (Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly), the first volume automotive transplant in the United States.[5]
Dauch joined Chrysler in April 1980, as Vice President of Diversified operations, where he helped re-engineer their manufacturing systems, establishing just-in-time material management systems and the three shift manufacturing vehicle assembly process. Dauch retired from Chrysler in 1991 as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Manufacturing.[6]
American Axle and Manufacturing[edit]
In 1993, Dauch headed an investment group that acquired five General Motors parts plants in Michigan and New York to form American Axle and Manufacturing. It became a stand-alone tier one automotive supplier on March 1, 1994.[6] American Axle has become a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, and has grown from its original five plants to 35 locations worldwide.[6]
American Drive[edit]
Dauch has written a book about his experiences called American Drive: How Manufacturing Will Save Our Country , written with co-author Hank H. Cox. The book was published in September 2012.[7] The book narrates the story of AAM against the backdrop of nearly fifty years in the auto industry, from America's glory days to its massive decline in the face of foreign competition, the government bailouts, battles with unions, and the recent financial crisis.
Death[edit]
Dauch died on August 2, 2013 of cancer in his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan according to the Oakland County medical examiner's office.[8] American Axle said in a statement, "Our thoughts and prayers are with Dick’s family and friends. All of us have lost a great friend and leader."[8]

Rick Dauch Named Accuride Corporation’s President & CEO




Denise Rondini
February 2, 2011














Accuride Corporation announced that Richard F. (Rick) Dauch has been appointed to serve as the company’s president and chief executive officer. Dauch succeeds Bill Lasky who has served as Accuride’s interim president and chief executive officer since September 2008. Lasky has also served as chairman of the board since January 2009 and will continue in that role.
“I have enjoyed serving as interim president and CEO and working closely with Accuride’s strong management team throughout this very challenging economic cycle. I am equally looking forward to supporting Rick and the Company as I continue in my role as chairman,” says Lasky. “Rick brings us extensive experience leading complex, global businesses, an indepth understanding of manufacturing and supply chain systems, and proven leadership skills. These make him highly qualified to lead Accuride into the upturn in the commercial vehicle industry, successfully taking us to the next level of performance and delivering exceptional results for all of our stakeholders.”
“Accuride is a financially solid company with market leading brands, a loyal customer base, and a strong foundation of world-class product and process technology. I am excited to join the Accuride team and look forward to developing and executing a plan to selectively and profitably grow the Company,” says Dauch.



Dauch joins Accuride from Michigan-based Acument Global Technologies, an industry leader in mechanical fastening systems, where he had served as president and CEO since June 2008. Dauch led an extensive restructuring of Acument, divesting non-strategic and under-performing operations, and virtually eliminating its debt, while simultaneously making critical investments and implementing LEAN systems across the remaining business units.
Under his leadership, Acument emerged from the recent global recession financially and competitively strengthened.
Prior to joining Acument, Dauch served as executive vice president of Worldwide Manufacturing for American Axle & Manufacturing (AAM), Inc., where he was responsible for the daily operations of 17 global manufacturing facilities and 10,000 employees. In addition to serving as president of the Metal Formed Division, Dauch held a number of leadership roles within AAM during his 13-year tenure with the company, including director of strategic planning, vice president of sales and marketing, and vice president of investor relations and financial planning. Prior to AAM, Dauch led the specialty packaged products business of United Technologies’ Carrier Division.
Dauch’s corporate career was preceded by his service as an officer in the United States Army, including qualification as an Airborne Ranger and concluding with his assignment as a Light Infantry Company Commander in the 10th Mountain Division.

Richard Dauch: 1942-2013 










August 5, 2013




 

Richard Dauch: 1942-2013

Richard E. Dauch, 71, co-founder and executive chairman of American Axle & Manufacturing, passed away at his home on August 2, 2013. Loving husband of Sandra for 53 years and dear father of Richard F. (Connie),  David C. (Anita),  Teri Dauch Gigot (Timothy) and Jane Dauch Harvey. He was the proud grandfather of Katie (Sean), Jacqueline, Amy (Omar), Andy (Charlotte), Madison, David Christian (Lauren), Rachael, Zachary, Lucas, Charles, Lindsay, Matthew, Nicholas, Brooke, Savanah and Jake and great grandfather of Lillian and Charlie. He considered his loving family to be the true “moments of his life.”Born in Norwalk, Ohio on July 23, 1942 to W.G. Albert and Helen Dauch who preceded him in death. Survived by his siblings, Gale (Dee), Nancy, William (Mona), Jack (Lee), David (Carol) and his foster brother George Knittle (Mary Lou). Also his late brother-in-law Barton.Dauch graduated from Ashland High School in Ashland, Ohio in 1960. He earned All-Ohio honors in football and became a proud Purdue Boilermaker when he received a scholarship to play football earning several varsity letters. He received his bachelor of science degree in Industrial Management in 1964. Upon his college graduation, he started his career in the auto industry joining General Motors at their Chevrolet Flint Assembly plant where he went through management training and various plant supervisory positions. In 1973, he became the plant manager at the Chevrolet Spring & Bumper plant in Livonia, making him at age 30, the youngest plant manager in GM’s history at that time. His next assignment was in the Detroit Zone Sales operations for a year. His final assignment for GM was as plant manager of the Detroit Gear & Axle Manufacturing Complex.He left GM in 1976 to join Volkswagen of America to become their vice-president and general manufacturing manager, later being promoted to group vice-president and board of directors member in recognition of his immense influence on VW’s successful launching of Volkswagen production in America.In 1980 he joined Chrysler Corporation where he was able to lead manufacturing initiatives to improve quality, production and labor. His key innovations were three shift assembly, just in time materials management and sequential production. “Dick was practicing lean manufacturing and leading the quality revolution years before those terms became part of the business conversation,” said former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca. “He put his heart and soul into the auto industry, and the success of AAM is proof of this dedication”.Dauch was the co-founder of American Axle & Manufacturing (AAM) in March 1994. He served as chairman of the board from 1997 until his passing. Most recently he served as executive chairman of the board. He also served as chief executive officer from 1994 to 2012 and was president of AAM from March 1994 to December 2000. He was known for his distinctive, direct, get-it-done style of management that helped AAM become one of the top automotive suppliers in the world and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, AXL.Former Michigan Governor John Engler worked closely with him through the years. He remembers, “Dick’s vision became reality. Failing plants became profitable, a blighted area of urban Detroit became an oasis and AAM produced products that succeeded globally, Dick Dauch showed us how that vision can be replicated nationally and internationally applying the lesson of Detroit and Axle, leadership and team building, quality and innovation to U.S. Manufacturing and our nation’s economy.”He was the recipient of numerous honors during his career. He received the 2006 Shien-Ming Wu Foundation Manufacturing Leadership Award; the 2005 CEO Legend Award from Automation Alley; the 2003 Harvard Business School of Michigan Business Statesman; the 2002 Wayne State University, College of Business Administrations Michigan Executive of the Year and the Detroit Regional Chamber’s World Leader of the Year. Dauch was also named Detroit News Michiganian of the Year (1999), Crains Detroit Business Newsmaker of the Year (1997), Michigan Manufacturers Association “Manufacturer of the Year” (1997) and the Automotive Hall of Fame Industry Leader of the Year (1996) and he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor (1997).Dauch’s reputation as an innovative manufacturing strategist and entrepreneur is widely recognized in North America and around the world. In addition to lecturing extensively on the subject of world-class manufacturing, he authored two books, Passion for Manufacturing and American Drive which was released in 2012.Dauch sat on the board of directors of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and served as chairman of the Manufacturing Institute. He is a past member of the board of directors of Detroit Renaissance and the board of the Detroit Economic Club. In 2006 Dauch served as the general chair of the United Way for Southeast Michigan’s Torch Drive campaign. He was past chairman of the board of directors of the Detroit Regional Chamber. He was very involved in the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan, and the Boy Scouts of America-Detroit Area Council, which presented him with its “Man and Boy Award” in 1990. In 2012 Dauch was honored with the Distinguished Citizen Award, and was also presented with six merit badges reflecting his involvement in athletics, his citizenship and his career in the automotive industry.A big supporter of education, he was instrumental in creating manufacturing and management curricula at several universities, including Purdue University, Lehigh University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Management from Purdue University, an Honorary Doctorate of Law from Ashland University (Ohio), and an Honorary Doctor of Commercial Science from Central Michigan University.Generous donations from the Dauch family helped create the Richard E. and Sandra J. Dauch College of Business and Economics at Ashland University; the Dauch Center for Management of Manufacturing Enterprises at Purdue University and the Dick and Sandy Dauch Alumni Center also at Purdue. In addition, the Dauchs partnered with the NFL to establish the NFL/YET Boys & Girls Club at the Dick & Sandy Dauch Campus in Detroit, Michigan. They also collaborated with the Boy Scouts of America to establish the Dauch Scout Center in Detroit.Unafraid of controversy or hardship throughout his career, Dauch did whatever it took to get the job done. In his book American Drive, Dauch declared, “I hope to live long enough to see one or more U.S. auto companies listed again among the Dow Jones 30. But even if I don’t, I do believe U.S. manufacturing will continue to grow and prosper and lead our country back to a solid economic footing. It is already happening. We have only begun to show what we can do. Manufacturers in the U.S.A. have accepted the challenge of world competition and are poised for great things in the years ahead. I am fiercely proud of the creation, success, and sustainability of AAM based in Detroit, Michigan. We are one of America’s premier global automotive manufacturers. We have done it against all odds. It has been greatly fulfilling.”Family will receive friends Monday, August 5, and Tuesday, August 6, 3:00pm-8:00pm at A.J. Desmond & Sons (Vasu, Rodgers & Connell Chapel), 32515 Woodward (between 13-14 Mile), Royal Oak. Funeral service will be held on Wednesday, August 7, 11:00am at First United Methodist Church, 1589 W. Maple Rd., Birmingham, MI, with a visitation preceding the service beginning at 10:00am. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial tributes to: “Richard E. Dauch Memorial Fund” to support research and education in the fight against pancreatic cancer, Beaumont Foundation, P.O. Box 5802, Troy, MI 48007-9620, or Hospice of Michigan, 400 Mack Avenue, Detroit, MI 48201. For more information:
