MESSAGE FROM ROGER TOMPKINS 

I am proud to announce our first annual report and the first anniversary of our 
Variable Universal Life and Variable Deferred Annuity products. In our 70th year
of business, the State Farm Life Insurance Companies retain the same strong     
conviction that we started with back in 1929 -- a conviction to help our        
customers protect themselves from an uncertain future.                          

                                                                         [PHOTO]

Our financial strength and claims-paying ability remains strong and we continue 
to receive the highest ratings from major agencies like Moody's, Standard &     
Poor's and A.M. Best. These high ratings tell you that the company has the      
financial strength to provide the benefits promised by each of our policies.    
1998 was an excellent year for the State Farm Life Insurance Companies. We saw  
an increase in sales, in part due to the launch of our Variable                 

Products. In addition, we've talked with many of you about what products and    
services you would like to see from us in the future. You can expect to see some
innovations and new products from State Farm in the next few years, both to keep
us current with the latest technology as well as to bring you the products and  
services you've voiced an interest in.                                          

As you read this report, keep in mind the important features and benefits of    
your policy. For example, our Variable Universal Life product combines the      
security of life insurance with the opportunity to invest the policy account    
value in the underlying investment options described in this report. It offers  
the benefit of financial protection for your beneficiaries against your         
premature death. On the other hand, our Variable Deferred Annuity allows you to 
apply account value to payout options that can provide guaranteed income for as 
long as you live and provides a death benefit if you die before annuitization.  

We hope you continue to meet regularly with your agent to review your financial 
situation and your personal goals, as well as stay in touch with the innovations
and new products we plan to offer. Regular meetings with your agent can help you
periodically check on your changing needs as you provide for the security and   
protection of your family.                                                      

We appreciate the confidence you've shown in State Farm and in our life         
insurance products. We hope our high quality products, great service and        
prudently managed investment portfolios continue to meet your needs for many    
years to come.                                                                  

Sincerely,                                                                      

/s/ Roger Tompkins

MESSAGE TO VARIABLE PRODUCT CUSTOMERS                                           
[PHOTO]                                                                         

Financial markets generally provided investors with very good returns in 1998,  
but it was necessary to endure the volatility that occurred in late summer and  
early fall to reap the rewards. Over the course of the year, investments in     
diversified portfolios of U.S. and European large company common stocks and good
quality bonds generally did well. Investments in small company common stocks,   
emerging market stocks and bonds, and low quality bonds generally experienced   
lower or negative returns.                                                      

The backdrop of decent growth in corporate profits and the general economy; low 
inflation; accommodating monetary policy; and interest rates moving to low      
levels ultimately gave investors the confidence to bid up the values of good    
quality investments in 1998. Prices of many financial assets now stand at the   
high end of historical valuation levels. In order for these levels to be        
maintained and move higher over the short-term, the favorable conditions        
mentioned earlier probably need to persist. From a long-term perspective, we    
have found that investments in portfolios of securities similar to those owned  
by the Funds covered in this report tend to achieve returns that are competitive
with alternative investments which possess similar risks.                       

The following table presents total return information for the State Farm        
Variable Deferred Annuity and the State Farm Variable Universal Life insurance  
product. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. INVESTMENT   
RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT YOUR SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED,   
MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

As we present this first annual report covering the Funds to you, I cannot      
resist imparting a bit of philosophy which is deeply seeded in our investment   
activities at State Farm. Uncertainty always exists in all aspects of life,     
including investments in financial markets. Investors can cope with the         
uncertainties of financial markets by viewing their investments in the suitable 
Funds as long-term investments and regularly making periodic investments in the 
Funds' shares. Funds should be selected to match an investor's long-term        
investment objectives and tolerances for risk. We encourage investors to be     
patient and to be prepared to ride out market fluctuations, large and small,    
which will inevitably occur. In our opinion, the primary challenge for any      
investor is development of a long-term investment program which makes one       
comfortable regardless of what short-term direction markets take. This long-term
approach is particularly appropriate since the variable products involve fees   
and charges which are described in the prospectus.                              

I have included a discussion on the U.S. Economy, U.S. Equity Market, U.S. Bond 
Market and International Economies and Markets on pages 3 and 4.                

/s/ Kurt R. Moser                                                               

------------------------                                                        

(1)The State Farm Variable Deferred Annuity product total returns reflect all   
contract-level and underlying fund fees and expenses, including the imposition  
of the maximum surrender charge of 7% where indicated. The fees and expenses are
based on an assumed average account size of $5,600. The total return period     
begins on the Fund inception date (as noted) and ends on December 31, 1998.     
These total returns apply only to the State Farm Life Insurance Company product 
and not to the State Farm Life and Accident Assurance Company product. The State
Farm Life and Accident Assurance Company does not yet have sufficient           
performance history to calculate total returns.                                 

(2)The State Farm Variable Universal Life product total returns reflect all     
contract-level and underlying fund fees and expenses, except for surrender      
charges and the cost of insurance. If the cost of insurance were reflected, the 
performance quoted would be significantly lower than shown. Please refer to the 
hypothetical illustrations in the State Farm Variable Universal Life prospectus 
to see how the cost of insurance can impact performance. We encourage you to    
obtain a personalized illustration of historical performance that reflects the  
cost of insurance. The fees and expenses reflected in this calculation are based
on an assumed average account size of $2,500. The total return period begins on 
the product effective registration date of February 11, 1998, and ends December
31, 1998. These total returns apply only to the State Farm Life Insurance       
Company product and not to the State Farm Life and Accident Assurance Company   
product. The State Farm Life and Accident Assurance Company does not yet have   
sufficient performance history to calculate total returns.

THE U.S. ECONOMY                                                                

The U.S. economy remains remarkably robust thanks to strength in consumer       
spending. The strong showing in the consumer sector has been able to offset     
weakness on the manufacturing side where weak export demand and intense overseas
competition have been taking their toll. Our country is in its eighth           
consecutive year of generally good economic times. Consumers continue to be     
willing to spend money for goods and services as they are encouraged by high    
levels of employment and growth in personal income. Low levels of inflation and 
interest rates have combined with good investment returns to further bolster    
consumer confidence.                                                            

Growth in U.S. real gross domestic product for 1998 was 3.9%. For the fourth    
quarter of 1998, growth of the real gross domestic product was a surprisingly   
strong 5.6%. The recent report on fourth quarter economic activity even showed  
some improvement in two of the economy's weak spots-- manufacturing and exports.
However, one probably should not be too eager to proclaim these weak sectors as 
being healthy again. It is fairly apparent that approximately 40% of the world  
economy is either stagnant or in recession, concentrated primarily in Japan and 
the emerging countries. A major worry for the domestic economy is the

Economic growth is represented by the percentage change in Real Gross Domestic  
product. Percentage change in the Consumer Price Index-Urban is used for        
inflation.                                                                      

THE U.S. EQUITY MARKET                                                          

The U.S. stock market in 1998 overcame a decline of approximately 20% in late   
summer and early fall and posted excellent returns for the fourth consecutive   
year. The S&P 500 Index produced a 28.6% total return for the year. This        
four-year streak of returns in excess of 20% for the S&P 500 Index is           
unprecedented in U.S. stock market history. Realistically, returns of this      
magnitude are not sustainable for long periods of time.                         

During 1998 and over the four-year period from 1995-98, returns of the S&P 500  
have been generated by an increasingly narrow group of stocks. Throughout the   
four-year period from 1995-98, more than 50% of the total return of the S&P 500 
Index was produced by only 20 stocks. In 1998, about 50% of the total return of 
the S&P 500 Index was provided by only ten stocks. Furthermore, the 150 largest 
stocks in the S&P 500 increased an average of 28.5% in 1998 compared to a 4.9%  
gain for the 350 smaller stocks which are contained in the Index.               

The differences between returns of small and large company common stocks was    
also obvious in the performance of the Russell 2000 Index, which is made up of  
stocks of smaller companies. The Russell 2000 experienced a 2.6% decline in     
1998.

THE U.S. BOND MARKET                                                            

Investors in good quality bonds also enjoyed a fine year in 1998. Prices of high
quality bonds rose while interest rates trended downward significantly.         
Interestingly, the magnitude of interest rate declines was much less for bonds  
with lower credit ratings. In fact, contrary to the general falling trend in    
interest rates, yields have actually risen on bonds carrying ratings below      
investment grade. These movements display investors' preferences for higher     
quality assets during times when financial markets across the globe are volatile
and the future seems more uncertain.                                            

The Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Intermediate Term Index, which is      
considered representative of the market for high-quality intermediate-term      
bonds, produced a total return of 8.4% in 1998.                                 

Central banks across the developed world eased monetary policy in the second    
half of the year in response to evidence that their economies were slowing. The 
United States Federal Reserve Board was very prominent in this activity. Its    
Open Market Committee cut short-term interest rates by a total of 75 basis      
points through three 25 basis point moves within a seven-week period beginning  
in late September. Current low levels of inflation give the Federal Reserve     
flexibility to do whatever it deems necessary in an attempt to keep our economy 
growing. While long-term market interest rates have followed the direction of   
short-term yields in 1998, that is not always the case. Market interest rates   
are also influenced heavily by expectations for the economy, inflation and      
international capital flows.                                                    

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES AND MARKETS                                             

Virtually all international economies are currently exhibiting economic         
conditions which are much weaker than we are experiencing in the United States. 
Even Europe, which was more or less keeping pace with the United States earlier 
in the year, now is starting to show signs of slower growth. The Asian turmoil  
has subsided, but emerging economies in that region remain quite weak. China is 
showing some economic strains, and Japan continues to muddle along with         
unacceptable general economic results. Currency and economic problems are       
surfacing in Brazil, and some evidence indicates that those difficulties may be 
spreading to the rest of Latin America.                                         

The EAFE-Registered Trademark- Free Index is a broad market index that          
encompasses markets through the developed free world. The Index achieved an     
18.3% return in U.S. dollar terms in 1998. Very strong returns in most European 
markets, which account for 73% of the Index, overcame weakness in Asia and New  
Zealand. The EAFE Index does not include stock markets of countries with        
so-called emerging economies.

The Large Cap Equity Index Fund seeks to match the return of the S&P            
500-Registered Trademark- Index(1), which tracks the common stock performance of
500 large companies in a broad range of industries. The Fund invests in each of 
the stocks in the S&P 500-Registered Trademark- in the same                     
capitalization-weighted proportion that the stock has in the index. For the year
ended December 31, 1998, the Fund benefited from continued strength in the      
equity market, with particularly strong performance from the large companies    
that are included in the S&P 500 Index.

*The S&P 500 Index tracks the common stock performance of large U.S. companies  
in the manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and financial industries. It   
also tracks the performance of common stocks issued by foreign and smaller U.S.

common stocks. Unlike an investment in the Large Cap Equity Index Fund, a

SMALL CAP EQUITY INDEX FUND                                                     

The Small Cap Equity Index Fund seeks to match the return of the Russell        
2000-Registered Trademark- Index(2), which includes 2000 companies with average 
market capitalization of $570 million. This index was created by the Frank      
Russell Trust Company to give investors an idea of how the stocks of the smaller
companies are performing. The Small Cap Equity Index Fund invests in a          
diversified portfolio of common stocks intended to reflect, as a group, the     
total investment return of the Russell 2000-Registered Trademark- Index. Returns
will sometimes vary from the return of the Index because the Fund invests in a  
representative sample of the 2000 stocks in the Index, but not in every stock   
included in the Index.

Unlike an investment in the Bond Fund, a theoretical investment in the Index    
does not reflect any expenses.

Past performance is not predictive of future performance. Investment return and

STOCK AND BOND BALANCED FUND                                                    

The Stock and Bond Balanced Fund seeks long-term growth of capital, balanced    
with current income by investing primarily in shares of the Large Cap Equity    
Index Fund and the Bond Fund. The Balanced Fund usually invests approximately   
60% of its net assets in the Large Cap Equity Index Fund and 40% in the Bond    
Fund.                                                                           

At December 31, 1998, 62% of the Stock and Bond Balanced Fund's assets were     
invested in the Large Cap Equity Index Fund and 38% in the Bond Fund, in line   
with the Fund's stated objectives.

MONEY MARKET FUND                                                               

The Money Market Fund seeks to maximize current income to the extent consistent 
with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity. The Fund pursues 
this objective by investing in high quality commercial paper and other          
short-term debt securities. An investment in the Money Market Fund is not       
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other 
government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your        
investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the 
Fund.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              
SECURITY VALUATION                                                              

Investments are stated at value. Portfolio securities traded on securities      
exchanges, or in the over-the-counter market in which transaction prices are    
reported, are valued at the last sales prices on the day of valuation, or, if   
there are no reported sales on that day, at the last reported bid price for the 
day. Portfolio securities that are primarily traded on foreign securities       
exchanges are generally valued at the preceding closing values of such          
securities on their respective exchanges where primarily traded. Long-term debt 
securities and U.S. Treasury bills are valued using quotations provided by an   
independent pricing service. All of the securities and assets of the Money      
Market Fund and short-term debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days 
or less (other than U.S. Treasury bills) held by any of the other Funds are     
valued on an amortized cost basis, which approximates market value. Investments 
in affiliated investment companies are valued each day based on the closing net 
asset value of the respective fund. Futures contracts are valued at the         
settlement price established each day on the exchange on which they are traded. 
Forward foreign currency contracts are valued daily using quoted forward        
exchange rates. Any securities not valued as described above are valued at fair 
value as determined in good faith by the Board of Trustees or its delegate.     

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME                                   

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date (date the order to buy or 
sell is executed) and dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date,      
except that certain dividends from foreign securities are recorded as soon as   
the information is available to the Funds. Interest income is recorded on the   
accrual basis and includes amortization of discounts on money market instruments
and long-term debt instruments when required for federal income tax purposes.   
Realized gains and losses from security transactions are reported on an         
identified cost basis.                                                          

FUND SHARE VALUATION                                                            

Fund shares are sold and redeemed on a continuous basis at net asset value. Net 
asset value per share is determined daily as of the time of the close of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, (currently 4:00 p.m., New York City time) on    
each day when the New York Stock Exchange is open, other than those days        
specifically stated in the Trust's prospectus, except that a Fund need not      
compute a net asset value on any day                                            

                                                                       55-------

STATE FARM VARIABLE PRODUCT TRUST 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 
when no purchase or redemption order has been received by the Fund. The net     
asset value per share is computed by dividing the total value of the Funds'     
investments and other assets, less liabilities, by the respective number of Fund
shares outstanding.                                                             

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES, DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREOWNERS                

It is the Funds' policy to comply with the special provisions of the Internal   
Revenue Code available to investment companies and, in the manner provided      
therein, to distribute all of its taxable income, as well as any net realized   
gain on sales of investments reportable for federal income tax purposes. The    
Funds intend to comply with this policy and, accordingly, no provision for      
federal income taxes has been made.                                             

Dividends and distributions payable to shareowners are recorded by the Large    
Cap, Small Cap, International, and Balanced Funds on the ex-dividend date. The  
Bond and Money Market Funds declare dividends daily equal to each Fund's        
respective net investment income, and distributions of such amounts are made at 
the end of each calendar quarter. Income and capital gain distributions are     
determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from      
generally accepted accounting principles. The differences are primarily due to  
differing treatments for foreign currency transactions.                         

The accumulated net realized loss on sales of investments in the Bond Fund at   
December 31, 1998, amounting to $17,124 is available to offset future taxable   
gains. If not applied, the capital loss carryover will expire in 2006.          

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS                                                   

Values of investments denominated in foreign currencies are converted into U.S. 
dollars using the spot market rate of exchange at the time of valuation.        
Purchases and sales of investments and dividend and interest income are         
translated into U.S. dollars using the spot market rate of exchange prevailing  
on the respective dates of such transactions. The gain or loss resulting from   
changes in foreign exchange rates is included with net realized and unrealized  
gain or loss from investments, as appropriate.                                  

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted   
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                               

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                                           

The Large Cap, Small Cap, and International Funds may enter into stock index    
futures contracts to hedge a portion of their portfolios. These contracts       
obligate a Fund to make or take delivery of a financial instrument or the cash  
value of a securities index at a specified future date at a specified price.    
Gains and losses are reflected as net realized gain (loss) on futures contracts 
in the statement of operations. Additionally, the International Fund may engage 
in portfolio hedging with respect to changes in currency exchange rates by      
entering into forward foreign currency contracts to purchase or sell foreign    
currencies. The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value
of financial instruments and securities indices (futures contracts) or from     
changes in foreign currency rates (forward foreign currency contracts) and the  
credit risk should a counterparty fail to perform under such contracts.         

3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES                                                 

The Trust has an investment advisory and management services agreement with     
State Farm Investment Management Corp. (Manager) who serves as the Trust's      
investment adviser and conducts the business and affairs of the Trust. Each Fund
pays the Manager an investment advisory fee (computed on a daily basis and paid 
quarterly) at the following annual rates:                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

Bond Fund                        .50% of average daily net assets

Money Market Fund                .40% of average daily net assets

The Manager has agreed not to be paid an investment advisory fee for performing 
its services for the Balanced Fund and has agreed to reimburse any other        
expenses incurred by the Balanced Fund. This expense limitation arrangement is  
voluntary and may be eliminated by the Manager at any time. However, the Manager
will receive investment advisory fees from managing the underlying Funds in     
which the Balanced Fund invests.                                                

With respect to each of the Funds other than the Balanced and International     
Funds, the Manager has agreed to reimburse the expenses incurred by the Fund,   
other than the investment advisory fee, that exceed .10% of such Fund's average 
daily net assets. With respect to the International Fund, the Manager has agreed
to reimburse the expenses incurred by the Fund, other than the investment       
advisory fee, that exceed .20% of the

Money Market Fund                                                       

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolios of investments, of the Large Cap Equity Index Fund, Small Cap    
Equity Index Fund, International Equity Index Fund, Stock and Bond Balanced     
Fund, Bond Fund and Money Market Fund, comprising the State Farm Variable       
Product Trust as of December 31, 1998, and the related statements of operations 
and changes in net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated
therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the            
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an    
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our     
audit.                                                                          

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are   
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,    
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our
procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 1998,  
by correspondence with the custodian. An audit also includes assessing the      
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each  
of the Funds of the State Farm Variable Product Trust at December 31, 1998, the 
results of their operations, the changes in their net assets and the financial  
highlights for the periods indicated therein in conformity with generally       
accepted accounting principles.

NOTICE OF WITHHOLDING ELECTION                    

This notice does not apply to distributions which qualify as eligible           
rollover distributions from tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs) and qualified        
employer retirement plans. We may be required to withhold 20% federal income    
tax on such eligible rollover distributions. To determine whether your          
distribution qualifies as an eligible rollover distribution and whether         
withholding applies, see the Special Tax Notice Regarding Plan Payments which   
is enclosed in the quarterly statements for TSA and qualified employer          
retirement plan participants.                                                   

Proceeds from your account not subject to the mandatory withholding described   
above, may be subject to federal and state income tax withholding unless you    
elect not to have withholding apply. Withholding will only apply to the         
portion of your distribution that is included in your income subject to         
federal income tax. There will be no withholding on non-taxable distributions.  

We are required by Federal Income Tax law to notify you of your right to        
elect not to have taxes withheld from any actual or deemed distribution, or     
to revoke your election to have taxes withheld, if one is in effect. If an
