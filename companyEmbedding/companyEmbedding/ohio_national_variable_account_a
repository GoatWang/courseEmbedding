Ohio National's Best Annuities Get An A+

By	
admin, with Annuity FYI


in A.M. Best, Financial Strength Ratings, Main Content, Moody's, Ohio National, S&P, Variable Annuities 
 

Ohio National will keep its ‘A+ Superior’ rating from A.M. Best, according to an Ohio National Financial Services news release.  The rating is based on the strength of their balance sheet, their business profile, and their operating performance.  This is the second to highest rating on A.M. Best’s 16-part scale.  Not only did Ohio National receive this ‘A+ Superior’ strength rating, but their rating outlook was upgraded to ‘stable’.  In a review of the company’s 2009 finances and operations, Ohio National was found to have some of the best annuities, as well as “strong risk-adjusted capitalization, positive net operating gains in 2009, and the improved position of its investment portfolio.”  They also had some strong increases from 2009 to the first quarter of 2010.
The other major financial rating companies also praised Ohio National’s financial strength this past April.  Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed their ‘AA’ (very strong) rating for the company’s ability to pay out claims.  This rating is S & P’s third-highest out of their 21-point scale.  Moody’s Investors Service maintained Ohio National’s ‘A1’ rating for insurance financial strength.  The ratings for Ohio National’s financial strength and ability to pay claims have not changed since 1991, which shows the company’s rock solid stability.  National Security Life and Annuity Company, Ohio National’s New York subsidiary offering variable annuities, received an ‘A Excellent’ rating which is the third highest possible.
