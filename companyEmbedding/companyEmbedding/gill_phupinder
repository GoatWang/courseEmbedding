Phupinder S. Gill was chief executive officer of CME Group from 2012 to the end of 2016, when he officially retired from the post. [1] He had been with the CME for 28 years.

Background
On November 11, 2016, CME Group announced that Gill would retire from the organization and board on December 31, 2016.[2]
The departure was announced just a year after he had renewed his employment contract to 2019.[3]
He took over the CEO position from Craig Donohue, who retired on May 1, 2012.
Gill was previously the president of CME Group, a position he held from July 2007 when CME and CBOT completed their merger until 2012.[4]
Prior to the merger, Gill served as the president and COO of CME Holdings and of CME starting on Jan. 1, 2004. Before that, he was a managing director and the president of the CME Clearing House Division and of GFX Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in proprietary trading of foreign exchange and Eurodollar futures, since March 2000.
He was the president of CME Clearing House Division from July 1998 to March 2000, senior vice president of the Clearing House Division from May 1997 to July 1998, and vice president from May 1994 to May 1997. Gill has held numerous other positions with CME since 1988, beginning with a job clerking on the floor of CME.
 He built the CME's risk models for derivatives after the exchange got into severe difficulty during the crash of 1987. 
Gill also serves as a director of the CME Foundation.[5]
In June 2012, traders working in the open-outcry pits of the CBOT sued CME, claiming new settlement rules were harming their business. On November 1, 2013, Gill testified in a trial concerning the lawsuit and denied that the CME Group changed its settlement rules to give electronic grain traders an advantage over trading floor veterans. Previously, CME settled futures prices for crops such as corn and soybeans based on transactions executed in the pits. According to Gill, the settlement methods changed "to reflect where the activity took place" in electronic markets.[6]

Education
Gill received a BA in Finance in 1985 and an MBA in 1987, both from Washington State University in Pullman, Wash.[7]

Awards
Gill was named Outstanding Chief Executive (Overseas) of the Year at the 2010 Singapore Business Awards. The SBA is jointly organized by The Business Times, Singapore’s leading business daily, and DHL Express Singapore, the express and logistics company. [8]

2016 Exchange CEO Series: CME’s Gill Looking For Customer Efficiencies

CME Group has been focused on global growth, just like every other major exchange. But to get there, the exchange leader believes it has to work with customers to streamline costs so it can expand.
In part one of our two-part interview at the FIA Boca Conference, Phupinder Gill said that the exchange is working on new ways to address capital efficiencies through products such as cleared swaptions, but also new clearing services that will help institutions reduce collateral.
CME is also continuing to work on market disruptors such as blockchain technology, which may change the way in which clearing services are delivered.

					    Speaker				    






All Speakers  







 










PHUPINDER GILL : Chief Executive Officer, CME Group
Phupinder Gill was appointed Chief Executive Officer of CME Group in May 2012.  In addition to running the firm’s day-to-day operations, he is responsible for implementing strategic initiatives to expand CME Group’s core business and pursue new global growth opportunities in over-the-counter and emerging markets. 
Gill leads a workforce of more than 2,800 professionals worldwide who are involved in financial technology development, clearing and risk management services, global operations, research and product development, legal and regulatory affairs, sales, marketing, corporate finance, business development, and human resources.  
Prior to assuming his current role, Gill served as CME Group’s President since 2004, where he helped set and execute the company’s strategy and oversaw the divisions responsible for products and services, technology, global operations, clearing, enterprise solutions, and research and product development.  From 2000 to 2003, Gill was Managing Director and President of CME Clearing, the largest derivatives clearing house in the United States, which includes the Clearing, Risk Management and Audit Departments.  In this role, he worked closely with most of the world’s major financial institutions — which are among CME Group’s largest customers — to ensure that CME Clearing provided the most efficient and cost-effective services and technologies for their client and proprietary trading activities.
In 2003, he led the implementation of the company’s historic clearing agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), under which CME provided clearing (back-office processing) for all CBOT products.  This agreement helped pave the way for the 2007 merger of the two institutions.  Previously, Gill was responsible for implementing the CLEARING 21® system and CME’s cross-margining arrangement with the Options Clearing Corporation, which significantly reduces performance bond requirements for firms.
Gill joined the company in February 1988 and held numerous positions within CME Clearing, including Senior Director of Risk Management, Vice President, and Senior Vice President, before his promotion to President, Clearing House in 1998.  During his tenure, he oversaw virtually every function performed by CME Clearing, including operations, risk management, collateral management, audits, settlements, trade processing, systems development and deliveries. 
Gill serves on CME Group’s Board of Directors, as well as the board of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) and WFE’s Regulatory Policy Committee.  He also serves on the Board of Directors of First Midwest Bancorp Inc. 
He is a member of CME Group’s Competitive Markets Advisory Council and sits on the boards of The Alexander Maxwell Grant Foundation, CME Group Foundation and CME Group Community Foundation.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in finance and an MBA degree, both from Washington State University.

			Phupinder Gill has led CME Group since 2012.
		




CME's effort to go global relies on immigrant CEO


The man driving CME Group's growth strategy was an unlikely leader when he arrived at the Chicago company in 1988, but today he's perhaps just what it needs. Born in Malaysia to parents of Indian descent, Phupinder Gill moved to the U.S. for college and, despite a stutter that developed in childhood, climbed an old-world Chicago hierarchy to become CME's CEO in 2012.  Now he's refocusing CME on international growth, as rivals like German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse make acquisition moves to expand globally. CME revenue from outside the U.S. has inched up to 30 percent from 27 percent while Gill has been chief, but if international consolidation continues, he'll be pressed for bigger gains. “They're not backing down,” says Carl Luft, an associate professor of finance at DePaul University who knows Gill well and says CME is likely to keep considering acquisitions if necessary. The company has missed a series of acquisition opportunities, the latest being the London Stock Exchange, which this month agreed to be acquired by Deutsche Boerse.  The 6-foot Gill, 55, with a cap of jet black hair tinged gray, doesn't seem the type to back down. Before coming to the U.S. in the early 1980s, he played rugby for the Singapore national team. And his Sikh heritage, from Punjabi grandparents, is known for warrior skills and five items that Sikh men traditionally wear: bangle, hair comb, undergarment, long hair and small dagger. Gill forgoes the last two. The son of two teachers, Gill grew up with three languages other than English—Malay, a dialect of Chinese called Hokkien and a smattering of Punjabi, he says in an interview. For college, he applied to several schools in the U.S. and ended up at Washington State University in rural Pullman, Wash., partly because his older brother lived in Seattle. He earned a bachelor's degree in finance in 1985 and an MBA in 1987. Then Chicago caught his eye as a financial center. He landed a job at the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1987, but he started on Black Monday and was laid off shortly after that market crash. The next year, he shifted across town to a job reporting prices from the trading pits on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. There, he faced a white male-dominated environment, where others principally served in supporting roles, he explained in an appearance before the Executives' Club of Chicago this month. But he didn't find the occasionally rude remarks on the trading floor any different from the kind of teasing he faced during his childhood in Singapore. “You get slammed and you get used to it and you learn how to insult back,” he says. “It's just part of life, so those of you that know me, know me to have an acid tongue in that sense, but I did not find Chicago much different from too many places.”
MENTORS
Eventually, Gill segued to the exchange's clearing operation, which acts as a kind of middleman in guaranteeing trades. He climbed the ranks with help from a senior executive, John Davidson, who became a mentor. After Davidson and other executives exited in the late 1990s, Gill became “the unanimous choice” to lead the clearinghouse in 1998, writes former CME Chairman Leo Melamed in his 2009 book, “For Crying Out Loud.” Another man who brought Gill along at CME was the late Fred Arditti, an early advocate of electronic trading and a former senior CME executive for whom DePaul's Arditti Center for Risk Management is named (it's led by Luft and also partially funded by CME). Arditti's “style was always very accepting, and he had the largest impact on who I am today,” Gill says. Gill also cited CME Executive Chairman Terry Duffy as a role model for his political savvy. Today, Gill leads a company that rang up $3.33 billion in revenue in 2015, as a record 3.5 billion in futures contracts changed hands mainly across its expansive electronic global trading platform and, to a much lesser degree, on its shrinking trading floors in Chicago. That revenue was only slightly ahead of 2011, after a three-year dip tied in large part to low volume and low volatility in the U.S. financial markets. Now Gill is sending CME employees abroad to better understand foreign clients and the products they want to cultivate. He says CME recognizes today that international clients are “a very big part” of its growth strategy. While some countries, especially those in Asia, have long kept foreigners out of their markets, making it difficult for outsiders to buy or build a presence, Gill expects that to change in the not-too-distant future. They will go through the same evolution other countries have, where they ultimately realize allowing foreigners in and opening to broader markets is in their best interest, Gill says. “Through the years we have found greater success in hiring people from diverse cultures, especially as we become more and more of a global firm,” he says.
