Our passion is entrepreneurial companiesWe have been building, advising, acquiring, and investing in entrepreneurial companies. At a strategic-level, our services can be broken into (4) key areas:

As financial strategic planning advisors, we work with you to smooth out the inevitable bumps and bangs that accompany businesses at every new milestone and critical juncture.Profit ImprovementLet’s say your revenue is growing by leaps and bounds, but your profits simply aren’t growing at the same trajectory. We specialize in making this gap disappear.  When it comes to profit improvement, we engineer a roadmap to your business’s goals and then work with you to make sure each step gets implemented.At a tactical-level, we welcome the opportunity to provide our team’s professional perspective on any situation with complete confidentiality and discretion.  The following areas are functions that should be occurring at your business now and are the deliverables you can expect from us:









Accurate and timely reporting

How we workOur engagements are for the purpose of creating shareholder value for the firms we serve. We evaluate your key business processes and procedures to ensure that you continue to operate efficiently and effectively without breaking the bank.  We dive in the trenches of accounting and finance and we implement key processes and procedures to make sure your business has finance and accounting best practices that provide a framework for ongoing growth. Then we build from there.  By always looking at it from the eyes of an investor, we’ve learned how to drive dollars to the bottom line year after year.   





Our FocusOur viewpoint is that making cash flow a priority makes everything easier for any business. Our strategic solutions are specifically designed to ensure your bank account is growing.  We focus on top-line revenue and efficiencies that drive the greatest financial result(s).  Our approach can make all the difference between whether your organization continues to thrive or ends up being swallowed by its own growth.  And as your consultant, we look at the full picture of your business—from current financial standings to long-term goals—and then we construct your customized top-line and profitability management solutions from there.

We specialize in acquisitions and financing for small-to-medium sized, privately held companies and real estate investments.



We InvestWe specialize in acquisitions and financing for small-to-medium sized, privately held companies, and real estate investments.  We will work with owners on structuring and executing financings for small-to-medium sized, privately-held companies. We offer our expertise and money in financing, leveraging and buying companies.  In essence, we assist in the structure and execution of equity and debt financing by making an investment in the owner.



















How We InvestWhen it comes to evaluating an investment, we try to determine whether we can optimize the strategy.  Our team pursues investments with great flexibility, moves aggressively into attractive opportunities, and capitalizes on changes in the business and economic landscape.   Our primary objective is to invest in cash flow businesses and we are often providing capital and expertise to help companies achieve their full potential.









Our Investment Focus

Our focus is on providing growth and expansion capital to companies primarily in the Southeast. Our firm addresses a niche underserved by the capital markets.  Our investments are more than just money because once we invest in these businesses, our team will provide expertise in revenue building, strategic oversight, operational guidance, and liquidation of holdings. We like to invest in businesses that generate recurring revenue and that have a strong likelihood of being able to generate cash flow with our capital and help.  We have built our firm, and other firms, on a strong foundation of intellectual and financial capital.
Investment Criteria

We look for investments that will generate long-term cash flow or that are extremely opportunistic.  For those kinds of investments, we bring experience as well as capital in an attempt to gain from investments into these business opportunities.  Although there is not a specific sector of focus for our investment dollars, companies with recurring revenue are desirable investments to us. Most investments are made into companies with annual revenues between $500K-5M (current, not projected).
