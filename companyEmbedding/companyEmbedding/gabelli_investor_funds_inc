 GABELLI INVESTOR FUNDS INC (Form: N-30B-2, Received: 11/18/1999 16:26:42) 











THE GABELLI ABC FUND




THIRD QUARTER REPORT


SEPTEMBER 30, 1999



TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,



Through most of the third quarter of 1999, stocks were slowly sinking under
the weight of a declining bond market,  a tumbling  dollar,  and the prospect of
more  aggressive   Federal  Reserve  monetary  policy   tightening.   Technology
stocks--the  last  bastion of  strength  in an  otherwise  weak  market--finally
cracked  in the last two weeks of the  quarter,  sending  virtually  all  market
indices  sharply lower.  Thanks to our cash reserves and positive  contributions
from our arbitrage investments,  the Fund posted a modest return for the quarter
as the major stock market indices declined.



INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE



For the third quarter ended September 30, 1999, The Gabelli ABC Fund's (the
"Fund") total return was 0.10%. The Standard & Poor's ("S&P") 500 Index declined
6.24%, while the Lipper U.S. Treasury Money Market Average had a total return of
1.06% over the same period. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged indicator of stock
market performance, while the Lipper Average reflects the average performance of
mutual funds classified in this particular category. The Fund was up 19.14% over
the trailing  twelve-month  period.  The S&P 500 Index and Lipper U.S.  Treasury
Money  Market  Average  rose  27.79%  and  4.17%,  respectively,  over  the same
twelve-month period.


For the five-year  period ended September 30, 1999, the Fund's total return
averaged 9.98% annually  versus average annual total returns of 25.03% and 4.75%
for  the  S&P  500  Index  and  Lipper  U.S.   Treasury  Money  Market  Average,
respectively.  Since  inception on May 14, 1993 through  September 30, 1999, the
Fund had a cumulative total return of 82.35%, which equates to an average annual
total return of 9.86%.



WHAT WE DO



The  Gabelli  ABC Fund and its  unique  Performance  Guaranty  Program  was
created in 1993 for conservative investors who had been reluctant to participate
in the equity  markets.  In other words,  it was a vehicle to allow investors to
"get their feet wet" in the stock market without risking loss of capital. We see
ourselves as an  "enhanced  money  market".  Our approach has been to maintain a
diversified portfolio of value-oriented equities,  convertible preferred stocks,
convertible  bonds and U.S.  government  securities.  Conceptually,  the  upside
potential of stocks would help produce  greater  total return  potential  than a
straight bond or government  securities  fund and the risk in the equity portion
of the portfolio would be diminished by the

(a) Total  returns and average  annual  returns  reflect  changes in share price and  reinvestment  of dividends  and are net of
expenses.  The net asset value of the Fund is reduced on the  ex-dividend  (payment) date by the amount of the dividend paid. Of
course, returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment returns and the principal value of an
investment  will  fluctuate.  When  shares  are  redeemed  they may be worth  more or less than their  original  cost.  (b) From

combination  of lower risk  convertible  securities and virtually risk free U.S.
Treasury bills.  To date, this approach has worked quite well.  Although we have
indefinitely  suspended the Performance  Guaranty Program, we believe the Fund's
investment strategy can continue to produce favorable results.



HISTORY OF THE FUND



The Gabelli ABC Fund was launched on May 14, 1993 with a minimum guaranteed
total return of 6% through May 14, 1994. For 1994, 1995 and 1996, 5% Performance
Guaranty  Programs  were in place.  These  programs  were  unique  because  they
provided investors the full upside potential of the

investment  while  guaranteeing a minimum total return.  Gabelli  Funds,  Inc.'s
fourth  Performance  Guaranty  Program  concluded on December 31, 1996 and a new
program was not in effect for 1997 or 1998. The Fund's annual total returns were
12.8% and 11.1%,  respectively,  for those two years.  Although the  Performance
Guaranty  Program is not being offered for 1999, the Fund continues  striving to
achieve the same  objectives.  During the most recent  four-year period in which
the S&P 500  Index has  delivered  25% plus  annual  returns,  a minimum  return
guarantee  of 5% appeared  dull and  unattractive.  However,  in terms of market
volatility, the Fund has provided comfort to the risk averse.

involving a longer term guaranty  program in a closed end structure.  This would
require shareholder approval.  Meanwhile,  the Fund will continue to be managed,
as it has been the past six  years,  to  provide  an  attractive  rate of return
without excessive risk of capital.



COMMENTARY




TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?



In the third quarter of 1999, the U.S. economy continued to barrel along at
a pace that investors feared would lead to higher  inflation.  Paced by the long
anticipated  recovery in Japan,  Asian  economies  are perking up.  Coupled with
prospects that European economies are gaining momentum, this has spawned concern
that  synchronized  global growth would further increase  inflationary  pressure
here at home. All of this positive global economic news was simply too much of a
good thing for the U.S. bond market, which continued to slide.


Long  term,  synchronized  global  growth is a  blessing--we  should all be
thinking  in terms of Gross World  Product  ("GWP")  rather than Gross  Domestic
Product ("GDP").  However,  in the short term it may put additional  pressure on
the Fed to press down on the monetary  brakes.  Investors  should view this as a
dose of cod liver oil--bitter  medicine,  but a tonic that will improve the long
term health of the economy and the stock  market.  Unfortunately,  "Mr.  Market"
often does not like to take his medicine and  additional Fed interest rate hikes
and higher bond yields are not likely to improve his mood. So, even though third
quarter corporate earnings are likely to be quite strong, price/earnings ("P/E")
multiples (a function of investor psychology and interest rates) may continue to
contract, sending stocks even lower. The good news in this scenario would be the
return of Ben Graham's "margin of safety" to the market.


If the domestic  economy begins to decelerate in the fourth quarter and the
Fed  declares a  monetary  cease-fire,  "Mr.  Market"  may be in a better  mood.
Although P/E multiples are not likely to expand,  they may  stabilize,  allowing
earnings to rally stocks.  However,  with equity  valuations still at relatively
lofty levels, advances will engender additional speculative risks.



THE DOLLAR IN LIMBO--HOW LOW CAN IT GO?



As we write,  the dollar has hit a four-year  low against the yen.  This is
another good news/bad news situation.  A cheaper dollar benefits U.S.  exporters
and  ultimately  would help reduce  trade  deficits,  which have been running at
extraordinarily  high levels. It also bolsters dollar denominated  earnings from
the international operations of U.S. companies. However, over the short term, it
actually increases dollar calculated trade deficits. Perhaps most importantly, a
lower dollar is potentially inflationary, because the


3





prices of imported  products that U.S.  consumers  treasure will move higher. If
the American  consumer is willing to pay these higher prices for Toyota cars and
trucks,  Sony big  screen  televisions,  and Sega video  games,  it will soon be
reflected  in the  Consumer  Price  Index  ("CPI").  This  leads  us to  another
important question...



WILL FATIGUE HIT THE AMERICAN CONSUMER?



High  employment  and the  "wealth  effect" of a rising  housing  and stock
market  have buoyed  consumer  confidence.  Discretionary  income has risen as a
result of depressed energy prices,  low mortgage rates, and rising wages. If the
domestic  economy does slow down,  consumers may become more concerned about job
security.  When investors  receive third quarter  statements from their brokers,
money managers and mutual funds, they will realize that their net worth has been
trimmed.  Americans  are  paying  more at the pump for  gasoline  and their home
heating bills will be significantly  higher this winter.  Variable rate mortgage
payments will increase and new fixed rate  mortgages are higher.  So,  consumers
will not be able to raise  spending money by leveraging  real estate  assets--no
more "take the home  mortgage  from  $100,000 to $150,000  with the same monthly
payments and pocket the difference". As aforementioned,  the prices for imported
goods are increasing.  Will all this be enough to cause the American consumer to
tighten the purse strings?  Or, will a significant tax cut--the  Republicans are
running on the "3 Fs"  (Faith,  Finances,  and  Family)--embolden  the  American
consumer and keep the economic wheels moving here and abroad?



THIS QUARTER'S SCORECARD



The ABC Fund's  portfolio  batting  average was over .500 this  quarter,  a
respectable  showing  in a weak  market.  Many of our hits came  from  arbitrage
investments.  One, United Water Resources ("UWR"),  was a home run. UWR returned
32% for the quarter. On the whole, however, most were not home runs--that is not
the idea behind  arbitrage  investing.  The portfolio is full of infield singles
that  helped us score some runs and  produce a  positive  return.  Cilcorp,  New
England Electric System and Thermo Power Corp.,  each a utility  arbitrage play,
all singled in runs with returns of 3.70%, 3.49% and 3.28%.


The scorecard was not perfect, however. A few of the Fund's arbitrage plays
looked as if they needed a pinch hitter, most notably Nalco Chemical,  Southwest
Gas, and  O'Sullivan  Industries  Holdings  (with  declines of 2.65%,  5.90% and
11.76%,  respectively).  The manager  decided to stay with the  veterans  and it
appears that they might be beginning to climb out of their respective slumps.


Since  arbitrage plays a major role in our portfolio  strategy,  we want to
share  excerpts  from an  article  we  prepared  for CIGAR  AFICIONADO  magazine
discussing what we believe is now a very exciting investment subject.



RISK ARBITRAGE--HOW TO PROFIT FROM "THE THIRD WAVE OF TAKEOVERS"TM




WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE THIRD  GREAT WAVE OF MERGERS AND  ACQUISITIONS  SINCE
WORLD WAR II.



The first wave swelled in the 1960s, with  conglomerators  like LTV's Jimmy
Ling,  Gulf &  Western's  Charles  Bluhdorn,  and ITT's  Harold  Geneen  merging
companies in non-related industries. They did so in


4





an attempt to produce more consistent  earnings growth through the ups and downs
of the business  cycle.  The second major wave of takeovers  began in the 1980s,
when financial engineers including leveraged buyout firms like Kohlberg,  Kravis
& Roberts,  and corporate raiders like T. Boone Pickens used junk debt to gobble
up undervalued  companies and then dismember them for a profit. This second wave
broke as  financially  unrealistic  deals  like the  proposed  leveraged  buyout
("LBO") of United Airlines fell apart, the junk bond market  collapsed,  and the
House  of  Drexel  disintegrated  under  the  weight  of a  government  criminal
investigation.


The  third  great  wave of  mergers  and  acquisitions  is being  driven by
consolidators--companies  in a wide range of industries  buying  competitors  in
order to extend  their  franchises,  trim costs and increase  profitability.  We
trace the  beginning of this wave to March 14, 1994,  when much admired  General
Electric  Chairman Jack Welch  launched a hostile bid to buy Kemper  Insurance -
signaling that deals were once again respectable.  This Third Wave will continue
to gain momentum as companies  worldwide  jockey for market position and profits
in the increasingly competitive global economy.



THERE  ARE TWO WAYS  INVESTORS  CAN TAKE  ADVANTAGE  OF MERGER  AND  ACQUISITION
ACTIVITY.



The first is buying public shares of likely takeover  candidates before the
"deal" is announced.  Gabelli Asset Management's  ability to identify industries
ripe for consolidation and our focus on undervalued  companies has resulted in a
long list of portfolio holdings being taken over at substantial  premiums to our
purchase  prices.  The  second  (and much less  known)  method is  through  risk
arbitrage.  It  would  take a book  to  detail  all  the  complexities  of  risk
arbitrage.  In this article, I'll provide the basics, and more importantly,  the
reasons why I believe risk arbitrage is such a compelling investment strategy.


Simply  stated,  risk  arbitrage is  investing  in a merger or  acquisition
target after the deal has been  announced and  pocketing the spread  between the
trading  price of the target  company  following the  announcement  and the deal
price  upon  closing.  This  spread is  usually  relatively  narrow--offering  a
somewhat  modest nominal total return.  However,  since deals generally close in
much less than a year's time,  this modest total return  translates  into a much
more attractive annualized return.


The following is a very basic risk arbitrage investment. On March 22, 1999,
the NYSE-listed  First Data Corp.  announced it would pay $25.50 in cash for all
the remaining  publicly owned shares of Paymentech,  Inc.  (52.5% of the company
would continue to be owned by Bank One, which has a merchant processing alliance
with First Data).  The deal was expected to close within four months.  Following
the  announcement,  we were able to purchase  Paymentech  shares for $24.02 (the
trading  price of $24 per share on the day the deal was  announced  plus 2 cents
per share in  commissions).  The spread between our purchase price and the value
of the stock upon closing was 6.2%. The deal closed on July 27, 1999, generating
an annualized return of 18.5%.


This particular  arbitrage worked out very well for us. We were able to buy
Paymentech shares at a good discount to the final transaction price and the deal
closed  on  schedule.  Not  all  arb  investments  produce  such  an  attractive
annualized return. However,  arbitrage portfolios have posted annualized returns
in the low to mid teens in the 1990s.

The  great  advantage  of risk  arbitrage  is that it is  largely  a market
neutral  strategy--deals  get done in good  markets  and  bad--that  can deliver
consistent returns even in volatile markets.


Because  a  conservatively   managed  risk  arbitrage   portfolio  produces
consistent  gains,  the financial  magic of  compounding  works  strongly in its
favor. Let me offer two examples of the power of compounding returns.


Once upon a time,  there was a king in a far away  land.  In order to repay
the local sage for saving his  daughter's  life,  the king  offered the sage any
reward he wished.  The sage asked for what appeared to be a modest  stipend--one
grain of rice - the  amount to be doubled  each day for 31 days.  The sage would
receive one grain of rice that day, two the next,  four the next, and so on. The
king thought nothing of giving away a few grains of rice on a daily basis.  But,
it was only a matter of weeks  before  the king's  granaries  were empty and the
sage had become the richest man in the land.  After only one month, the king was
paying  the sage over 1  billion  grains  of rice a day.  In 31 days,  one grain
became one billion through the magic of compounding.


The  purchase  of  Manhattan  Island from the Indians for just $24 worth of
beads is generally  considered one of the greatest  investments in history.  The
estimated value of all the real estate in Manhattan today is around $10 trillion
dollars. Amazingly, this equates to an annualized compounded return of just 7.4%
in the 375 years since the deal was done.


Of course,  arbitrage  investments  don't compound at 100% daily,  and most
investors' time horizons are much shorter than the 375 years it took to make the
purchase of Manhattan  look like such a great deal.  But consider the  following
hypothetical  scenario.  Alice and Bob both  invest $1 million  of their  401(k)
money in the year 2000.  Alice puts her money in a risk arbitrage fund that ends
up  returning  12% each  year for the next ten  years.  Bob puts his money in an
aggressive equity fund that gains 20% in eight of the ten years, but is down 20%
in year one and year six. In 2010, Alice has $3.1 million compared to Bob's $2.7
million,  despite the fact that Bob's returns were almost double Alice's returns
in eight of the ten years.


Are we shortchanging Bob in this scenario?  After all, the stock market has
had only one down year in the last 10,  and over that time  period,  the S&P 500
has posted an average  annual gain of 20%. True enough.  However,  the long term
average  annualized return from stocks is just over 11%, and I suggest that over
the next ten years,  equities  returns will more  closely  resemble the historic
norms. I would also opine that these returns will be accompanied by considerable
volatility--yes,  major  corrections  and perhaps a full scale bear market.  Are
Alice's  arb fund  returns  realistic?  Remember,  risk  arbitrage  returns  are
impacted  by deal flow,  not the  direction  of the stock  market.  If deal flow
continues to be as robust as we  anticipate  over the next ten years,  arb funds
have the potential to deliver consistent annual returns in the low to mid teens.
So, this hypothetical scenario may prove remarkably accurate.



AT THIS JUNCTURE, YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHERE IS THE RISK IN RISK ARBITRAGE?



The biggest  risk in risk  arbitrage  is that  announced  deals will not be
consummated and that the stock of the company to be acquired will sink following
a bust up in the deal. In fact, in virtually  every  individual  risk  arbitrage
investment, upside potential is dwarfed by downside risk. One old time pundit


6





said it best ...  "arbitrage is the only business we know where you risk dollars
to make  nickels." The second biggest risk is that the deal may take much longer
to close than first  anticipated,  turning an attractive  annualized gain into a
much more modest return.


Deals do break for a variety of reasons and a busted deal generally means a
big loss.  However,  during this third  great wave of mergers and  acquisitions,
96.5% of all announced  deals have been  consummated.  That puts the odds in the
arbritrageur's favor, particularly if he or she knows how to analyze a deal in a
manner that helps avoid most if not all the inevitable  potholes.  An adequately
diversified  arbitrage  portfolio is a must. A  diversified  arb  portfolio  can
withstand  the large  loss  from a broken  deal and still  generate  a  positive
return. Regarding the timing issue, deals do get stretched out, but provided one
is not investing with leverage or having to bear the cost of a short position in
a stock swap deal,  this  generally  results in a more modest gain rather than a
loss. Due to the complexities of most deals and because broad diversification is
absolutely   essential,   in  my  opinion,   risk  arbitrage  is  best  left  to
organizations  with  research and trading  expertise  and  sufficient  assets to
support a fully diversified arb portfolio.


But,  just  because you can't do it at home,  doesn't  mean that  investors
shouldn't take  advantage of this  relatively low risk strategy to create wealth
through  the  magic  of  compounding  returns.   There  are  numerous  arbitrage
partnerships open to individual investors.


So, when the next deal is  announced,  remember it is still not too late to
buy and earn an attractive return on your investment.



LET'S TALK STOCKS



The  following  are  stock  specifics  on  selected  holdings  of our Fund.
Favorable  earnings  prospects do not  necessarily  translate  into higher stock
prices,  but they do express a positive trend which we believe will develop over
time.


CILCORP INC. (CER - $64.8125 - NYSE), an Illinois utility company,  agreed to be
acquired by AES Corp. (AES - $59.00 - NYSE) for $1.3 billion in cash and assumed
debt, as the largest U.S. power-plant developer expands into the growing Midwest
electricity  market.  The offer is valued at $65 per share.  The  acquisition is
expected to be completed by mid-November.  Illinois's electric deregulation law,
which took effect last August,  will make it easier for AES to improve Cilcorp's
returns.  AES was  attracted  to CER because it is the lowest  cost  electricity
producer in Illinois and has been more willing to embrace  competition than many
other utilities.  Central Illinois Light, Cilcorp's main subsidiary, sells power
and natural gas to about 250,000 electric utility  customers in the central part
of the state.


FURON CO. (FCY - $24.93175  - NYSE),  a leading  designer  and  manufacturer  of
highly  engineered  products,  will be acquired  by  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain
through a $25.50 per share cash tender offer.  The tender is scheduled to expire
in the third quarter.  Saint-Gobain,  the world's top  glassmaker,  is expanding
into plastics with its purchase of Furon as companies are more frequently  using
plastics to replace materials such as glass and metals.


7





LONE STAR  INDUSTRIES  INC.  (LCE - $49.875 - NYSE),  the  U.S.'s  third-largest
publicly  held cement  company,  agreed to be acquired by  Germany's  number two
cement  company,  Dyckerhoff  AG,  for $1.2  billion in cash and  assumed  debt.
Dyckerhoff  will pay $50.00 per share for each share of LCE.  The deal will take
place in the form of a cash tender  offer.  The deal is expected to close in the
fourth  quarter of 1999.  Dyckerhoff  is turning to the strong $7.5 billion U.S.
construction  market which is benefiting from a robust domestic economy.  As the
U.S.  government  plans to spend up to $216  billion for new roads and  highways
through 2003, mergers in this industry are expected to continue at a rapid pace.


NALCO  CHEMICAL CO. (NLC - $50.50 - NYSE)  signed a  definitive  agreement to be
acquired by Suez  Lyonnaise  des Eaux for $4.5  billion,  or $53.00 per share in
cash.  Headquartered  in Naperville,  Illinois,  Nalco operates in more than 120
countries  and is the  world's  largest  producer  of  specialty  chemicals  and
services for water and industrial process treatment. Nalco is Suez's second U.S.
acquisition this year, and follows  Vivendi's March agreement to buy U.S. Filter
for $7.9 billion.  Suez has the largest  number of customers in the $500 billion
worldwide market for water and waste  treatment,  but Vivendi has a larger sales
volume.


NIELSEN MEDIA  RESEARCH  INC.  (NMR - $37.1875 - NYSE),  the leader in measuring
television  audiences,  agreed to be acquired by Dutch publishing company VNU NV
for $2.7 billion in cash and debt.  VNU, whose  publications  include  BILLBOARD
magazine and the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER,  will pay $37.75 per share in a cash tender
offer and assume $200  million in debt.  The Dutch  company  has been  acquiring
marketing  businesses,  which are more profitable than consumer publications and
less vulnerable to swings in economic  cycles.  The deal is expected to close in
the fourth quarter of 1999, and is subject to regulatory approval. While the two
companies  have a small  overlap  in the  advertising  information  market,  the
overlap is not expected to impede the close of the deal.


SOUTHWEST  GAS CORP.  (SWX - $26.9375 - NYSE) is a natural gas utility  based in
Las  Vegas,  providing  natural  gas  service to over 1.2  million  residential,
commercial  and  industrial  customers in one of the most  economically  vibrant
areas of the  United  States:  Arizona,  Nevada  and parts of  northeastern  and
southeastern  California.  Southwest is the nation's fastest growing natural gas
distribution  company.  Southwest Gas' board of directors has approved a revised
offer from Oneok Inc.  (OKE - $30.3125 - NYSE) to purchase all  outstanding  SWX
shares for $30.00 per share in cash, valuing Southwest Gas at approximately $1.8
billion,  including assumed debt.  Regulatory  approvals from the Nevada PUC and
the Arizona ACC have been obtained.


THERMO  POWER CORP.  (THP - $11.8125 - AMEX)  announced  it has  entered  into a
definitive  agreement to merge with its parent  company,  Thermo Electron (TMO -
$13.4375 - NYSE). Under terms of the agreement,  Thermo Electron will pay $12.00
per share in cash for the 20% of Thermo  Power it does not  currently  own.  The
terms of the merger  agreement were negotiated by a special  committee who hired
an  investment  banker  to  evaluate  Thermo  Electron's  merger  proposal.  The
transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 1999.


UNITED WATER RESOURCES INC. (UWR - $32.625 - NYSE) announced that Suez Lyonnaise
des Eaux SA will buy the  two-thirds of the company that they do not already own
for $1.8  billion in cash and  assumed  debt.  Suez will pay $35.00 per share in
cash and will assume $800 million in debt and preferred  stock of UWR, the No. 2
U.S. water company.  United Water provides water and sewer treatment services to
7.5 million


8





people in 19 states. Upon completion of the UWR acquisition, Suez Lyonnaise will
have  worldwide  water and  wastewater  revenues of more than $7.4 billion.  The
transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2000.



MINIMUM INITIAL INVESTMENT - $1,000



The Fund's  minimum  initial  investment  for both  regular and  retirement
accounts is $1,000.  There are no  subsequent  investment  minimums.  No initial

IN CONCLUSION



During a quarter in which the stock market indices  declined  sharply,  the
ABC Fund  delivered a modest return.  Our strategy of minimizing  portfolio risk
through  arbitrage  investing and maintaining  cash reserves during  challenging
markets  effectively  preserved  assets  during  this  difficult  period.  Going
forward, we continue to strive to maximize returns while minimizing market risk.

THE GABELLI ABC FUND




SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT


JUNE 30, 2000



"GIVE A MAN A FISH AND YOU FEED HIM FOR A DAY.





TEACH HIM HOW TO ARBITRAGE AND YOU FEED HIM FOREVER."


- Warren Buffett


[Graphic omitted of book cover "Deals...Deals...and More Deals]



TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,



At the end of the first  quarter of 2000,  long-dormant  value stocks were
finally attracting attention. The sharp technology stock correction, which began
in the second week of March,  revived the  antiquated  notion that the  severely
depressed stocks of high quality companies in out-of-favor industry groups might
be an  attractive  alternative  to the richly  priced  technology  stocks.  This
all-but-forgotten  concept gained credence as the previous drivers of the NASDAQ
continued to plummet in April.  However,  investors quickly lost interest in the
merits of value investing when technology  stocks began  rebounding in late May.
By the end of the second quarter, all eyes were once again focused on technology
stocks,  leaving the rest of the market adrift. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
("DJIA")  and  Standard & Poor's 500 Index  materially  outperformed  the NASDAQ
Composite Index during the second quarter, but momentum had clearly shifted back
to technology stocks at its close.


While public market  speculators  remain  ambivalent  about  fundamentally
inexpensive,  high  quality  companies  in more  prosaic  businesses,  the  true
connoisseurs  of  value--corporate  acquirers and leveraged  buyout  groups--are
aggressively  taking  advantage of the  attractive  merchandise  in the market's
discount bin. And, of course, value investors like us call this "our space."


The ABC Fund's conservative  portfolio mix of undervalued  equities,  U.S.
Treasury securities,  and risk arbitrage  investments helped it to a respectable
2.28% return this quarter and an impressive  4.77% gain for the first six months
of 2000.

(a) Total returns and average annual returns  reflect changes in share price and
reinvestment  of dividends  and are net of expenses.  The net asset value of the
Fund is reduced on the ex-dividend  (payment) date by the amount of the dividend
paid. Of course,  returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future
results.  Investment  returns  and the  principal  value of an  investment  will
fluctuate.  When shares are  redeemed  they may be worth more or less than their

original cost. (b) From commencement of investment operations on May 14, 1993.

COMMENTARY




"WHAT, ME WORRY?"



The labor market remains tight and the threat of wage-driven  inflation is
quite  real.  Despite  six  Federal  Reserve  interest  rate hikes over the last
eighteen  months,  the  economy  is still  growing at a pace that  troubles  the
monetary authorities. This is also an election year. While the campaign has been
a relatively quiet one, the rhetoric is sure to heat up as we approach November.
Political  posturing on economic  issues,  principally  how to  re-allocate  the
growing budget surplus, may rattle the financial markets.  Finally,  while there
are large pockets of attractive  fundamental  values in the equity markets,  the
overall market,  as measured by the S&P 500 Index, is still rather richly priced
relative to historic norms.


Of concern to us is the soaring  trade  deficit.  Thus far,  the world has
been happy to finance  this  deficit by buying U.S.  stocks and bonds.  This has
worked out well for all  concerned.  However,  if we see  inflation  continue to
trend higher and if the U.S. financial markets sputter,  international investors
may seek  opportunities  elsewhere.  Reduced  global  demand for U.S.  financial
assets may have a greater  impact on stocks  and bonds  than the  aforementioned
economic,  political,  and market issues. If international  demand dries up, the
favorable  supply/demand  dynamics the U.S.  financial markets have enjoyed over
the last decade may be disrupted.  In addition,  the Federal Reserve may have to
pump up  interest  rates  even  further,  and at the wrong  time,  to defend the
dollar.


That is the dark  side.  The  bright  side is that we are  finally  seeing
evidence  of  economic  deceleration.  Housing  starts  and home  sales are down
substantially,  and with the exception of oil, commodity prices have stabilized.
The most recently released  employment  numbers were relatively benign and there
are indications  that consumer  confidence has been dented.  For the time being,
the  Federal  Reserve  has spared us an  additional  rate  hike.  We just may be
returning  to a  "Goldilocks"  economy--not  too  hot,  not too  cool,  but just
right--that  will help propel stocks higher.  We have labeled this rosy economic
scenario  "Soft  Landing Part II".  Ideally,  we will see a much broader  market
advance in which companies in a wider range of industries participate.



A TUG OF WAR



For brief periods during the second quarter, market activity looked like a
tug-of-war  between  technology  and value stocks.  When the  tech-heavy  NASDAQ
Composite was down, the  value-oriented  Dow Jones was up, and vice-versa.  This
raises the  question of whether  tech stocks must fall before  stocks from value
sectors may rise, and if so, what economic and market phenomena may cause such a
reversal in fortune.


Let's  examine the economic  hypothesis  being used to glorify  technology
stocks and relegate value stocks to investment  purgatory.  The NASDAQ Composite
and DJIA  began to diverge  at the end of the  second  quarter of 1999,  when it
became clear the Federal  Reserve was  determined to raise  short-term  interest
rates until the economy slowed.  Technology  company earnings were thought to be
largely immune

to higher interest rates and a slower economy--an argument that had validity due
to strong secular growth trends in many tech sectors.  Earnings for economically
sensitive  companies  would  trend  lower  as the  economy  decelerated--also  a
reasonable  assumption.  Despite the Federal Reserve's best efforts, the economy
continued  to barrel along and we saw solid  earnings  gains across the industry
group  spectrum.  Tech stocks were  grandly  rewarded  for meeting or  exceeding
earnings  estimates,  but better than  expected  earnings for companies in other
industries  were largely  ignored.  At the close of this reporting  period,  the
NASDAQ Composite had a trailing  price/earnings ("P/E") multiple of 128.1, while
the Dow Jones Industrials had a trailing P/E of 21.8.


P/Es are a function of earnings  growth rates and interest rates. A company
growing  earnings at 30% per year  deserves a higher P/E than a company  growing
earnings  at 10%  annually.  However,  P/Es are also a  reflection  of  investor
sentiment.  Presently, quality tech stocks are priced as if nothing can go wrong
and quality companies in other industries are priced as if nothing can go right.
This challenges economic reality.


Wall Street  analysts are paid to look  forward,  but their  forecasts are
generally  strongly  biased by the past.  Over the last several  years,  leading
technology companies' earnings have beaten consensus projections.  Analysts have
responded  by raising  the  earnings  bar,  at least in part to justify  soaring
valuations.  If the economy slows, technology spending may moderate as well, and
tech companies' earnings may fall short of what we believe are overly optimistic
forecasts.   High  valuations   leave  little  room  for  even  modest  earnings
disappointments. Just ask the folks at Qualcomm and Lucent Technologies.


As for the rest of the market,  if the economy is  slowing,  earnings  for
economically  sensitive companies may have peaked, albeit a year later than many
anticipated.  Cyclical  stocks  have  received  little  tribute  for better than
expected  earnings.  In fact, we believe that  significantly  lower earnings are
already  baked into  valuations.  So, any  pleasant  surprises  should  generate
enthusiasm.  Other  industry  groups such as food and drug stocks  suffered more
from investor indifference than any present or potential earnings  dislocations.
Media stocks,  which stalled in 2000 after  exceptionally  strong performance in
1998-99,  may recapture stock market interest as  consolidation  in the industry
accelerates.  In the last year we have seen AOL combine with Time Warner, Viacom
acquire CBS, and the recently announced  Vivendi/Canal  Plus/Seagram  merger. We
think  there are many more deals,  big and small,  on the horizon as content and
distribution are linked to improve media companies' competitive positions on the
world stage. Telecommunications stocks have also taken a well-deserved rest this
year. However, the three forces driving the industry--technology,  deregulation,
and consolidation--remain firmly in place.


We are investment realists.  Technology is the pre-eminent growth industry
in the world and over the long term discriminating tech investors should receive
generous rewards. However, the current diet of nothing but super rich technology
stocks is dangerous.  The addition of some high protein,  low calorie items from
some other investment food groups will help promote healthier long-term results.



WHAT IS RISK ARBITRAGE?



Simply  stated,  risk  arbitrage is  investing in a merger or  acquisition
target after the deal has been  announced and  pocketing the spread  between the
trading  price of the target  company  following the  announcement  and the deal
price  upon  closing.  This  spread is  usually  relatively  narrow,  offering a
somewhat  modest nominal total return.  However,  since deals generally close in
much less than a year's time,  this modest total return  translates  into a much
more attractive annualized return.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS



The value of announced  mergers and acquisitions in the first half of 2000
increased to $894  billion  from $853 billion in the first half of 1999.  Merger
activity   continues  to  surge  as  companies  in  industries  such  as  banks,
broadcasters,  brokers,  telecommunications,  utilities, defense and health care
combine in response to falling regulatory barriers and increased competition.


A number of themes  continued  to  surface  in the first half of the year.
Cross border mergers, minority buyouts,  strategic acquisitions and hostile bids
all  highlighted a vibrant  arbitrage  environment.  Arbitrage  activity  should
remain  dynamic during the coming months as strategic  mergers and  acquisitions
continue to be announced in a variety of  industries.  We plan to  capitalize on
those opportunities that fit our investment philosophy.



INVESTMENT SCOREBOARD



Once again,  risk arbitrage  investments in announced deals provided solid
performance  for the  Fund.  Our  utility  investments  contributed  respectable
returns and helped  stabilize  the  portfolio  in the midst of a volatile  stock
market,  while  our  U.S.  Treasury  security  holdings,  approximately  15%  of
portfolio assets at the close of the quarter, added slow but steady returns.


Our losers list was dominated by cyclical companies such as Federal Mogul,
WHX, and Carlyle Industries. Our limited telecommunications  holdings, including
Shenandoah Telecommunications and Telegroup, also performed poorly.



LET'S TALK STOCKS



The  following  are stock  specifics  on  selected  holdings  of our Fund.
Favorable  earnings  prospects do not  necessarily  translate  into higher stock
prices,  but they do express a positive trend which we believe will develop over
time.


BESTFOODS  INC.  (BFO - $69.25 - NYSE)  agreed to a sweetened  buyout offer from
Unilever  (UN -  $42.98  - NYSE) of $73 per  share  in  cash,  or $24.3  billion
including assumed debt. The merger will create the world's largest food company.
The transaction is conditioned on the approvals of BFO and UN  shareholders  and
regulatory  approvals,  including the European Union and United States antitrust
clearance. The deal is not contingent upon financing. It is expected to close in
the fourth  quarter of 2000.  In May,  BFO rejected a $66 per share bid from the
Dutch food giant. Subsequently,  BFO opened merger talks with Campbell Soup Co.,
Diageo  plc,  and H. J.  Heinz,  putting  pressure  on UN to raise its bid.  The
acquisition adds such well-known  brands to UN's portfolio as Entenmann's  baked
goods and Hellmann's mayonnaise.  It will be accretive to UN's cash earnings per
share in the first full year of  operation,  resulting  in cost savings of about
$750 million  annually.  The  hostile-turned-friendly  deal is Unilever's  third
notable food acquisition in past months,  as it recently  acquired SlimFast diet
foods and Ben & Jerry's ice cream.


CENTRAL  NEWSPAPERS  INC.  (ECP - $63.25 - NYSE) has  agreed to be  acquired  by
Gannett Co. (GCI - $58.98 - NYSE), publisher of USA Today, for $2.75 billion. It
is the second largest newspaper deal in U.S. history.  GCI will pay $2.6 billion
in cash and assume $150 million in debt. Shareholders of each Class A share will
receive $64 and  shareholders of the Class B shares will receive $6.40.  GCI has
already commenced a


5





tender offer that should expire in August.  The Eugene C. Pulliam  Trust,  which
owns  approximately  78% of the voting power of ECP, has agreed to tender all of
its stock to GCI in the offer.  The trust's  affirmative  vote is  sufficient to
approve  the  merger.  The deal is subject to  regulatory  approval in the U.S.,
however  not that of the FCC.  The terms  value  ECP at about  11.2  times  2000
expected  EBITDA   (Earnings  Before   Interest,   Taxation,   Depreciation  and
Amortization)  and  9.5  times  2001  expected  EBITDA,  after  synergies.   The
transaction  should be accretive to Gannett's cash EPS for 2000 and in its first
full year in 2001.


LG&E  ENERGY  CORP.  (LGE -  $23.875 - NYSE)  will be  purchased  by the  U.K.'s
third-largest  power  generator,  PowerGen  plc  (PWG.LN - $8.56 - London  Stock
Exchange),  for about $5.4 billion in cash and assumed debt.  Under the terms of
the  transaction,  PWG will pay LGE  shareholders  $24.85 per share in cash. The
acquisition is subject to many  approvals,  including the  shareholders  of each
company,  the U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  Federal  Energy
Regulatory Commission,  the Kentucky Public Service Commission, and the Virginia
State  Corporation  Commission.  The combined company will have assets of nearly
$12 billion and total revenues of $8.7 billion.  The deal continues the trend of
U.K.  utilities  buying  their U.S.  counterparts  as the U.S.  market opens for
competition. It also ends PWG's two-year search for a U.S. partner, after it had
held talks with Cinergy, Florida Progress, and Houston Industries.


MCWHORTER  TECHNOLOGIES  INC.  (MWT -  $19.5625  - NYSE),  a maker of  specialty
chemicals, completed a merger with Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN - $47.75 - NYSE) on
July 10 in which EMN  bought MWT for $355  million  in cash and debt.  MWT makes
specialty  colorants and resins used in paints and  fiberglass.  EMN paid $19.70
per MWT share in a cash tender  offer,  a 42% premium to MWT's  closing price on
the day before the deal was announced.  The tender was conditioned  upon receipt
of a  minimum  of  50.1% of  shares  being  tendered  and  customary  regulatory
approvals.  EMN has  said  that  the  deal  will be  accretive  on a cash  basis
immediately and should turn accretive on an earnings basis during 2001.


PRIMARK CORP. (PMK - $37.25 - NYSE), a provider of financial data,  agreed to be
purchased by Canadian publishing giant The Thompson Corporation (TOC.TO - $34.21

- Toronto  Stock  Exchange)  for $842  million  in cash.  TOC will  also  assume
approximately  $235  million  in PMK  debt.  Under  the  merger  agreement,  PMK
shareholders  will receive $38 per share in cash, a 31% premium to PMK's closing
price on the day before the merger  announcement.  The approval  process  should
take a few  months,  with the merger  closing in the  second  half of 2000.  The
agreement  is  subject  to 51% or  more of PMK  shares  being  tendered  and the
expiration  of  certain  regulatory  approvals.  The  acquisition  will give TOC
control  of  the  two  leading   compilers  of   financial   forecasts  as  IBES
International  is added to its existing First  Call/Thomson  Financial unit. The
purchase will also increase TOC's  European  revenue from $130 million to almost
$400 million and overall revenue to $2 billion. PMK's international presence was
one of the driving factors behind TOC's interest in the deal.


RELIASTAR  FINANCIAL CORP. (RLR - $52.4375 - NYSE),  the eighth largest publicly
held life  insurance  company in the U.S.,  agreed to be  purchased by Dutch ING
Group NV  (INTNC.NA - $67.63 - Amsterdam  Stock  Exchange)  for $6.1  billion in
cash. ING will pay $54 for each share of RLR and assume approximately $1 billion
in debt. The offer price is a 75% premium to the price at which RLR traded prior
to the announcement of a deal. The transaction  will be financed  internally and
be immediately accretive to net profit per share for ING. The deal is subject to
approval from regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions and the
shareholders  of RLR.  The  transaction  will  take  place in the form of a cash
merger and should be completed in September.  Post merger,  ING's overall market
position in the U.S.  will go from  nineteenth  to eighth in terms of total life
and annuity  premiums.  Assets  under  management  will  almost  double from $39
billion to $75 billion.

SHARED  MEDICAL  SYSTEMS  CORP.  (SMS -  $72.9375 - NYSE) was sold to Siemens AG
(SIE.GR  -  $150.45  -  Frankfurt  Stock  Exchange),  a German  manufacturer  of
industrial and consumer products,  for $2.1 billion in cash on July 5. SMS is an
application  service provider for the health care industry.  SIE launched a cash
tender offer at $73 per share. The deal received the approval of U.S.  antitrust
authorities  and  receipt of  approval  from the German  antitrust  authorities.
Because  there is a slight  product  overlap in  Germany,  the  German  approval
delayed the close of the tender to early July. The overlap,  however,  is only a
small portion of the firms'  revenues.  The acquisition is an effort on the part
of SIE to bolster  its  presence  in the health  care IT market.  That market is
expected  to grow ten percent  annually  going  forward.  In early  March,  SMS'
competitor  Eclipsys  Corp.  launched a hostile  offer of $67 per share for SMS.
That bid was  dropped in late  March when  Eclipsys  agreed to be  purchased  by
Neoforma.com Inc.


UNITED WATER  RESOURCES  INC. (UWR - $33.50 - NYSE) will sell the  two-thirds of
the  company  that Suez  Lyonnaise  des Eaux SA  (LY.FP - $175.29 - Paris  Stock
Exchange)  does not already own to LY for $1.8 billion in cash and assumed debt.
LY  offered  $35 per  share in cash and will  assume  $800  million  in debt and
preferred  stock of UWR, the No. 2 U.S.  water  company.  In 1999,  LY purchased
Nalco  Chemical,  the largest  U.S.  maker of  water-treatment  chemicals.  LY's
acquisitions  in the U.S.  water market are part of its effort to keep pace with
its French rival Vivendi,  which purchased U.S. Filter,  a U.S.  water-treatment
company,  in April 1999. UWR provides water and sewer treatment  services to 7.5
million  people in 19 states.  It had sales of $356.2  million  last year.  Upon
completion of the UWR  acquisition,  LY will have worldwide water and wastewater
revenues of more than $7.4 billion.


VASTAR  RESOURCES  INC.  (VRI -  $82.125 - NYSE),  an  82%-owned  subsidiary  of
Atlantic  Richfield,  has received an offer from BP Amoco (BPA - $56.625 - NYSE)
for $71 per share. BPA purchased Atlantic Richfield on April 18 for $34 billion,
and wants to buy the  minority  shares  of VRI.  VRI is an oil and  natural  gas
exploration and production  company.  VRI has said that it will refer the matter
to a special committee of independent directors and will provide further comment
in due  course.  VRI is  trading  above the  offer  price  from BPA,  reflecting
investor  sentiment  that BPA will have to increase its offer in order to finish
the deal and buy the shares.


VERIO INC. (VRIO - $55.4844 - NASDAQ),  a provider of Internet services to small
and  mid-sized  businesses,  agreed to a buyout  from its  largest  shareholder,
Nippon  Telegraph & Telephone  (9432.JP -  $13,273.00  - Tokyo Stock  Exchange),
worth $5.5  billion.  NTT will pay $60 per share in cash,  a 67%  premium to the
price at which VRIO closed on the day prior to the  announcement of the deal. In
order to complete the merger,  the firms need antitrust  approval under the Hart
Scott Rodino Act, and U.S. government approval under the Exxon-Florio Act. It is
possible that the timeframe for the second approval could be extended as certain
politicians  in Congress have lobbied to require NTT to lower its local Japanese
interconnection fees in return for approval of the deal. NTT, which already owns
11.4% of VRIO, is buying the Web hosting  service-company to broaden its control
over Internet services provided by the company.  VRIO is the world's largest Web
hosting firm, as ranked by number of domain names.

THE GABELLI ABC FUND






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)





1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli ABC Fund (the "Fund"), a series of Gabelli Investor
Funds, Inc. (the "Corporation"), was organized on October 30, 1992 as a Maryland
corporation.  The  Fund is a  non-diversified,  open-end  management  investment
company  registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act").  The Fund's primary  objective is to achieve total returns that are
attractive to investors in various market  conditions  without excessive risk of
capital loss. The Fund commenced investment operations on May 14, 1993.


2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts and disclosures
in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.


SECURITY  VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities  listed or  traded  on a  nationally
recognized securities exchange, quoted by the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotations, Inc. ("Nasdaq") or traded on foreign exchanges are
valued at the last sale price on that  exchange  as of the close of  business on
the day the  securities  are being  valued (if there were no sales that day, the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day,  except for open short  positions,  which are
valued at the last  asked  price).  All  other  portfolio  securities  for which
over-the-counter  market  quotations  are  readily  available  are valued at the
latest average of the bid and asked prices.  Portfolio securities traded on more
than one  national  securities  exchange or market are valued  according  to the
broadest and most  representative  market,  as determined by Gabelli Funds,  LLC
(the  "Adviser").  Securities  and assets for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  are valued at their fair value as  determined  in good faith
under procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board
of Directors. Short term debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, unless the Directors  determine such does not
reflect the  securities'  fair  value,  in which case these  securities  will be
valued at their fair value as  determined  by the  Directors.  Debt  instruments
having a  maturity  greater  than 60 days are  valued at the  highest  bid price
obtained from a dealer maintaining an active market in those securities. Options
are valued at the last sale price on the  exchange on which they are listed.  If
no sales of such options  have taken place that day,  they will be valued at the
mean between their closing bid and asked prices.


REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements  with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or with other brokers or dealers
that meet credit guidelines established by the Adviser and reviewed by the Board
of Directors.  Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 100% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the

THE GABELLI ABC FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)





collateral.  If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral  declines or
if  bankruptcy  proceedings  are  commenced  with  respect  to the seller of the
security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.


FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose of
hedging  against  changes in the value of its  portfolio  securities  and in the
value of  securities  it  intends  to  purchase.  Upon  entering  into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or  received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuation  of the
value of the  contract.  The daily  changes  in the  contract  are  included  in
unrealized gains or losses. The Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss when the
contract is closed. At June 30, 2000, there were no open futures contracts.


There are several  risks in  connection  with the use of futures  contracts as a
hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts  primarily  corresponds
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged investments.  In addition,  there is the risk that
the Fund may not be able to  enter  into a  closing  transaction  because  of an
illiquid secondary market.


SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME.  Securities  transactions  are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.


DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS.  Dividends and  distributions to
shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and
capital  gain  distributions  are  determined  in  accordance  with  income  tax
regulations  which may differ from  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing  treatments of income and gains
on various  investment  securities  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing characterization of distributions made by the Fund.


PROVISION  FOR  INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund  intends  to  continue  to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. As a result, a Federal income tax provision is not required.


3.  INVESTMENT  ADVISORY  AGREEMENT.  The Fund has  entered  into an  investment
advisory  agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement")  with the Adviser which provides
that the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee,  computed  daily and paid monthly,  at
the annual rate of 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average daily net assets. In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment program for the Fund's portfolio,  oversees the administration of all
aspects of the Fund's  business  and  affairs and pays the  compensation  of all
Officers and Directors of the Fund who are its affiliates.


4.  DISTRIBUTION  PLAN. The Fund's Board of Directors has adopted a distribution
plan (the "Plan")  pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. For the six months
ended June 30, 2000, the Fund incurred  distribution  costs payable to Gabelli &
Company,  Inc.,  an affiliate of the  Adviser,  of $82,590,  or 0.25% of average
daily net  assets,  the annual  limitation  under the Plan.  Such  payments  are
accrued daily and paid monthly.

Semi-Annual Report
 June 30, 1998

To Our Shareholders,                                                            

  In the second quarter of 1998, there was a continuation of the best of
times for large cap stocks and the worst of times for small cap stocks. During  
the quarter, the large cap market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's (S&P)   
500 Index, rose by 3.3% while small cap stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 
Index, declined by 4.7%. U.S. government bonds rallied in a classic global      
"flight to quality", with the yield on the 30 year U.S. Treasury Bond falling to
5.57% in mid-June.                                                              

Investment Performance                                                          

   For the second quarter ended June 30, 1998, the Gabelli ABC Fund's (the
"Fund") total return was 0.4%. The Fund was up 10.8% over the trailing twelve   
month period. For the five year period ended June 30, 1998, the Fund's return   
averaged 9.8% annually. Since inception on May 14, 1993 through June 30, 1998,  
the Fund had a total return of 60.9%, which equates to an average annual return 
of 9.7%. The Fund seeks to achieve total returns that are attractive to         
investors in various market environments without excessive risk of capital loss.

What We  Do                                                                     

[GRAPHIC OMITTED]                                                               

The Gabelli ABC Fund and its unique Performance Guaranty Program was
created in 1993 for conservative investors who had been reluctant to participate
in the equity markets. In other words, it was a vehicle to allow investors to   
"get their feet wet" in the stock market without risking loss of capital. We see
ourselves as an "enhanced money market." Our approach has been to maintain a    
diversified portfolio of value oriented equities, convertible preferred stocks, 
convertible bonds and U.S. government securities. Conceptually, the upside      
potential of stocks would help produce greater total return potential than a    
straight bond or government securities fund and the risk in the equity portion  
of the portfolio would be diminished by the combination of lower risk           
convertible securities and virtually risk free U.S. Treasury Bills. To date,    
this approach has worked quite well. Although we have indefinitely suspended the
Performance Guaranty Program, we believe the Fund's investment strategy can     
continue to produce favorable results.

(a) Total returns and average annual returns reflect changes in share price and 
reinvestment of dividends and are net of expenses. The net asset value of the   
Fund is reduced on the ex-dividend (payment) date by the amount of the dividend 
paid. Of course, returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future 
results. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will       
fluctuate. When shares are redeemed they may be worth more or less than their   
original cost. (b) From commencement of operations on May 14, 1993.

History of the Fund                                                             

The Gabelli ABC Fund was launched on May 14, 1993 with a minimum    
guaranteed total return of 6% through May 13, 1994. For 1994, 1995 and 1996, 5% 
Performance Guaranty Programs were in place. These programs were unique because 
they provided investors the full upside potential of the investment while       
guaranteeing a minimum total return. Gabelli Funds, Inc.'s fourth Performance   
Guaranty Program concluded on December 31, 1996 and a new program was not in    
effect for 1997. Although the Performance Guaranty Program is not being offered 
for 1998, the Fund continues striving to achieve the same objectives. During the
most recent three year period in which the S&P 500 has delivered 25% plus annual
returns, a minimum return guarantee of 5% appeared dull and unattractive.       
However, in terms of market volatility, the Fund has provided comfort to the    
risk averse.                                                                    

  The Adviser and Board of Directors are exploring several options as we
look ahead. We are considering a longer term guaranty program in a closed end   
structure. This would require shareholder

approval and would be an attractive format for initial investors. The program   
would be available to all investors in the Fund as of June 30, 1998.            

   The Fund will continue to be managed, as it has been over the past five
years, to provide an attractive rate of return without excessive risk of        
capital.                                                                        

Commentary                                                                      

    In compiling our thoughts for this shareholder letter, we looked forward
by looking through the rear view mirror. In the process, we witnessed the       
testimony of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and we could not say 
it any better. To quote Alan . . .                                              

"Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I appreciate this 
opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's midyear report on monetary   
policy.                                                                   

Overall, the performance of the U.S. economy continues to be  
  impressive. Over the first part of the year, we experienced further gains in
   output and employment, subdued prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.
   Important crosscurrents, however, have been impacting the economy. With labor
   markets very tight and domestic final demand retaining considerable momentum,
the risks of a pickup in inflation remain significant. But inventory      
   investment, which was quite rapid late last year and early this year, appears
to have slowed, perhaps appreciably. Moreover, the economic and financial 
   troubles in Asian economies are now demonstrably restraining demands for U.S.
  goods and services -- and those troubles could intensify and spread further.
 Weighting these forces, the Federal Open Market Committee chose to keep the
stance of policy unchanged over the first half of 1998. However, should   
  pressures on labor resources begin to show through more impressively in cost
increases, policy action may need to counter any associated tendency for  
prices to accelerate before it undermines this extraordinary expansion."  

      -- Excerpt from the Monetary Policy Testimony and Report to Congress
  Before the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy of the
 Committee on Banking and Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives,
July 21, 1998.                                                            

Arbitrage: A Favorable Risk/Reward Investment Strategy                          

      In light of the uncertainty over how the Asian economic crisis will impact
the U.S. economy and stock market, shareholders may be surprised to see that the
cash levels in the Fund have dropped from 68% of assets at the end of the first 
quarter of 1998 to 19% at the close of the second quarter. How have we been     
spending this money? Primarily by investing in arbitrage situations such as     
Allied Group, DeKalb Genetics, Orange & Rockland Utilities, Mercantile Stores,  
Giant Food and Southern New England Telecommunications.

 What is arbitrage? We define arbitrage as investing in "event" driven
situations; primarily, but not exclusively, in announced mergers, acquisitions, 
reorganizations and other "work-out" opportunities. When a company agrees to be 
acquired by another company, its stock price generally immediately rises to just
below the stated acquisition price. We look at the spread between the seller's  
stock price and the announced deal price and the time frame in which the        
acquisition is expected to close. If we are confident the acquisition will be   
consummated on schedule at the full deal price and we can earn an annualized    
rate of return materially higher than that likely to be realized through        
investing in cash equivalents, then we are interested.                          

  We do the research. We value the target company to see if it is really
worth what the acquiring company has announced it will pay. Sometimes we find it
is worth even more, increasing the odds that some other company might make a    
higher bid. We also research the acquiring company to insure that it can finance
the deal. If it is a stock transaction, we need to know that we will be         
receiving good value in return. We look at merger agreements to see if there are
any loopholes. We review any antitrust concerns raised by the government. In    
short, we make judgements to assure that what we see will be what we get.       

     There is greater risk in this strategy than in simply owning money market
instruments because announced acquisitions are not always completed and, in     
situations where the deal currency is the acquirer's stock as opposed to cash,  
the ultimate acquisition price may vary in value. However, if we do a thorough  
job evaluating the downside risk, we can often earn generous returns relative to
the money markets, particularly with today's low money market yields. In        
summation, we think arbitrage as we practice it in the ABC Fund, represents an  
attractive investment opportunity with historically low correlation to the      
performance of the overall stock market.                                        

    We borrow a quote from Warren Buffett to explain our use of arbitrage in
the Fund: "Our subsidiaries sometimes engage in arbitrage as an alternative to  
holding short term cash equivalents. We prefer, of course, to make major long   
term commitments. But we often have more cash than good ideas. At such times    
arbitrage sometimes promises much greater returns than Treasury Bills and,      
equally important, cools any temptation we may have to relax our standards for  
long term investments."                                                         

Let's Talk Stocks                                                               

The following are stock specifics on selected holdings of our Fund. 
Favorable earnings prospects do not necessarily translate into higher stock     
prices, but they do express a positive trend which we believe will develop over 
time.                                                                           

Allied Group Inc. (GRP - $46.8125 - NYSE) accepted a sweetened offer of $1.7    
billion from Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., allowing Nationwide to expand in  
the Midwest through a rare unsolicited takeover in the insurance industry.      
Nationwide will pay $48.25 per share ($1.5 billion) for all of Allied's shares. 
It also plans to combine with Allied Mutual Insurance Co. - which owns 18.2% of 
Allied's voting rights - by distributing $110 million to Allied policyholders   
and paying $30 per share ($84 million) for 2.8 million publicly held shares of  
Allied Life Financial Corp. (ALFC - $28.875 - Nasdaq), a unit of Allied Mutual. 
In

May, Nationwide made the unsolicited takeover bid after being rebuffed by Des   
Moines, Iowa-based Allied Group for several months. Nationwide first approached 
Allied's management about an acquisition in January 1998. After repeated        
rejections by Allied, Nationwide took its case directly to shareholders in May, 
offering to buy outstanding shares for $47 each. Nationwide eventually sweetened
its offer to $48.25 per share, gaining Allied's approval for the transaction.   
Nationwide expects to complete the transaction during the late third or early   
fourth quarter of this year. The companies must also obtain the approval of     
insurance regulators in Ohio, Iowa, Arizona and other states.                   

American Bankers Insurance Group Inc. (ABI - $60.125 - NYSE) agreed to be       
acquired by Cendant Corp. (CD - $20.875 - NYSE) for $3.1 billion ($67 per share)
in stock and cash, making the combined company a leading direct-marketer of     
insurance. American Bankers had been the object of a bidding war since late     
January, when Cendant unveiled a $58 per share ($2.7 billion) tender offer,     
topping a $47 per share ($2.2 billion) bid that American International Group    
proposed in December. AIG matched the bid on March 2, after trying to hobble    
Cendant with legal and regulatory filings. Cendant retaliated with a $67 per    
share offer on March 16. AIG declined to match Cendant's bid but walked away    
with a $110 million breakup fee. Cendant wants to add credit life insurance to  
the range of travel, shopping and other services it sells to millions of        
consumers. The agreed $67 per share offer consists of one-half stock and        
one-half cash. The cash portion is being paid through a tender offer with the   
balance to be paid in Cendant stock. The tender offer and stock swap are        
conditioned on the companies receiving several state insurance regulatory       
approvals and is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter.      

BET Holdings Inc. (BTV - $62.9375 - NYSE) is a media and entertainment company  
that primarily targets black consumers, a market that was estimated to have     
spent over $450 billion in 1997. BTV's core business is Black Entertainment     
Television (BET), an advertiser-supported cable television programming service. 
Of the 70 million cable households in the U.S., BET reaches over 51 million. BET
on Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel produced nearly 150 hours of original jazz      
programming in 1997. Action Pay-Per-View's subscriber base has grown to over    
nine million as the service expands beyond a traditional urban audience. The    
company is leveraging its brand identity into markets including pay-per-view    
movies, direct merchandising and magazine publishing. The $48 per share offer   
from a group led by founder Robert Johnson to take BTV private has been         
increased to $63 per share.                                                     

DeKalb Genetics Corp. (DKB - $94.625 - NYSE) agreed to be acquired by Monsanto  
(MTC - $55.875 - NYSE) through a $100 per share cash tender offer. Monsanto will
pay $2.3 billion for the 60% of DeKalb it doesn't already own. Monsanto won the 
auction for DeKalb after the company put itself up for sale earlier in the      
quarter. Monsanto's simultaneous agreement with Delta & Pine gives it two of the
last remaining available seed companies. Monsanto's twin purchases underscore   
the growth potential of the emerging agricultural biotechnology industry, which 
by some estimates will generate $20 billion in annual sales of genetically      
engineered seed by 2010, up from today's minimal base. DeKalb and Delta & Pine  
provide crucial gateways through which Monsanto can introduce and distribute    
technology that makes crops resistant to insects and herbicides or more         
nutritional, whether as food or animal feed. Monsanto currently owns 45% of     
DeKalb's non-voting stock and 10% of its voting stock, for an overall holding of
40%. The Roberts family, which controls 56% of the voting shares, has agreed to 
the sale. The transaction is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter,
pending U.S. antitrust review.

Giant Food Inc. (GFS'A - $43.0625 - ASE) agreed to be acquired by Royal Ahold NV
(AHO - $32.00 - NYSE), the Netherlands' largest retailer, for more than $2.7    
billion in cash ($43.50 per share). The acquisition makes Ahold the             
fifth-largest U.S. supermarket company. Ahold agreed to buy all voting shares   
from Giant's management and J Sainsbury plc, Britain's second-largest           
supermarket operator. Sainsbury also agreed to sell its 20% non-voting share    
stake, which amounts to 11.8 million of Giant's 59.9 million Class A shares.    
Combining Giant's 176 stores in the Washington-Baltimore region with other      
recent acquisitions will push Ahold's sales to $35 billion from $26 billion in  
1997. The purchase will help AHO cut costs and prices paid to suppliers in the  
U.S., where it already owns six other chains, from Stop & Shop in New England to
BI-LO in the Southeast. Ahold is still seeking additional companies to buy in   
the U.S. as well as in South America, Asia and Europe. The original withdrawal  
and expiration of the tender offer was June 17, 1998. The tender offer has been 
extended to August 14, 1998 to accommodate all necessary regulatory filings. The
transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 1998.

Mercantile Stores Co. (MST - $78.9375 - NYSE) agreed to be acquired by Dillard's
(DDS - $41.4375 - NYSE) for $3.14 billion in cash and assumed debt. Dillard's is
one of the largest department store companies in the U.S. with 272 stores, while
Fairfield, Ohio-based Mercantile operates 103 stores under the Gayfers, Maison  
Blanche and McAlpin's names. The Milliken family, which owns 40% of MST, agreed 
to support the transaction. Dillard's will be able to cut costs by combining    
advertising and distribution because both chains operate in many of the same    
markets. Dillard's will pay $80 per share in a cash tender offer for each MST   
share, or $2.94 billion. Dillard's plans to sell or swap as many as a quarter of
Mercantile's stores because it doesn't want to have two stores in the same      
market. All of the stores will carry the Dillard's name. The transaction is     
expected to be completed during the third quarter.                              

Nashua Corp. (NSH - $15.625 - NYSE) markets specialty imaging products and      
services to consumers and commercial customers. The company's products included 
domestic photofinishing services, imaging supplies and pressure-sensitive       
labels. Nashua is narrowing its business focus. The company's entire            
photofinishing group has been sold for $52.5 million. The specialty coated      
products division, which the company previously intended to sell, is now making 
a positive contribution with new products, lower costs and better margins.      

Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc. (ORU - $53.6875 - NYSE) agreed to be acquired  
by Consolidated Edison (ED - $46.0625 - NYSE) for $1.15 billion in cash and     
assumed debt, allowing Con Edison to boost its power transmission business in a 
growing part of the New York City area. Orange & Rockland, a small utility with 
most of its customers in New York's northern suburbs, will become a subsidiary  
of Con Edison, the giant power company that serves New York itself. The buyout  
is the first step toward greater consolidation in the utility industry in New   
York State, which is opening its $11 billion in annual electricity sales to     
competition over the next few years. ED will pay $790 million in cash ($58.50   
per share) for ORU. Both Con Edison and Orange & Rockland will sell off most of 
their power plants as part of New York's deregulation plan. The companies       
instead will generate revenue from the fees they charge others for moving       
electricity on their power lines. The transaction is expected to receive all    
necessary regulatory approvals within a year. In addition to the $58.50 per     
share we will be receiving in the merger, ORU also pays a $2.58 annual dividend.

SPS Transaction Services Inc. (PAY - $31.375 - NYSE) agreed to be acquired by   
Associates First Capital Corp. (AFS - $76.9375 - NYSE), the largest U.S.        
consumer finance company, for $896 million in cash. Dallas-based Associates     
First is buying the assets of SPS, which issues credit-cards for companies such 
as Office Depot and Tandy Corp.'s Radio Shack, from Morgan Stanley and public   
shareholders. Associates First similarly administers and owns receivables for   
the private-label credit card operations of Texaco and Amoco. SPS will pay its  
public shareholders roughly $32 per share from the proceeds of the asset sale.  
The transaction will let Associates First, which gets most of its income from   
consumer loans and credit cards, expand fee revenue that's less dependent on    
interest rate changes. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is 
expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter.                       

Triangle Pacific Corp. (TRIP - $55.00 - Nasdaq) agreed to be acquired by        
Armstrong World Industries (ACK - $67.375 - NYSE), a floor coverings company,   
for $1.15 billion in cash and assumed debt. Armstrong will pay $890 million in  
cash ($55.50 per share) to Triangle Pacific shareholders. Dallas-based Triangle 
Pacific makes hardwood flooring products and kitchen and bathroom cabinets.     
Armstrong, the leading North American producer of vinyl floor coverings, is     
hoping to expand its presence in other areas of the hard-floor covering market. 
Upon Armstrong's completion of the acquisition of Triangle, the combined company
will be the second largest maker of floor coverings in the world after Shaw     
Industries, a carpet maker, and the largest maker of hard-floor coverings in the
world. The expiration of the tender offer is July 17.

No Load - Effective January 2, 1997                                             

   Effective January 2, 1997, the Fund no longer imposes a front end sales
charge. All purchases made after January 1, 1997 are no load, that is, without a
sales charge. New and current shareholders may purchase shares of the Fund at   
any time.                                                                       

The Roth IRA                                                                    

The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included new tax incentives and more
opportunities to save for retirement and other major expenditures. The Roth IRA 
is just one of these new opportunities now available at Gabelli Funds. Our      
investor representatives are available at 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554) to     
speak with you about establishing a new Roth IRA and to discuss your investment

In Conclusion                                                                   

     We believe it is still too early to accurately assess the impact of Asian
economic distress on the U.S. economy and corporate earnings. However, Asia's   
problems may prolong investment uncertainty and restrain stock prices, perhaps  
for the balance of the year. We have hedged the portfolio's downside risk by    
retaining 19% in cash equivalents and investing in arbitrage situations we      
believe will generate solid returns irrespective of whatever may happen to the  
stock market during what we believe will be challenging times for the overall   
market.

The Gabelli ABC Fund                                                            
Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)                                       
================================================================================

1. Description. The Gabelli ABC Fund (the "Fund"), a series of Gabelli Investor 
Funds, Inc. (the "Corporation"), was organized on October 30, 1992 as a Maryland
corporation. The Fund is a non-diversified, open-end management investment      
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the    
"1940 Act"), whose primary objective is to achieve total returns that are       
attractive to investors in various market conditions without excessive risk of  
capital loss. The Fund commenced operations on May 14, 1993.                    

2. Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of financial statements in  
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the   
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.                            

Security Valuation. Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally       
recognized securities exchange, quoted by the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotations, Inc. ("Nasdaq") or traded on foreign exchanges are
valued at the last sale price on that exchange as of the close of business on   
the day the securities are being valued (if there were no sales that day, the   
security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if    
there were no asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at   
the closing bid price on that day). All other portfolio securities for which    
over-the-counter market quotations are readily available are valued at the      
latest average of the bid and asked prices. Portfolio securities traded on more 
than one national securities exchange or market are valued according to the     
broadest and most representative market, as determined by the Adviser. When     
market quotations are not readily available, portfolio securities are valued at 
their fair value as determined in good faith under procedures established by and
under the general supervision of the Board of Directors. Short term debt        
securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized 
cost, unless the Directors determine such does not reflect the securities' fair 
value, in which case these securities will be valued at their fair value as     
determined by the Directors. Debt instruments having a greater maturity are     
valued at the highest bid price obtained from a dealer maintaining an active    
market in those securities. Options are valued at the last sale price on the    
exchange on which they are listed. If no sales of such options have taken place 
that day, they will be valued at the mean between their closing bid and asked   
prices.                                                                         

Repurchase Agreements. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with       
government securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board, with     
member banks of the Federal Reserve System or with other brokers or dealers that
meet credit guidelines established by the Directors. Under the terms of a       
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt   
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. The Fund will always receive and        
maintain securities as collateral whose market value, including accrued         
interest, will be at least equal to 100% of the dollar amount invested by the   
Fund in each agreement. The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon
physical delivery or upon evidence of book entry transfer of the collateral to  
the account of the custodian. To the extent that any repurchase transaction     
exceeds one business day, the value of the

The Gabelli ABC Fund                                                            
Notes to Financial Statements (Continued) (Unaudited)                           
================================================================================

collateral is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the 
collateral. If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or  
if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller of the       
security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  

Futures Contracts. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose of  
hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the     
value of securities it intends to purchase. Upon entering into a futures        
contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or  
cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. This is  
known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuation of the     
value of the contract. The daily changes in the contract are included in        
unrealized gains or losses. The Fund recognizes a realized gain or loss when the
contract is closed. At June 30, 1998, there were no open futures contracts.     

There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as a    
hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds  
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there is the risk that  
the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an      
illiquid secondary market.                                                      

Securities Transactions and Investment Income. Securities transactions are      
accounted for on the trade date with realized gain or loss on investments       
determined by using the identified cost method. Interest income (including      
amortization of premium and accretion of discount) is recorded as earned.       
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.                            

Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders. Dividends and distributions to     
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income distributions and     
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax         
regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.     
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments of income and gains 
on various investment securities held by the Fund, timing differences and       
differing characterization of distributions made by the Fund.                   

For the year ended December 31, 1997, reclassifications were made to increase   
distributions in excess of net investment income for $14,513 and decrease       
undistributed net realized gain on investments for $14,513.                     

Provision for Income Taxes. The Fund has qualified and intends to continue to   
qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal    
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result, a Federal income tax provision is
not required.                                                                   

3. Investment Advisory Agreement. The Fund has entered into an investment       
advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Adviser which provides   
that the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee, computed daily and paid monthly, at   
the annual rate of 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average daily net assets. In
accordance with the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides a continuous       
investment program for the Fund's portfolio, oversees the administration of all 
aspects of the Fund's business and affairs and pays the compensation of all     
Officers and Directors of the Fund who are its affiliates.

4. Distribution Plan. The Fund's Board of Directors has adopted a distribution  
plan (the "Plan") pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. For the six months

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                Closed-end funds carry a certain level of risk for investors.
		 		
				Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through a stock exchange. The Closed-end fund's investment
                return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the
                original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value
                (NAV) of the fund's portfolio.  The market price for a closed-end fund is based on supply and demand which
                fluctuates daily based on many factors, such as economic conditions and global events, investor sentiment, and
                security-specific factors. The possibility of a market decline should be considered market risk.
 				
				There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you can lose money by investing in a
                closed-end fund. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

    Returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower
    or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so, upon
    redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain the most recent month end
    performance information and a prospectus, please call 800-GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com 

	The performance does not reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges.
	Quarterly (Standardized)
    performance reflects the full effect of the front-end sales charge. Other Period Performance does not
    reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges. Please consult your financial advisor
    for prospectus and for more information on mutual fund sales charges.
	
	(a) Total returns and average annual returns reflect changes in share price, reinvestment of distributions,
	and are net of expenses. The net asset value of a Fund is
	reduced on the ex-dividend (payment) date by the amount if the dividend paid. Of course, returns represent
	past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment returns and the principal value of an
	investment will fluctuate. When shares are redeemed they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
	Investing in small capitalization securities involves special challenges because these securities may trade
	less frequently and experience more abrupt price movements than large capitalization securities. Investing
	in micro capitalization securities may involve greater risks than investments in small, medium and large
	capitalization securities because the securities are subject to more abrupt or erratic movements in price.
	Investments in foreign securities involves risks not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic
	issues, including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks. Investing in gold is considered
	speculative and is affected by a variety of worldwide economic, financial and political factors. Funds
	concentrating in specific sectors may experience greater fluctuations in value than funds that are more
	diversified.
	

	(1) Maximum Sales Charge for Class A shares is a percentage of the initial investment and may be
	reduced based on the size of your investment. Class B and C shares have a contingent deferred sales charge
	when you redeem your shares depending on your holding period. Please see the Fund's Prospectus or contact
	your Adviser for a complete description of the applicable sales charge.
	

	(2) Gross Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund reflected as a percentage of the Fund's average
	daily net assets and do not include any voluntary or contractual fee waivers or expense limitations as
	described in the Fund Prospectus.
	

	(3) Net Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund including any voluntary or contractual fee waivers
	or expense limitations as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets. Where applicable, please see
	the Fund's Prospectus or contact your Adviser for a complete description of the fee waiver or expense
	limitation, the effective date and the expiration date.
	
	The Fund's share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund's portfolio securities.
	Stocks are subject to market, economic and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investment
	returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate.  When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth
	less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund.
	

    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before
    investing. The prospectus, which contains more complete information about this and other matters, should be read
    carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, please call 800 GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com .

See page 2 for additional performance information.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CBS. Click here to check it out. CBS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CBSPeter Lynch Chart of CBSValue Investing "Remains Great" StillWhether it was the Chicago Cubs breaking a 108 year curse to bring home a championship, the United Kingdom defying the odds makers in a vote to exit the European Union, or a gilded New York real estate developer turned reality show star capturing the hearts of Rust Belt Americans, and consequently the White House, 2016 certainly qualifies as an unusual year. The world, depending on your perspective, has been turned upside down or right side up. Everything from longstanding political beliefs to consumer preferences for food and entertainment has shifted. In markets, the long bull market in bonds is ending, and Value appears poised to beat Growth for the first time since 2008. Through these tumultuous times, you can rest assured that at least two things will not change: our implementation of fundamental, bottom-up stock research, combined with the time-tested Private Market Value with a CatalystTM methodology, and our commitment to superior client service.The Year In (P)reviewWhile 2016 was marred by continued unrest in the Middle East and terror incidents around the world, the U.S. presidential election dominated the national conscience to such an extent that it impacted football ratings and retail spending. A conclusion to this quadrennial process (some might say ordeal) and greater political certainty would likely have sparked a market rally no matter who was elected, but the 5% rise in the S&P 500 since November 8 has the potential to rank as the largest market post-election move for a new president since the 1961 inauguration of JFK. The so-called "Trump Rally" has been fueled by the potential for increased fiscal stimulus, lower corporate and individual taxes, and deregulation. Taken together, these elements could drive U.S. GDP growth well above 2%, deferring the inevitable end to the current ninety month old expansion.Barron's 2017 RoundtableMario J. Gabelli, our Chief Investment Officer, has appeared in the prestigious Barron's Roundtable discussion annually since 1980. Many of our readers enjoyed the inclusion of selected and edited comments from Barron's Roundtable in previous reports to shareholders. As is our custom, we are including selected comments of Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) from Barron's 2017 Roundtable Part 1 and Part 2, published on January 16 and January 23, 2017, respectively.Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio), head of Gabelli Funds and its parent firm, is a Wall Street legend for good reason. He's a shrewd thematic investor with a love of deals, an eye for steals, and an encyclopedic knowl-edge of multiple businesses and the people who built them.Speaking of opportunities, how about sharing your ideas, Mario?Gabelli: To echo my comments this morning, in electing Donald Trump, the U.S. is moving away from creeping socialism toward the reinvigoration of capitalism. We are seeing a wave of confidence in America, which will spark a wave of innovation. Individual tax rates could fall from 39% to 33%; a new tax plan could create only three tax tiers, and the earned income credit could rise, returning money to the working class. Also, regulatory reform could help improve the tone of business. The U.S. consumer had a record net worth of $105 tril-lion as of September 30. Minus debt, that's $90 trillion. There are two pockets of concern: auto loans are up substantially in the past ten years, and student loans have bal-looned to $1.3 trillion. That's a big drag.That's the macro backdrop. On stocks, I recommended CBS last year and it rose nicely. I expected CBS to buy Viacom (VIAB), but it didn't happen. Viacom has 397 million shares outstanding. About 50 million are Class A, controlled by the Redstone family's NationalAmusements. The rest are Class B. With the B shares around $38, Viacom has an equity valuation of $15 billion. The enterprise value, including debt, is $25 billion. Viacom's Paramount movie studio is a great brand, but it lost about $400 million last year. It must revi-talize its theatrical and television production, and it will. Viacom could also do some creative financ-ing with Paramount - selling assets, entering joint ventures, and such.Viacom's cable TV networks aren't performing well either. How can the company turn those around?Gabelli: The basic business includes Nickelodeon, MTV, and other networks. The new CEO, Bob Bakish, must trim the portfolio and energize product develop-ment. We look for Viacom to report $13 billion of revenue and $3.7 billion of EBITDA in this fiscal year ending September 30. The stock trades for seven times enterprise value to EBITDA. If I'm Apple (AAPL) and want to get into the entertainment business and have a market cap of $600 billion, Viacom wouldn't be hard to buy. But Shari Redstone [president of National Amusements] likely won't sell.Black: Don't you think Viacom is a value trap? It has been depressed for several years.Gabelli: You are correct. The assets weren't managed right by the previous management team. The company's ratings are starting to improve. Viacom stations, in the aggregate, have more viewers than ESPN, notwithstanding mil-lennials' penchant for cord-cutting [cancellation of cable service]. The stock potentially could double in three years. The rules are chang-ing in the media business. The industry will consolidate globally.Schafer: The problems are priced into the stock.Gabelli: Thank you. A year ago Congress passed the FAST Act - Fixing America's Surface Transportation. Stocks like Astec Industries (ASTE) and Gencor Industries (GENC), which make machinery used in highway con-struction, surged. If we get more visibility on infrastructure spending, vendors to industrial companies will do well. We like the rental equipment business, the Uber of the industry. It is a $47 billion busi-ness in the U.S., growing at 4.5% a year.Which stock are you picking?Gabelli: Herc Holdings (HRI), a rental equipment supplier, was spun out of Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ) on July 1, 2016. The company is a work in progress, but should have a significant tail wind if the Trump administration launches a big infrastructure initiative. Herc has an EBITDA margin of 38%. The stock is trading for $40, and the market cap is $1.2 billion. Herc has $2.1 billion of debt, courtesy of Hertz, but it isn't overleveraged.Construction equipment compa-nies also are well positioned. My pick today is CNH Industrial (CNHI), formerly Case New Holland. The company has 1.36 million shares, and the stock is trading for about $9. Exor, the Agnelli family's holding company, controls CNH since its merger with Fiat Industrial in 2013. CNH has a large global presence in the con-struction equipment business. It is also known for farming equipment and engines. Profits have been slim in the construction business, but that could change. CNH recent-ly struck a deal with Hyundai Heavy Industries [009540.Korea Stock Exchange] to make mini excavators. Through the Fiat merger, it owns Iveco, a European truck maker. The class A truck market in Europe is improving. The stock could double in the next two years.About ten years ago, I identified the single-serve coffee market as an exciting growth opportunity.You were hardly alone.billion business, and sparkling water is the fastest growing subset. It is growing by 30% a year. LaCroix gets significant floor space at grocers, and has a 13% market share in its category.Cohen: What are the profit margins on this?Gabelli: Let me give you the math first. The fiscal year ends April 30. National Beverage has been rolling up beverage companies. It bought the Shasta brand - which is popular in the West - and Faygo, and others. Energy drinks are a small part of the business. LaCroix should generate $340 million in revenue this fiscal year, and $90 million of EBITDA, so the profit margin isn't as high as you would expect. The CEO is tax-sensitive. The company declared a dividend of $1.50 a share in late November, but it isn't payable until Jan. 27, after Trump becomes president. If Congress abolishes the estate tax, and the tax on long term capital gains comes down, would he be likely to sell the company? I doubt it. But eventually Coca-Cola (KO) or PepsiCo (PEP) or Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) will knock on the door.Rogers: Is LaCroix nationally distributed?Gabelli: Yes, more or less. National Beverage has significant bottling capacity. LaCroix is their premier brand.LaCroix's revenue could rise to $670 million over the next several years, driving overall revenue to more than $1.1 billion. Shasta is doing okay, and the other brands are small. National Beverage is likely to earn $2 a share this year, rising to $2.45 in the year ending April 2018. Capital expenditure is de minimis, maybe $11 million. The company doesn't put money into trucks or delivery routes.Priest: What is the market cap?Gabelli: Today, I like the prospects for sparkling water -- in particular, National Beverage (FIZZ), which markets LaCroix. The company is based in Florida and has 47 million shares outstanding. The stock sells for $49. The CEO, Nick Caporella, is 80.Sugary soft drinks are perceived to be bad for you, and in some places they're being taxed. But LaCroix has no sugar or additives. Carbonated soft drinks are a $90 Gabelli: It is about $2.5 billion. We look for new products and new channels of distribution. The one I kick myself for is Amazon.com (AMZN). If only we'd known Jeffrey Bezos [Amazon's founder] back when he worked on Wall Street.Moving on to the booze market, known as spirits in the trade, we own Davide Campari-Milano [CPR.Italian Stock Exchange]. It is selling for EUR9.30 and has 580 million shares outstanding. The Garavoglia family owns 50% of the company, but it is professionally managed. Management uses cash flow smartly. Campari will have about EUR2 billion of revenue in the current year. The company owns a number of brands, including Campari, Wild Turkey bourbon, Aperol, and Skyy Vodka. It recently bought Grand Marnier. Campari acquires niche brands globally; they are huge cash generators with high gross profit margins.Give us the numbers, please.Gabelli: In 2017, EBITDA including Grand Marnier could total EUR470 million. The U.S. accounts for 25% of revenue. Italy is also 25%.Next, millennials want experiences; they don't want goods. They are a sharing society. They go to con-certs and other forms of live entertainment. They go to Burning Man and Coachella. Think about Las Vegas, which is undergoing a new life cycle. About 50 years ago, it attracted gamblers. Then it went into the family entertainment busi-ness. Now Las Vegas is a big Standard & Poor's 500. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) and Malone are the two most tax-sensitive CEOs I have ever encountered. Their philoso-phy is pay less, pay later, or pay nothing. Buffett doesn't advertise it, but Malone is upfront about it. Malone has about $7 billion of his own money tied up in Liberty-related companies.Last April, Liberty created a track-ing stock called Liberty Braves Group [BATRK], which represents an investment in the Atlanta Braves. Now you can buy a base-ball team at a discount. Liberty Braves also has a real estate busi-ness that owns 82 acres in Georgia. The stock began trading around $17. It now trades at $20.Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) is another play on interest in live events. Liberty Media owns 35%. Live Nation has 201 million shares; it closed Friday [Jan. 6] at $27. The company has about $1.8 billion in net debt. It is a concert promoter and ticket seller. It owns Ticketmaster. The company could have about $700 million of EBITDA in 2017.Is that all, Mario?Gabelli: Mueller Water Products (MWA) has 161 million shares out-standing, and trades for $13. It has no debt.Witmer: Do you like the manage-ment team?Gabelli: That's why I'm recommending it. They just hired a new CEO from Textron (TXT). He's taking over a company with $800 million of revenue; $200 million comes from fire hydrants, and $500 million from valves. EBITDA is about $275 million, and capex is $25 million to $30 million. Those are the kinds of things I like. Today, the company announced the sale of its Anvil International piping system division.There are so many attractive com-panies when you think about how a 25% tax rate would boost earnings. We expect more corporate take-overs, too. Romance is in the air.Let's leave things there.Thanks, Mario. Corporate tax reform has been on the Washington agenda for many years, but with the Executive and Legislative branches in the hands of one party, it could finally become a reality. With many details to be reconciled, a reduction in corporate tax rates from 35% to 25%, or even lower, combined with a change to the current global system that taxes profits wherever they are earned, should lead to higher earnings. Similarly, a reduction in individual tax brackets and rates has the potential to stoke consumption and increase the incentive for work. Both of these reforms will have to be accompanied by offsetting limits to deductions, including the potential elimination of the deductibility of corporate interest expense, which could have broad consequences and somewhat limit the impact of lower rates. Increased fiscal stimulus, in the form of increased infrastructure and defense spending should also boost GDP growth, but may be limited by Republican concerns about the size of the deficit and the practical scarcity of shovel-ready projects. Finally, a rollback in the regulatory creep of the Obama years seems most assured. A redesign of the healthcare system, a loosening of Dodd-Frank rules governing the banking system, a lighter touch toward Internet regulation, a different approach to domestic energy production and transportation, and a more accommodative vision for anti-trust enforcement appear to have awakened the animal spirits of the business community.Trump as PresidentTrump will make mistakes, as all Presidents do. For better or worse, our federal constitutional system, with the checks and balances of Congress and the courts, and power dispersed through the states modulates change by design. As we witness the evolution of candidate Trump into President-elect Trump, he has gathered some controversial but well-seasoned advisors, and seems humbled by the majesty of the office. Three areas bear continued watching. Protectionism is bad for consumers and businesses alike, but "free" trade is not always "fair" trade, and doesn't mean that the President shouldn't attempt to negotiate better deals with our trading partners. Second, a geopolitical crisis is a near certainty over the next four years - how will Trump balance a desire to project a strong America with a distaste for foreign entanglements? Lastly, it is worth noting that candidates who are populists are usually not unwaveringly pro-business; CEOs in all sectors should be alert for Twitter bombs, the modern form of jawboning, such as those lobbed by the incoming President at the pharmaceutical industry and several defense contractors.Tailwinds and HeadwindsPresident Trump will inherit several interrelated macroeconomic shifts that were already in motion before the election and accentuated by its aftermath: higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and increased inflation expectations. The ten-year U.S. Treasury note rose from a low of 1.4% in July to 2.5% at the time of this writing, while the dollar has strengthened against its trade weighted basket by about 5% over the same time frame. The Federal Reserve has signaled a willingness to raise rates multiple times in 2017. A divergence in monetary policy from still dovish central banks in Europe and Japan, not to mention a fraying of the European Union, will continue to propel the dollar and reduce the competitiveness of U.S. exports, an outcome neither Chairman Janet Yellen nor the new administration will relish. A tightening labor market and the promised fiscal stimulus may however, force the hand of the Fed. With all else equal, higher interest rates and accelerating inflation are bad for all asset classes, including equities. But all else is never equal. The question is whether GDP, and consequently, earnings growth will accelerate enough to overcome the natural governors of higher rates (felt in the form of higher borrowing costs) and inflation (felt in the form of reduced purchasing power). Put simply, earnings estimates for S&P 500 may be revised upward, but may not overcome the pressure of a reduction in the market multiple, which at over 17x is already above historical norms. Much as it is foolish to underestimate the dynamic nature of the economy, one cannot generalize changes in the political economic environment to all industries. This has spurred a "Great Rotation" in the equity market markets, especially since the election, from Growth to Value, non-cyclical to cyclical, and large cap to small cap stocks. To the extent that financial companies are overrepresented in value indices, all of these shifts can be understood as the pendulum swinging to those companies most levered to tax reform and domestic stimulus and least exposed to currency and trade disruptions. Indeed the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google/Alphabet (0.2% of net assets as of December 31, 2016)) that dominated returns in 2015 trail the market slightly this year (up a weighted average ~8.7%) and appear out of favor both in Washington and on Wall Street. What remains to be seen is whether the virtuous (vicious if you are a Value investor) cycle of flows into passive ETFs and these names has been broken.(Y)our Portfolio: Deals, Deals & More DealsWe believe we are generally well positioned for almost any economic environment, including the inflationary one described above. Our holdings tend to be domestically focused, with strong franchises and often pricing power. We have never been top-down allocators trying to chase every trend. Rather, we rely on fundamental bottom-up research, informed by our view of the shifting political economic tides. We purchase and hold securities trading at discounts to their Private Market Values appropriate for their level of risk, and seek to identify one or more catalysts that could close that valuation gap. Industry consolidation, financial engineering (e.g. spin-offs), changes in management, and changes in regulation are just a few catalysts in which the portfolio is rich.2016 in BriefSpinoff activity was healthy in 2016, though down from 2014 and 2015. Notable spinoffs in the portfolio include the separation of Hertz's equipment rental unit (HERC) from the car rental business; the spinoff of Honeywell's (2.7% of net assets as of December 31, 2016) nylon business, AdvanSix; the spinoff of Johnson Controls' (1.0%) automotive interiors business, Adient; and the continued transformation of ConAgra under CEO Sean Connolly, with its spinoff of potato processor Lamb Weston.As could be expected, Dr. John Malone contributed to our list of new securities with the spin-off of Liberty Expedia (0.1%) from Liberty Ventures and the issuance of three new tracker stocks: Liberty SiriusXM (0.8%), representing a 64% stake in SiriusXM radio; Liberty Brave (0.3%), representing ownership of the Atlanta Braves baseball club and related real estate; and Liberty Media (0.1%), accounting for a variety of public and private assets including a 35% stake in Live Nation Entertainment. It is worth noting that prior spins provide fertile ground for deals, as illustrated by the involvement of a spin-off parent or child in so many transactions below.We were the beneficiaries of another strong year of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well. Two deals announced in 2015 involving significant holdings - the long-awaited purchase of Cablevision and Carl Icahn (Trades, Portfolio)'s purchase of Pep Boys - closed during 2016. January began with Johnson Controls agreeing to acquire Tyco International in a $14 billion stock deal. This was followed in February by Apollo's agreement to acquire ADT, the home security spinoff of Tyco, for $42 in cash. Both transactions have closed. Other announced deals include Couche-Tard's $48.53 cash offer for CST Brands (0.6%), the convenience store spinoff of Valero, and German chemical manufacturer Lanxess AG's $33.50 cash offer for Chemtura (0.2%). The biggest merger of the year belongs to AT&T, which, after acquiring satellite distributor DIRECTV from us in 2015, set its sights on leading content producer and serial financial engineer Time Warner (2.5%). AT&T has agreed to pay $107.50 in cash and stock in a transaction that will garner scrutiny in Washington, but we think is likely to succeed. Finally, at the time of this writing, there is speculation that 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway/Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) have identified their next meal in the global food space - Mondelez (1.0%), which was formerly part of 3G's current acquisition vehicle, Kraft-Heinz.In our view, more accommodative regulatory agencies, a potential windfall of repatriated offshore cash, and historically low but prospectively higher interest rates should continue to drive M&A and benefit our style of investing.Investment ScorecardThe largest contributor to performance in 2016 was CBS Corp. (7.6% of net assets as of December 31, 2016) (+25%), which, despite suspending a potential tie-up with Viacom (5.7%), continued to perform very well as a standalone content company under Leslie Moonves. As discussed above, Time Warner (+52%) agreed to be acquired by AT&T for $107.50 in cash and stock and was a strong contributor to performance. Companies exposed to infrastructure investment such as Xylem (2.0%) (+36%), aerospace and defense spending such as Crane Co (1.8%) (+54%) and Honeywell (+15%), and improving energy fundamentals such as Circor (2.0%) (+54%) and National Fuel Gas (2.7%) (+36%) performed well. Finally, despite a pullback late in the fourth quarter, gold miner Newmont Mining (3.2%) (+90%) was up sharply for the year.Detractors from performance included U.S. media companies Viacom (-10%) and AMC Networks (1.1%) (-30%). Mexico-based Grupo Televisa (1.1%) (-23%) and Fomento Economico ("Femsa") (1.1%) (-16%) suffered over concerns about the peso and the outlook for Mexican growth under President Trump. Liberty Interactive (1.1%) (-27%), the owner of multichannel shopping network QVC, suffered its first quarterly sales decline in the U.S. in nearly seven years.Let's Talk StocksThe following are stock specifics on selected holdings of our Fund. Favorable earnings prospects do not necessarily translate into higher stock prices, but they do express a positive trend that we believe will develop over time. Individual securities mentioned are not necessarily representative of the entire portfolio. For the following holdings, the share prices are listed first in United States dollars (USD) and second in the local currency, where applicable, and are presented as of December 30, 2016.CBS Corp.(7.6% of net assets as of December 31, 2016)(CBS-$64.65-NYSE) (CBS) operates the CBS television network and the premium cable network Showtime. It also owns 29 local television stations and 130 radio stations. We believe that CBS has a number of opportunities to generate incremental non-advertising revenue from the sale of existing content through its OTT platforms, online video distributors and retransmission agreements with traditional distributors. In addition, we expect a continued recovery in advertising to contribute to earnings growth. Finally, we believe that financial engineering, including the split-off of its radio business, could act as a catalyst for shares. Honeywell International Inc.(2.7%)(HON-$115.85-NYSE) (HON) operates as a diversified technology company with highly engineered products, including turbine propulsion engines, auxiliary power units, turbochargers, brake pads, environmental and combustion controls, sensors, security and life safety products, resins and chemicals, nuclear services, and process technology for the petrochemical and refining industries. One of the key drivers of HON's growth is acquisitions that increase the company's growth profile globally, creating both organic and inorganic opportunities. The company recently acquired Elster Industries, a leading provider of thermal gas solutions, smart meters, software and data analytics for the commercial, industrial and residential heating market. Elster's gas business offers products in high demand among natural gas customers and brings a strong, global distribution network and numerous cross-selling opportunities for existing HON technologies to new customers. Elster's gas, electric, and water meters are highly valued for their reliability, safety and accuracy. The company maintains an installed base of more than 200 million meter modules deployed over the course of the last 10 years that generate significant recurring revenues. We believe acquisitions such as Elster should drive meaningful and sustained growth for HON spurred by global energy efficiency initiatives and natural resource management.-Mondelez International Inc.(1.0%)(MDLZ - $44.33 -NASDAQ) (MDLZ), headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, is the renamed Kraft Foods Inc. following the tax-free spin-off to shareholders of the North American grocery business on October 1, 2012. Following the contribution of coffee into a new joint venture, nearly 85% of Mondel?z's $27 billion of revenue is derived from snacking, including leading brands such as Oreo, LU and Ritz biscuits, Trident gum, and Cadbury and Milka chocolates. On July 2, 2015 Mondel?z combined its coffee business with D.E Master Blenders 1753 to form a new coffee company, Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Subsequently, MDLZ exchanged part of its stake in this coffee joint venture for 24% ownership in Keurig Green Mountain, which was acquired by an investor group led by JAB Holding Co. in March 2016. This narrows the company's product focus, as only 15% of revenue will be outside snacks -- mostly Tang beverages and other products including Philadelphia cream cheese, which management may look to divest in the future as it executes on its plan to accelerate growth and improve margins in the faster growing snack business. On June 30, Hershey confirmed that it received and rejected a preliminary indication of interest from Mondel?z to acquire Hershey for $107 per share in cash and stock, demonstrating Mondel?z's continued interest in pursuing acquisitions while remaining an independent company.National Fuel Gas Co. (2.7%)(NFG - $56.64 -NYSE)(NFG) is a diversified natural gas company. NFG owns a regulated gas utility serving the region around Buffalo, New York, gas pipelines that move gas between the Midwest and Canada and from the Marcellus to the Northeast, gathering and processing systems, and an oil and gas exploration and production business. NFG's regulated utility and pipeline businesses, as well as its California oil production business, provide stable earnings and cash flows to support the dividend, while the natural gas production business offers significant upside potential. While natural gas prices have been depressed over the past few years, NFG's ownership of 800,000 net acres in Pennsylvania, including 780,000 acres in the Marcellus Shale, holds enormous natural gas reserve potential and the company has proven to be among the lower cost producers. We continue to expect above average long term earnings and cash flow growth from improving gas prices, growing gas production and strategically located pipeline expansion. The company has increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years. In addition, NFG is considering corporate restructuring alternatives, including an MLP of its midstream assets. Sony Corp. (3.2%)(SNE-$28.03-NYSE)(SNE) is a diversified electronics and entertainment company based in Tokyo, Japan. The company manufactures televisions, PlayStation game consoles, mobile phone handsets, and cameras. It also operates the Columbia film studio and Sony Music entertainment group. We expect the new PlayStation launch and operational improvements in consumer electronics and entertainment to generate EBITDA growth through 2018. We also think the spinoff of the entertainment assets could be a catalyst.Time Warner Inc. (2.5%) (TWX - $96.53 - NYSE) (TWX), located in New York, New York, is a diversified media company with operations in cable networks through HBO, TNT, TBS & CNN, and film & television production. We like the company's cable networks, high margins and low capital intensity. We believe the AT&T-Time Warner transaction will close, and expect limited downside were the government to block the deal.Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.(1.3%)(FOXA-$28.04-NASDAQ) (FOXA),(0.5%)(FOX-$27.25-NASDAQ) is a diversified media company with operations in cable network television, television broadcasting, filmed entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite television. Cable networks account for 70% of the company's EBITDA, and benefit from contractually recurring affiliate fees and exposure to the fast growing global pay television market. We also expect the company to benefit from rising demand for premium content, driven by emerging distribution platforms such as Netflix, retransmission revenue, and aggressive share repurchases.Viacom Inc.(5.7%)(VIA-$38.50-NASDAQ)(VIA) is a pure-play content company that owns a global stable of cable networks, including MTV, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, VH1, BET, and the Paramount movie studio. Viacom's cable networks generate revenue from advertising sales, fixed monthly subscriber fees, and ancillary revenue from toy licensing, etc. We believe a low valuation and M&A potential outweigh the secular risks of cord-cutting.Xylem Inc.(2.0%)(XYL-$49.52-NYSE)(XYL) is a global leader in the design, manufacturing, and application of highly engineered technologies for the transportation, treatment, measurement, and testing of water. The company is expected to benefit from favorable long term fundamentals in the water industry, driven by scarcity, population growth, aging of the infrastructure, and the need to improve water quality.
