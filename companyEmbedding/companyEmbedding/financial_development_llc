                Lead The Charge With Product Development            


    By Christina Granville 






Share















































The area of product development is an important one in financial services and it is specifically crucial when it comes to investment management. Determining what asset management fund products will be released, in what countries and at which times are pivotal decisions for any firm. Those in product development are often the ones who make to the final decision on which asset management products their investors will have to choose from and their pricing structure. If you've got your ear to the floor regarding what's new and what could be a big hit, then this may be the career for you.
The Role of Product Development In seeking to launch new products, those in the product development department often search for gaps in the product lines. When a new fund is in the process of being established, those in product development work with the legal and compliance teams to make sure the investment vehicle meets all regulatory and legal requirements. They also work closely with the marketing and sales departments to craft the promotional material for the new investment product. (For more on this process, read On The Record: Communications With The Public.)
The product development team also plays a role in assessing competitors' products. This allows the team to ensure that their firm's products are adequately positioned to compete effectively. As a result of their competitive intelligence, they will often make recommendations when it comes to merging or eliminating funds, and setting the pricing of funds. (Keep reading on this subject in Where do most fund managers get their market information?)
Product Development: What It TakesWhile staffers in product development often have experience in other areas of investment management, entry-level positions do open up from time to time depending on the company. If you are an undergraduate student considering a career in investment management product development, you might want to consider taking courses in economics, accounting, math and marketing. A graduate MBA degree is always looked favorably upon by investment management firms. Even if you don't have an MBA, however, enrolling in the CFA or the CAIA programs may also be helpful.
The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program, offered by the CFA Institute, consists of three levels of tests that you can study for independently. Passing all three levels, in addition to gaining four years of eligible work experience and completing a professional conduct statement, will earn you the CFA charter. Because this charter is so hard to earn, it is a highly regarded emblem of knowledge within the investment community. (To read more on obtaining the CFA Charter, see Pass Your CFA Exams The First Time and So, You Want To Earn Your CFA?)
The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) program offers a curriculum focused on alternative investments. The specialized CAIA program has two levels of exams that cover hedge fund and private equity investment products as well as real estate, managed futures and commodity products. The CAIA designation is conferred by the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association upon those who complete the program and have at least one year of professional experience. 
Developing Offshore ProductsEither the CFA or the CAIA designations could be of great value within an offshore product development department. Offshore product development focuses on the launch, sale and marketing of funds off the domestic shore of the United States. Legal regulations vary considerably in different countries and offshore product development staffers must work carefully with legal and compliance departments to make certain that the funds are compliant for each country in which they are issued. Sales and marketing approaches must also be tweaked depending upon the country in which the investment vehicle is issued - especially when a particular country has important cultural traits to consider when determining successful marketing and sales strategies. 
Some staffers within product development choose to specialize in offshore marketing due to these compelling challenges. However, when you are first hired with a product development department, you will generally learn the ropes of domestic product marketing - or the practice of developing fund products sold within the confines of the United States - before moving on to offshore investment vehicles. (For related reading, see Pros And Cons Of Offshore Investing.)
What To Expect A day in the life of a product development staffer is varied, complex and incredibly up to date. As with most in the investment fields, those in product development tend to start the day by reading The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, watching CNBC and financial news shows, and perusing online forums and sites that discuss current financial events and developments.
A member of a product development staff may have an early morning meeting with the legal department in order to go over the prospectus for the launch of a new fund. Right after that meeting, there may be a similar gathering within the compliance department in order to go over compliance issues with that same fund that is due to launch in the near future.
Over lunch, the product development department may informally eat together in order to compare notes and discuss the latest developments on fund launches. The afternoon may bring meetings with the sales and marketing departments in order to discuss another investment vehicle that has recently launched. Topics might be on the collateral required to sell the fund, or briefing the sales force on the best way to position the sale of the fund with potential investors.
Finally, before the staffer heads home that day, he or she may pour over competitor pricing data in order to consider a pricing strategy for a new fund product about to launch. Some of these reports may find their way into the staffer's briefcase to continue to assess over dinner or at home.
Pursuing the Product Development DreamProduct development is a challenging - but ultimately rewarding - career path within an investment management firm. Those in product development have their fingers on the pulse of exciting new fund launches and are integral in developing the strategies behind new products. If you like the idea of being at the center of this storm, you might want to consider a career in product development.
If you're not interested in product development, but would like to still pursue a financial career, see Finding Your Place In The Financial Industry.

 Job Description of a Product Manager in Financial Services | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  Job Description of a Product Manager in Financial Services  by Harlow Keith        A product manager will often pitch new products or services to potential investors. Keith Brofsky/Photodisc/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Financial Services Sector] | Interviewing Tips for the Financial Services Sector 2 [Financial Services Sales] | Job Description of a Financial Services Sales Representative 3 [Credit Manager] | The Role of a Credit Manager in a Bank 4 [Financial Services] | Pros & Cons of a Career in Financial Services    A product manager working in the financial services industry is in charge of developing a strategy to sell a product. This involves planning and assisting in the development, marketing and distribution of a product. Product managers also have to provide a clear plan for their product, outlining goals as well as potential risks, challenges and opportunities. They play a very active role within a company, leading and motivating teams to achieve their desired outcomes.        Educational Requirements Product managers who work in the financial services industry have at least a bachelorâs degree in finance, marketing, business management or another related field of study. Many individuals have a masterâs degree in business administration, however. This position requires an extensive knowledge of finance and marketing, so you'll need a strong background in both fields. Many product managers in the financial services industry possess skills in accounting to help them balance budgets. Skills and Experience In order to be a product manager in financial services, you'll need at least five years of experience in a finance or management role, although most employers prefer more. Moreover, you'll need strong teamwork skills and the ability to inspire your fellow team members. Project managers have the necessary time and project management skills in order to complete their projects in a timely manner. Finally, you'll need to be able to use spreadsheets to analyze financial data and predict future costs, revenues and profits. Primary Responsibilities The principal duty of a product manager in financial services is to develop a strategy from inception to completion of a product. You'll have to work with the design and engineering teams to develop the product, the marketing team to effectively market the product and outside vendors to distribute and sell your product. Along the way, you'll have to complete financial analysis to model the productâs cost and potential margin. In addition, you'll be in charge of driving different teams and departments to make sure you achieve all of your initial goals. Additional Duties While developing your product, you'll also have to present your strategy to partners and shareholders. You'll outline how you plan to achieve your objective and lay out the potential risks and opportunities. Product managers in financial services regularly meet with clients about their interests. Furthermore, you may have to pitch your product to third-party vendors. All of these responsibilities will require strong communication skills. You may have to travel often in order to meet with customers and potential clients.

Our Heritage










Kay R. Shirley,
          
          Ph.D., CFPÂ®
        

Original Founder




Dr. Kay Shirley is the founder of Financial Development Corporation and the career mentor of Jody Owenby. They began working together in 1988 building a business dedicated not only to advising people how to invest their hard-earned money but also teaching them the positives and negatives of different approaches to investing.
      
Dr. Shirley, a former teacher and management consultant, is recognized as having achievements in the financial services arena over many years. Among those recognitions are the August 2010 Registered Rep magazine which lists Dr. Shirley as number 13 out of 100 Top Independent Broker/Dealer Financial Advisors, based on assets under management. In addition, the June 2010 Barronâs magazine lists Dr. Shirley among the Top 100 Women advisors in the nation. In the February 2011 Barronâs magazine listing, Dr. Shirley was #17 among the Top 25 Financial Advisors in Georgia, and the only female on the Georgia list. For every year since 2004 Dr. Shirley and Financial Development Corporation have been listed by Barronâs magazine in their lists of Top Women Financial Advisors and Top Independent Financial Advisors. Factors included in the rankings: assets under management, revenue produced for the firm, client satisfaction, regulatory record, and philanthropic work.
      
She earned her B.S. in Mathematics from Mississippi State University and Ph.D. in Educational Administration and Management from Georgia State University. The author of two books, Dr. Shirley presented on many financial talk shows and often spoke to civic, community and religious groups.
      
Following her stroke in January 2011, Dr. Shirley sold her practice to Jody Owenby, her planned successor. She works exhaustively to recover, and the legacy she left still influences our business.

      Kay Shirley is no longer affiliated with LPL Financial.Â

Poor and low income people lead extremely complex financial lives. Portfolios of the Poor vividly shows this by letting us into the homes of 250 families across three countries through financial diaries.This study and subsequent ones showed that finance, currently mostly informal, is useful to fulfill multiple objectives and aspirations. Some are daily, short-term, and mundaneâput food on the table or renew stock for petty trading activities. For this, access to finance helps to smooth the often highly irregular income streams of the poor. Another need is to build some resilience to the shocks that life invariably brings, so financial tools that help with risk management, such as insurance, are important. Enabling families to build assets for investment in the home, businesses or human capital is another common use of finance. And access to finance can help foster peace of mind, allowing people to plan for the future.With such a variety of evolving needs over the life of a client, it is clear that one rigid product cannot respond to them all. And yet, with some important exceptions, the main offer of microfinance to date has been microcredit.Developing a broader range of quality, transparent, and affordable financial servicesâinformed by client needsâis an imperative of financial inclusion today. The G-20, national policymakers, providers, and donors all agree that people should have access to: savings, payments, credit, and insurance.Ensuring the availability of a broader range of products is not just good for clients. It can also be good for the financial service providers. Responding to client needs with the right range of products will help ensure that providers can deepen their client relationships, broaden market share, grow responsibly, and reduce their own risk.The need for a diverse range of products is not new, but most providers have taken a long time to move beyond a single, simple credit product. Many financial service providers have built their business model around a credit offering, rather than exploring ways to offer a full set of services that their clients would find useful over time. New ways of thinking about the business case for a diverse offering to low income clients are needed. One study showed that savings can be profitable for microfinance institutions if they make deposit services part of a broader offering.There are at least three core requirements to unleashing innovations in product development.Incentives: Management and boards of directors are often reluctant to invest in research and development when the core business is still growing. Incentives from investors for growth and high returns, often within a short-time frame, can also stymie innovation and risk appetite. Running a business while innovating may be hard, but it is essential for any business to survive.Organizational Capacity: The relative lack of innovation on products is not just an issue of incentive. Capacity is also needed. Integrating systematic ways to listen to and learn from clients to inform product development must be a priority for providers, and it requires management buy-in. Though this can be done in-house, the culture and skills needed to run the current business are often different from the entrepreneurial mindset needed to source and act on client insights. One option is to bring in an outside firm to conduct market research and provide insights and ideas for products. Leveraging the expertise of specialists can bring fresh perspective and be highly effective. Another approach entails establishing product innovation labs or committees within a financial service provider that run as independent entities.Regulatory Environment: Besides the issues of organizational capacity and incentives, new product development can also be greatly affected by local regulations. In some markets, there is either a legal vacuum, high barriers to entry, or express restriction to offering diverse services. For example, in many parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, microfinance providers are prohibited from mobilizing deposits. For product innovation to flourish, the regulatory environment must allow for, and encourage, the development of new product approaches to financial inclusion.Topic Contact: Tanaya Kilara, Claudia McKayRecommended Reading:Human Centered Design Toolkit (IDEO)Toolkit: Pilot Testing for Savings Products (MicroSave)

New Product Development
The new product development process for services industries differs from manufactured goods in more ways than the obvious differences in end products. And for the financial services industry, there are additional challenges beyond the minimal requirements of innovation.

For example, Merrill Lynch altered the competitive landscape of the then heavily regulated banking and securities industries through the innovation of cash management accounts (CMAs). Merrill Lynch saw a market opportunity for integrating all of a customer's assets (i.e., checking, savings, and brokerage) under one umbrella. They created a solution that met customer needs while complying with the complex regulatory standards of the day. Today, many financial services institutions offer CMA services, but only Merrill Lynch reaped the rewards of first mover advantage. Creating offers that change the industry landscape is both an art and a science. Creating and maintaining competitive advantage in today's more challenging conditions requires vision, innovation, and a strong business process management solution.

Companies have discovered many additional opportunities since Merrill's innovationâvariable rate mortgages, open end and closed end mutual funds, as well as hedge, venture, and derivative fundsâbut it's not often that we see inventions of the CMA magnitude, After all, if it were easy, everyone would do it. Having business processes in place that enable you to take advantage of these opportunities and be the first to market is a powerful competitive weapon.
...::Â ::Â ::Â ::Â ::Â ::...
Recently the market has experienced two additional offers poised to change the competitive landscape in the same revolutionary way that Merrill Lynch's CMAs did. The first is by Swiss Reinsurance with ManageReinsurance. Swiss Re's global renewal application is a cross-corporate industry operating system that creates a seamless negotiation process between insurers, Swiss Reinsurance and third party property/casualty experts. It is the first time that complex, multi-party agreements among multiple companies have been brought together into a single unified process. The second is from a subsidiary of Halifax plc, Intelligent Finance for Integrated Assets and Liabilities Management. Intelligent Finance, the fastest growing bank in the United Kingdom, and likely all of Europe, has discovered a way to create additional value for its customers and become a major player in the financial services industry by taking Merrill Lynch's CMA concept to the next level and offering integrated asset and liability management. The bank's solution allows customers to fully use all credits from asset accounts against all debits from liability accounts. Thus, for many Intelligent Finance customers, their monthly interest credits fully pay for their monthly mortgage. 

Swiss Reinsurance's ManageReinsurance and Intelligent Finance's Integrated Assets and Liabilities Management are core processes that are transforming the industry and giving their respective organizations significant competitive advantage. Both are experiencing rapid gains in market share because of their innovations and the processes they use to turn ideas into recurring actions that benefit customers. It's not surprising then, given Action's unique ability to enable companies to manage their complex, high value decision-processes that require negotiation, commitment and flexibility, that both solutions are managed by ActionWorks.

Companies attempt to create competitive advantage in many ways; new product development is one of them. In finance, new product development is the orchestrated effort to invent the new offer, gain regulatory approval, implement the systems, and, finally, establish the business processes that enable a company to deliver this value to its customersâwhile being faster to market than the competition, and at costs lower than "copycat" firms. While the responsibility for creating new offers may reside with a particular group within a financial services organization, it requires the coordinated effort of nearly every department across the organization (e.g., customers, suppliers, and marketing, legal, analysis, services, and other departments). ActionWorks links the hundreds of people who need to plan, invent, negotiate, and commit new product development process flows seamlessly, from the institution to suppliers and customers, from department to department, and from person to person, while being executed 40 to 60 percent faster than previously. Action's unique abilities to support processes requiring planning, invention, mobilization, and commitment is the reason that dozens of world-class financial services companies use our software to manage their mission-critical processes.

       Financial Products - African Development Bank                                       MenuSearchLanguageEnglishFranÃ§aisSite searchSearch keyword(s): SearchHomeProjects & OperationsFinancial Products         Financial ProductsIn this sectionAs a multilateral development finance institution, the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group seeks to further the social and economic well-being of its regional member countries. To attain this objective, the Bank uses the leverageÂ  afforded by its AAA rating to on-lend to its borrower countries, at favorable terms, resources raised in international capital markets.  Up until 1997, only one loan product, the multi-currency variable rate loan (VLR), was offered by the Bank. The shift to a more dynamic multi-product institution that took place that year was predicated on the desire to increase flexibility and choice.  The Bankâs lending environment was made more responsive to the borrower countriesâ varied and evolving needs. With the introduction of single currency loans, borrowers were given the option to choose from a number of currencies readily available to the Bank, including the South African Rand, along with three interest rate bases. Since 2000, the AfDB offers its borrowers flexibility to customize their debt repayment profile with access to annuities, step-up or step-down amortization of principal or bullet repayment. These features enable sophisticated borrowers to profile their loans to fit their specific needs.  Flexibility and freedom of choice, again, are the main thrust of the introduction in 2002 of a range of Risk Management Products including interest rate and currency swaps, caps, collars, commodity hedges and indexed loans enabling borrowers to manage risks occurring during the life of a given loan. These hedging instruments allow borrowers to better manage the financial risks associated with their ADB loans, to access market-based hedging tools using the Bank as an intermediary, and to actively manage their AfDB debt portfolio.  With the introduction of guarantees in 2004, the Bank has opened up a new window of opportunity for borrowers who want to access resources from third-party lenders, including capital markets. Guarantees are also an effective tool for encouraging local currency borrowing.  On 9 December 2009, Board of Directors of the Bank approved several amendments to the menu of the Bankâs financial products.
