Asset Management - Perella Weinberg Partners





















































Skip to content




From Insight, Opportunity
Sophisticated investors turn to Perella Weinberg Partners for distinct alternative investment solutions.







PWP is a leading global institutional asset manager with an unwavering focus on investors’ needs.
We derive an “investment edge” through harnessing the brightest investment minds around the globe. Across investment strategies, we achieve our objectives of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns in a variety of market environments because of our experience, expertise, and disciplined investment approach. Our investors benefit from this edge across public and private instruments, spanning equity, credit, and real asset investments, both through our direct alternatives and our outsourced CIO capabilities. Today PWP oversees approximately $13.1 billion in assets under management.





Agility / Your Outsourced Investment Solution
Overview
PWP created the Agility platform to provide your organization an Outsourced Investment Team with comprehensive capabilities that can offer customized programs to meet your individual investment requirements. Our team of professionals has decades of experience and executes a proven and disciplined due diligence process to identify and invest with top managers across asset classes.
Value Proposition
Today, the investment landscape is global and more complex than ever. At many institutions, investment management is often under-resourced, and attracting and retaining specialized in-house investment talent is both difficult and expensive. To be an effective fiduciary now requires an institutional approach involving investment, risk management, legal, compliance, and operational expertise. With Agility, PWP can serve as an extension of your staff or volunteer board and offer customized investment programs designed to complement the remainder of your portfolio.
Approach
The Agility platform’s success is ultimately built upon a close, strategic partnership between you and the Agility Investment Team. With a long-term horizon, we construct diversified portfolios by investing across geographies, asset classes, managers, and positions. We use a detailed, proprietary methodology as well as internal and external tools to measure and manage risk in your portfolio. Combined with the support of experienced legal, compliance, risk management, trading and operational teams, we create a customized investment program to complement and enhance your portfolio.

Asset Based Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy emphasizes capital preservation and cash flow generation from assets purchased at attractive current cash yields and equity-like upside optionality.
Strategy Overview
Our Asset Based Opportunities strategy seeks to uncover mispriced asset based investment opportunities through fundamental analysis and in-depth understanding of asset valuation.
Current market dislocation, including illiquidity, repricing of assets, deleveraging, and regulatory changes, create compelling asset based investment opportunities.
Assets targeted for investment are real assets, including rail cars, aircrafts, vessels, working interests in oil and gas, and commercial real estate and financial assets, including auto loans, credit card loans, franchise loans and equipment lending, small business loans, and other consumer assets.




Diversified Equities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy represents a combination of tactical long/short equity investing and event-driven equity investing within the context of a diversified, low-net portfolio of mid and large cap equities.
Strategy Overview
In the short to medium term the fundamental drivers of stocks can often be diluted or even overridden by other influencers of stock prices such as technicals, macro/thematic factors and behavioral sentiment. As a result, PWP has developed an iterative ‘multiple-lens’ approach that takes into account all of these considerations in developing portfolio construction and managing risk.
To achieve its objective, the strategy invests in both select long and short equity opportunities and event-driven opportunities with a hard catalyst. The strategy leverages significant knowledge synergies between the two strategies and maintains a flexible investment mandate across such strategies in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by the market.

Global Macro
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is highly liquid, investing in equity indices, currencies, sovereign debt, credit, and commodities with a strong focus on risk management in an effort to limit the frequency and severity of drawdowns.
Strategy Overview
The investment strategy is based on fundamental macro-economic research to establish predictive relationships between macro-economic factors and asset returns. These principles are implemented in a rigorous, systematic investment framework. The goal of the strategy is to estimate the dynamics of risk premia across all liquid assets globally in order to identify opportunities to deploy risk to maximize reward. The investment approach incorporates analysis of the current economic environment as well as prediction of the evolution of the business cycle across multiple regions.

Growth Equity
Investment Philosophy
PWP Growth Equity is a private equity group focused on growth-oriented, lower middle market companies across the consumer/retail, services and industrial sectors, primarily in the United States.

Strategy Overview
This strategy is in a small universe of hedged, liquid strategies that invests in the energy infrastructure space. The strategy employs an actively managed portfolio with alpha longs and shorts and proactive hedging to isolate desired exposures and reduce broader energy sector, market, and macro risks.
The strategy seeks to exploit opportunities in the North American energy sector, with a focus on the energy infrastructure spectrum (i.e., midstream/MLP, pipelines, electric and gas utilities, water, transmission, commodity storage, gathering and processing), through investments in liquid, publicly traded securities.

TPH Private Energy Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is a merchant-banking style private equity strategy that makes primarily minority stake, non-control investments in companies across the energy industry.
Strategy Overview
This strategy invests in opportunities that provide capital solutions to companies with attractive risk / return profiles during the current energy correction.  Seeded by one of the largest pension funds in the US, the strategy taps into the proprietary deal flow generated across the TPH platform (Advisory, Capital Markets. and Asset Management) to source attractive investment opportunities. The strategy has three targeted investment scenarios in which it seeks to deploy capital: trough-cycle investment opportunities, development opportunities, and structured opportunities.  The strategy’s opportunistic mandate provides a tactical allocation to energy private equity during the most difficult energy environment since the 1980s.



Investment Committee: Dan Pickering, Chansoo Joung, Bobby Tudor

Asset Management - Perella Weinberg Partners

From Insight, Opportunity
Sophisticated investors turn to Perella Weinberg Partners for distinct alternative investment solutions.







PWP is a leading global institutional asset manager with an unwavering focus on investors’ needs.
We derive an “investment edge” through harnessing the brightest investment minds around the globe. Across investment strategies, we achieve our objectives of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns in a variety of market environments because of our experience, expertise, and disciplined investment approach. Our investors benefit from this edge across public and private instruments, spanning equity, credit, and real asset investments, both through our direct alternatives and our outsourced CIO capabilities. Today PWP oversees approximately $13.1 billion in assets under management.





Agility / Your Outsourced Investment Solution
Overview
PWP created the Agility platform to provide your organization an Outsourced Investment Team with comprehensive capabilities that can offer customized programs to meet your individual investment requirements. Our team of professionals has decades of experience and executes a proven and disciplined due diligence process to identify and invest with top managers across asset classes.
Value Proposition
Today, the investment landscape is global and more complex than ever. At many institutions, investment management is often under-resourced, and attracting and retaining specialized in-house investment talent is both difficult and expensive. To be an effective fiduciary now requires an institutional approach involving investment, risk management, legal, compliance, and operational expertise. With Agility, PWP can serve as an extension of your staff or volunteer board and offer customized investment programs designed to complement the remainder of your portfolio.
Approach
The Agility platform’s success is ultimately built upon a close, strategic partnership between you and the Agility Investment Team. With a long-term horizon, we construct diversified portfolios by investing across geographies, asset classes, managers, and positions. We use a detailed, proprietary methodology as well as internal and external tools to measure and manage risk in your portfolio. Combined with the support of experienced legal, compliance, risk management, trading and operational teams, we create a customized investment program to complement and enhance your portfolio.

Asset Based Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy emphasizes capital preservation and cash flow generation from assets purchased at attractive current cash yields and equity-like upside optionality.
Strategy Overview
Our Asset Based Opportunities strategy seeks to uncover mispriced asset based investment opportunities through fundamental analysis and in-depth understanding of asset valuation.
Current market dislocation, including illiquidity, repricing of assets, deleveraging, and regulatory changes, create compelling asset based investment opportunities.
Assets targeted for investment are real assets, including rail cars, aircrafts, vessels, working interests in oil and gas, and commercial real estate and financial assets, including auto loans, credit card loans, franchise loans and equipment lending, small business loans, and other consumer assets.




Diversified Equities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy represents a combination of tactical long/short equity investing and event-driven equity investing within the context of a diversified, low-net portfolio of mid and large cap equities.
Strategy Overview
In the short to medium term the fundamental drivers of stocks can often be diluted or even overridden by other influencers of stock prices such as technicals, macro/thematic factors and behavioral sentiment. As a result, PWP has developed an iterative ‘multiple-lens’ approach that takes into account all of these considerations in developing portfolio construction and managing risk.
To achieve its objective, the strategy invests in both select long and short equity opportunities and event-driven opportunities with a hard catalyst. The strategy leverages significant knowledge synergies between the two strategies and maintains a flexible investment mandate across such strategies in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by the market.

Global Macro
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is highly liquid, investing in equity indices, currencies, sovereign debt, credit, and commodities with a strong focus on risk management in an effort to limit the frequency and severity of drawdowns.
Strategy Overview
The investment strategy is based on fundamental macro-economic research to establish predictive relationships between macro-economic factors and asset returns. These principles are implemented in a rigorous, systematic investment framework. The goal of the strategy is to estimate the dynamics of risk premia across all liquid assets globally in order to identify opportunities to deploy risk to maximize reward. The investment approach incorporates analysis of the current economic environment as well as prediction of the evolution of the business cycle across multiple regions.

Our Principles
We are devoted to providing unmatched advisory and asset management services to clients based on high quality independent, financial expertise. Our Business Principles are our values and articulate the Firm’s culture and how we engage with clients. Our entire culture is predicated on trust and experience. Our professionals share an uncompromised dedication to excellence and integrity worldwide.

Business Principles

Clients are everything to us. When we engage with an advisory or investing client, we agree not only to represent them, but to fight for them if the circumstances require it.
We are an entrepreneurial and nimble Firm, unencumbered by bureaucracy and politics. We should use this advantage in every way possible, both internally and externally.
Transparency is vital to our identity, our culture and our success. Complex problems are a prominent feature of our industry and are best solved by early warning, open discussion and a sharing of ideas.
We embrace diversity, not merely because it’s right, but because it creates the most interesting, vibrant and commercial environment.
“I trust you” is the highest compliment we can receive from an advisory client, an investor or a colleague. We should aspire to be the most trusted Firm in our industry.
It takes a special kind of person to enjoy and prosper in our Firm. Our people succeed through their wits, their experience, their relationships and their creativity; without the benefit of armies of people or a huge balance sheet.
While our business model hinges on having experienced senior people with exceptional reputations, our more junior people are the lifeblood of the Firm. We cannot be successful without fully developing the next generation to take the place of the current partners.
Our partnership extends beyond our partners. Every person in the Firm should be devoted, first and foremost, to the Firm’s reputation and well-being. Self-centered or “silo” behavior is antithetical to who we are.
At our Firm, personal ambition and teamwork go hand in hand. Let’s always venerate individual creativity and drive, mindful that each of us, and therefore the Firm, performs most effectively when we operate in a collegial manner.
Every day, we have an obligation to protect, uphold and enhance our reputation.

 Morgan Stanley and Perella Weinberg Partners Capital Management LP Launch UCITS FundFund launched on Morgan Stanley’s FundLogic Alternatives Plc Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) today announced the launch of a new fund under its UCITS Irish Umbrella, FundLogic Alternatives Plc. The MS Perella Weinberg Partners Tōkum Long/Short Healthcare UCITS Fund will be managed by Perella Weinberg Partners, an independent financial services firm with approximately US$8.2 billion of assets under management.  The new fund will offer access to a global long/short equity strategy focused on the healthcare industry (including biotechnologies, pharmaceuticals and companies engaged in the medical technology and services businesses) and will seek attractive risk-adjusted returns.  David Armstrong, Managing Director and Global Head of the Fund and Fund-Linked business at Morgan Stanley commented: “In less than a year of running our FundLogic Alternatives Platform, we have successfully put to market a wide range of alternative strategies in a UCITS format, with programs covering long/short equity, event-driven and convertible arbitrage. The launch of the MS Perella Weinberg Partners Tōkum Long/Short Healthcare UCITS Fund adds an outstanding option to gain exposure to a new sector focused strategy. We look forward to our partnership with Perella Weinberg Partners to offer investors a new route to capture the evolutions of the healthcare industry.”  Greth Lester, responsible for overseeing Perella Weinberg Partners’ investor relations and asset management business in Europe, commented: “We are delighted to collaborate with Morgan Stanley, one of the leading providers of alternative strategies in a UCITS format, for the launch of the MS Perella Weinberg Partners Tōkum Long/Short Healthcare UCITS Fund. Morgan Stanley has an impressive track-record of successfully launching alternative UCITS strategies, which we believe will further enhance our European presence and provide new opportunities to investors in search of an attractive absolute return profile focusing on long/short healthcare opportunities.”  Emile Westergaard, Portfolio Manager of the MS Perella Weinberg Partners Tōkum Long/Short Healthcare UCITS Fund, added: “The MS Perella Weinberg Partners Tōkum Long/Short Healthcare UCITS Fund will leverage our team’s bottom-up fundamental research process to identify, within the healthcare industry’s rapidly evolving technological and regulatory frameworks, material levers impacting businesses positively or negatively over a two to four-year horizon. We strongly believe our unique portfolio construction matrix, which has been developed to take into account a multi-factored set of inputs guided by absolute return objectives, implied volatility targets and liquidity requirements, fits well within the UCITS framework.”  FundLogic is the platform brand name for Morgan Stanley fund solutions launched in 2006. It can offer both UCITS and non-UCITS Funds on a global basis. The platform delivers fund solutions to clients by combining the financial expertise, innovation and resources of Morgan Stanley and offers a range of products including simple Index Funds, Structured Funds and the more recently launched Third Party managers UCITS Funds.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
