IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE ROAD MARSHALL SERVICE.
THE USER TERMS ARE INTENDED FOR ALL USERS OF THE ROAD MARSHALL SERVICE, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE SIMPLY NAVIGATING THE WEBSITE OR THOSE WHO REGISTER AN ACCOUNT. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE USER TERMS AFFECT USERS DIFFERENTLY, SO PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY.
1. ROAD MARSHALL Service Overview.

                                ROAD MARSHALL provides an online platform whereby users can connect with vendors who offer roadside assistance and tow services (hereafter, “Providers”). Users can access the ROAD MARSHALL Service through the use of the Road MarshallForHelp.com website or ROAD MARSHALL mobile application and can be accessed by you on your single mobile device (smart phone) or computer. ROAD MARSHALL is not directly involved in or otherwise a party to any transactions that may take place between users and Providers. ROAD MARSHALL has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of any aspect of Providers’ services or offerings or any claims made by Providers about the services they offer, the truth or accuracy of warranties or pricing supplied by Providers to ROAD MARSHALL, the ability of Providers to provide the services offered, or the ability of users to pay for Provider’s services. ROAD MARSHALL does not conduct background checks regarding any users or Providers. ROAD MARSHALL is not a broker, agent or insurer for any users or Providers. ROAD MARSHALL makes no representations, warranties or guarantees regarding any content or information provided by users or Providers. We encourage you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available through the ROAD MARSHALL Services. All purchases made by users from Providers are made at each party’s own risk. ROAD MARSHALL has customer information and privacy policies as set forth in its Privacy Policy http://Road Marshallforhelp.com/privacy-policy/, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.
2. Registration for ROAD MARSHALL Service.

                                Registration with the ROAD MARSHALL Service is subject to the following additional terms and conditions:
(a) Eligibility: By registering with ROAD MARSHALL, you represent and warrant that all registration information you submit, including, without limitation, your first and last name, mobile telephone number, vehicle information (make, model, year, etc.), and credit card or financial account payment information is completely accurate and truthful. ROAD MARSHALL may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer access to or use of the ROAD MARSHALL Services to any party and change the eligibility criteria at any time. By registering with ROAD MARSHALL, you represent that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to enter into a binding contract and that if you are registering on behalf of a legal entity, that you are authorized to enter into, and bind the entity to, these User Terms and register for the ROAD MARSHALL Service.
(b) Security of Registration Information: You are solely responsible for maintaining the security and correctness of your registration information. You are fully responsible for all activity, liability and damage resulting from your failure to maintain password confidentiality. You agree to immediately notify ROAD MARSHALL of any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security. You also agree that ROAD MARSHALL shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure.
(c) Compliance: You agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content. In addition, you must abide by our policies as stated in the User Terms as well as all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time via the ROAD MARSHALL Service, each of which is incorporated herein by reference and each of which may be updated by ROAD MARSHALL from time to time without notice to you.
3. How to use the ROAD MARSHALL Service.

                                The ROAD MARSHALL Service offers you a platform to send a request for roadside assistance or tow services to a Provider. The GPS receiver, which should be installed on the mobile device (smart phone), or Internet Protocol address on your computer, requests your permission to detect your location and sends your location information to the relevant Provider. The Provider has sole and complete discretion to accept or reject each request for service. The Provider also has sole and complete discretion over whether to use the ROAD MARSHALL Service to receive the leads generated through the ROAD MARSHALL platform. If the Provider accepts a request, the ROAD MARSHALL mobile application notifies you and provides information regarding the Provider – including vehicle information, and the ability to contact the Provider by telephone.
                                Once you select a Provider, please note the following:

PAYMENT AUTHORIZATION:
                                ROAD MARSHALL will place an immediate payment authorization to your credit card account in the estimated amount of the service (or in the case of roadside assistance, the amount quoted in the ROAD MARSHALL mobile application). However, the ultimate charge to your credit card account will be for the actual cost of the service.
CANCELLATION

You may cancel your order prior to the Provider dispatching a truck to your location at no cost to you.
If less than 15 minutes has elapsed after the Provider dispatched a truck, cancellation is subject to payment of a $20 non-refundable charge.
If more than 15 minutes has elapsed after the Provider dispatched the truck, you are responsible for paying the full amount quoted in the ROAD MARSHALL mobile application.
ADDITIONAL CHARGES:
                                To the extent your description of the services needed and/or conditions impacting your vehicle are deficient, inaccurate or otherwise misstated and/or the services required are more extensive than your description indicated, the price quote provided through the ROAD MARSHALL mobile application shall not be binding and you are responsible for paying for any additional services needed and/or requested.

For the avoidance of doubt: ROAD MARSHALL itself does not provide any roadside assistance or tow services, and ROAD MARSHALL is not a services carrier. Any roadside assistance and/or tow services are through the Provider. ROAD MARSHALL solely provides the platform through which you and the Provider can learn about each other. The provision of the services by the Provider to you is therefore subject to any agreement that you choose to enter into with the Provider. ROAD MARSHALL is never a party to any such agreement and you hereby agree to release ROAD MARSHALL from all liability and claims arising from any acts or omissions of Provider.

If you believe that ROAD MARSHALL has not adhered to the User Terms or you have any dispute with ROAD MARSHALL, please contact ROAD MARSHALL using the contact information provided below. We will do our best to address your concerns and each party agrees to attempt to resolve any disputes with the other amicably.
Except as provided herein, you and ROAD MARSHALL agree that we will resolve any disputes between us that we cannot resolve as provided above through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. All such controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and ROAD MARSHALL relating to the ROAD MARSHALL Services or these User Terms (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an available alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs, documents, or other evidence submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA (or ADR Provider, if applicable), you and ROAD MARSHALL must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA (or ADR Provider, if applicable) rules, and the hearing (if any) will be held in a location reasonably convenient to both parties unless the parties agree otherwise on a specific location.
If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, ROAD MARSHALL will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and ROAD MARSHALL also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and ROAD MARSHALL retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these User Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these User Terms.
Neither you nor ROAD MARSHALL may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or ROAD MARSHALL's individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
If any provision of this Section 21 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section 21 shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section 21 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this User Terms. This Section 21 will survive the termination of this User Terms or your relationship with ROAD MARSHALL.
HIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES OR THE RULES OF AN ADR PROVIDER.
22. Contact Us.
