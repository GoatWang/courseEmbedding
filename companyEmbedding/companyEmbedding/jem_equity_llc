Now companies can measure the real impact of their mobile marketing strategy. - Ed McLaughlin, Managing Partner, JEM Equity Advisors & Chief Marketing Officer, Mobixy


Past News ReleasesRSS



Jersey City, NJ (PRWEB)
August 8, 2010
 JEM Equity Advisors, the marketing and strategy firm dedicated to start-up and early stage companies, announced today it has partnered with mobile analytics provider Mobixy, LLC.
Under the arrangement, Ed McLaughlin, Managing Partner, JEM Equity Advisors, will serve as the Chief Marketing Officer of Mobixy. 
“More and more companies have turned to the mobile device as a way to interact with customers and build brands. Yet traditional, device-based applications have limitations – one of which is the ability to understand application performance and usage. Mobixy solves this problem by moving the storage and processing of data from the mobile device to our powerful, centralized platform. Now companies can measure the real impact of their mobile marketing strategy,” said McLaughlin.   
Mobixy launched its beta product on July 15, 2010. During the beta period, marketers and developers will have an opportunity to experience a “portion” of the platform, which will help the firm test and perfect the service.
In exchange, Mobixy is offering all beta users a 25% discount on the first year of service. In addition, a limited number of developers who participate will receive free marketing resources, including a custom-designed co-branded brochure (in PDF format).  
To learn more about the beta launch, visit the Mobixy website at http://www.mobixy.com.
About JEM Equity Advisors
Ed McLaughlin founded JEM Equity Advisors to provide marketing and strategy services to start-up firms, early stage companies, and growth-oriented small businesses. While a majority of work is completed on a project or retainer basis, in some instances JEM will accept a permanent role with the client in exchange for equity. 
In addition to consulting and entrepreneurial work, McLaughlin writes The Baby Gorillas (a business blog about thinking big and acting small) and The MetroUpd8 Project (a source of ideas and perspective about winning in business).

Announcement

JEM Raw Chocolate, LLC (JEM Raw) of Bend, Oregon announced a voluntary recall of its full line of all nut butter spreads within expiry because it has the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. Health authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA), Center for Disease Control (CDC) have linked the illnesses to person(s) who have consumed nut spreads, including JEM Raw products. There have been eleven (11) illnesses reported but no deaths or hospitalizations to date. In light of this investigation, and with an abundance of caution, JEM Raw has initiated a voluntary recall of all products and sizes, packaged in glass jars, and sold under brand name JEM Raw Organics. The following products are recalled:    Product Name Net Weight (oz.) UPC     Cashew Cardamom - Sprouted Cashew Almond Spread 1 6 09728 97861 7   Cinnamon Red Maca - Sprouted Almond Spread 1 6 09728 97862 4   Hazelnut Raw Cacao - Sprouted Hazelnut Spread 1 6 09728 97865 5   Superberry Maqui Camu - Sprouted Almond Spread 1 6 09728 97864 8   Cashew Cardamom - Sprouted Cashew Almond Spread 6 6 09728 97860 0   Cinnamon Red Maca - Sprouted Almond Spread 6 6 09728 97848 8   Hazelnut Raw Cacao -Sprouted Hazelnut Spread 6 6 09728 97857 0   Superberry Maqui Camu - Sprouted Almond Spread 6 6 09728 97858 7   Cashew Cardamom - Sprouted Cashew Almond Spread 16 6 09728 97854 9   Cinnamon Red Maca - Sprouted Almond Spread 16 6 09728 97850 1   Hazelnut Raw Cacao - Sprouted Hazelnut Spread 16 6 09728 97851 8   Superberry Maqui Camu - Sprouted Almond Spread 16 6 09728 97852 5      The JEM Raw recalled products were distributed nationwide in retail stores and through mail order. Products are distributed between June 2015 and November 2015. JEM Raw is working with distributors and retailers to remove these products from retail shelves. Consumers do not need to return the product to the store where it was purchased. Instead, consumers should discard any product and its container. JEM Raw will work directly with each consumer to manage replacement of its product. Additional details can be found at www.jemraw.com. Those with questions may contact JEM Raw Chocolate, LLC at (541) 728-3844 between 9am 4pm PST, Monday through Friday. Jen Moore, co-founder and CEO, said, “We are taking these steps because consumer safety is our top priority. As a health food company, our customer’s health is our number one priority. Although no JEM Raw products have tested positive for Salmonella, we feel strongly that issuing a voluntary recall is the right thing to do. JEM is working closely with the FDA, ODA, and OHA to determine the root cause of the outbreak.”
