Live at Ronnie Scott’s Preorder
Posted on Juil 11 by blondsummer
    PRE ORDER EUROPE   PRE ORDER US   JOHN MCLAUGHLIN – TRAILBLAZING GUITARIST, COMPOSER, AND BANDLEADER – TO RELEASE LIVE @ RONNIE SCOTT’S ON SEPTEMBER 15 on ABSTRACT LOGIX MUSIC Searing set finds McLaughlin’s 4th Dimension exploring material from  throughout his storied career. “Ronnie Scott’s…” mused the boundary-shattering guitarist John McLaughlin, “…where would I be without them?” The venerable London jazz club and its charismatic namesake gave so much to McLaughlin’s career, the roots of which extend as far back as McLaughlin’s stint as a member of the club’s house band in the 1960s. Since then, his pioneering spirit, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisational fearlessness have taken him around the world, put him on stage alongside fellow giants such as Miles Davis and Tony Williams, and has given listeners a series of compelling, revolutionary recordings that have redefined improvised music for generations to come. On September 15, Abstract Logix issues Live @ Ronnie Scott’s – a souvenir of a sold-out, two-night stand at the beloved venue by John McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension, recorded in March of 2017....

The Mahavishnu Orchestra Gig List by Walter Kolosky
Posted on Juin 15 by blondsummer
This Mahavishnu Orchestra Gig List is the product of hundreds of hours of laborious research and the hunting down of obtuse clues. The ultimate goal is to verify every single show the original Mahavishnu Orchestra ever presented. In the course of this endeavor an important historical document will be created. The imagery of the poster artwork and ads, the humorous misspellings, the growth from opener to headliner and the universe of diverse musicians sharing the bills paint a vivid picture of the ascending orbit of this truly remarkable band. The gig list also shows just how much this band worked! It was too much, really. How could you not be totally exhausted, physically and mentally, playing this demanding music day after day, night after night in city after city? It amazes me the band was able to keep it together for as long as it did. Every meteor eventually crashes. The rise of The Mahavishnu Orchestra took place during a period of great artistic freedom and expression in the United States. Yet, the times were also enveloped in social,...

JOHN McLAUGHLIN (born 4 January 1942 in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England), also known as Mahavishnu John McLaughlin, is an English jazz and jazz fusion guitarist and composer. He played with Tony Williams' group Lifetime and then with Miles Davis on his landmark electric jazz-fusion albums In A Silent Way, Bitches Brew, and Jack Johnson. His 1970s electric band, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, performed a technically virtuosic and complex style of music that fused eclectic jazz and rock with eastern and Indian influences. 
McLaughlin has been cited as a major influence on many generations from the '70s and '80s fusion guitarists, prominent players such as Steve Morse, Eric Johnson, Mike Stern, Al Di Meola, Pebber Brown and Scott Henderson. His influence did not stop in the 80's, as hardcore punk guitarist Greg Ginn of Black Flag cited Birds of Fire by The Mahavishnu Orchestra which inspired him to record more progressive guitar work and even record instrumental songs. According to Pat Metheny, McLaughlin has changed the evolution of the guitar during several of his periods of playing. In an interview with Downbeat, Chick Corea remarked that "...what John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair stand on end". In 2010, Jeff Beck called him "the best guitarist alive".

He was 89.    John McLaughlin, host of the syndicated public affairs program “The McLaughlin Group.” ‘The McLaughlin Group’  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.            By Erik Wemple  By Erik Wemple   August 16, 2016  Follow @ErikWemple     John McLaughlin, a former Jesuit priest, speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon and conservative provocateur whose pugnacious style as a host of a political chat show helped usher in the era of impolite punditry, died Aug. 16 at his home in Washington. He was 89.  The cause was complications from prostate cancer, said journalist Eleanor Clift, one of his on-air sparring partners. Mr. McLaughlin missed the most recent installment of his syndicated public affairs program, “The McLaughlin Group.” For more than three decades, Mr. McLaughlin sat in judgment of national political trends on “The McLaughlin Group” and goaded journalists and pundits into moving beyond fact into the argumentative terrain of ideological talking points and rhetorical hyperbole. He corralled guests into critiquing political decisions and probabilities on a sliding scale of 1 to 10 — with 10 representing “metaphysical certitude.” At times, “The McLaughlin Group” felt more like a cross-talk show than a talk show, with the host interrupting his guests’ trains of thought or bellowing “Wronnng!” to express disapproval of their statements. His approach forever changed audience expectations of public affairs programming. Mr. McLaughlin’s impact can be glimpsed almost any night on cable news channels, for better or worse. And although no one ever mistook Mr. McLaughlin for a digital visionary, his show’s staccato approach to wringing opinions from guests previewed the Internet’s addiction to fast and unprocessed news bites.   The Rev. John J. McLaughlin in 1970 formally became a candidate for Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate from Rhode Island. (UPI Telephoto)  “Look at ‘The McLaughlin Group’ now and it looks positively quaint,” said Syracuse University television historian Robert Thompson. “The kind of thing McLaughlin was doing is being done in so many places.” Although “The McLaughlin Group” dominated his later life, Mr. McLaughlin had a three-act career that started in the priesthood. He worked his way into politics, running unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate seat in 1970 and later landing a job in the Nixon White House. As a speechwriter for the president and one of his fiercest defenders through the Watergate scandal, Mr. McLaughlin attracted media attention upon which he capitalized to get into television. When “The McLaughlin Group” launched in 1982 on WRC (Channel 4) in Washington, D.C., political chat shows were unrecognizable by modern standards. “Washington Week in Review,” produced by the public television outlet WETA, was a cerebral and quiet product. “Agronsky and Company,” on WUSA (Channel 9), occasionally veered into shouting and political showmanship but not with a great degree of reliability. Mr. McLaughlin saw an opening in the market for TV blather. “Energy, tempo and bonhomie,” he said, were a few of the vital ingredients he sought to infuse in the program, along with “first-rate reporting and straight opinion.” The program’s format, like its inspiration, remained steady over the show’s run, with Mr. McLaughlin sitting alone in the middle of the set and liberal and conservative commentators tethered in his orbit. Those guests regularly fielded not so much questions from Mr. McLaughlin as demands. In a September 1998 show during the debate over President Bill Clinton’s pending impeachment inquiry resulting from an affair with a White House intern, the host posed this typical “McLaughlin Group” formulation to his interlocutors: “On a survival probability scale of zero to 10 — zero, Mr. Clinton leaves office, he’s out, almost overnight; 10, Clinton stays, he finishes his term till January 2001 — rate the survival probability level of Bill Clinton as president,” he said.         1 of 66       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                                         Skip Ad   ×           Notable deaths of 2016      View Photos   Remembering those who have died this year.

Debbie Reynolds Actress Debbie Reynolds starred in the 1952 classic movie “Singin’ in the Rain” with Gene Kelly, shown above. Reynolds died one day after the death of her daughter, actress-writer Carrie Fisher. Reynolds was 84. “She’s now with Carrie and we’re all heartbroken,” her son Todd Fisher said. Read the Debbie Reynolds obituary  AFP/Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.           The gimmickry worked. Mr. McLaughlin’s best-known guests — then-Newsweek writer Clift, the late Baltimore Sun columnist Jack Germond, conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, and Washington-based journalist and editor Morton Kondracke — thrived in this corral. They often shouted over each other to present their opinions. “Next to ‘McLaughlin,’ all the rest of the shows are ‘Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,’ ” Clift once said. While Mr. McLaughlin was seated at the center of his show’s set, his politics favored the right. He once described himself as a “crypto-Republican” and gave the show something that TV Guide critic John Weisman in 1985 deemed noteworthy — “ ‘The McLaughlin Group’ is the only political show seen nationwide that favors the political right,” he said. On the strength of its host’s bouncing jowls and nonstop barking, the show roared in its early years and into the 1990s: In 1992, for instance, it was broadcast on 297 PBS stations, not to mention three NBC stations, for a total viewership of 3.5 million. It was the highest-rated public affairs show in the country’s top 10 markets, according to an account from the New York Times. Mr. McLaughlin cherished his celebrity. He told a Times interviewer in 1992, “Walking down 57th Street in New York, a car goes by and an 18-year-old kid opens the window and shouts, ‘Wronnng!’ ” From that cultural perch, “The McLaughlin Group” lost relevance in more recent years, in part because of the emergence of the Fox News Channel — which launched in 1996 — and because of the host’s advancing age. As an octogenarian, Mr. McLaughlin was not quite the on-air force that his younger incarnation had proved to be. The show’s later episodes received attention on the Internet primarily when one of its guests made a rude or offensive remark. In July 2012, for instance, Buchanan won a shot of publicity for “The McLaughlin Group” when he expressed hope that the United States would not see its first female president until 2040 or 2050. Seeing a chance to provoke, Mr. McLaughlin argued that Hillary Clinton, then serving as secretary of state in the Obama administration, “owed it to her gender” to run for the office in the 2016 election. Mr. McLaughlin’s bombastic style was memorably parodied by comedian Dana Carvey on “Saturday Night Live.” And some of Mr. McLaughlin’s colleagues contended that the tyrannical fellow whom viewers saw on “The McLaughlin Group” was no act. A female office manager who worked for the host filed a sexual harassment suit against him that was settled out of court in 1989. Kara Swisher, a McLaughlin staffer who later rose to prominence at the Wall Street Journal, was once ordered by Mr. McLaughlin to make toast. After she balked at the command, he told her, “If I ask you to make toast and you don’t do it, I can fire you.” A critical look at the “The McLaughlin Group” by commentator Eric Alterman in 1990 decried its “abhorrence of complexity, its reductiveness, its celebration of nastiness and macho posturing.” Alterman wrote that it is hard to determine “when John McLaughlin is serious and when he is making fun of himself being serious.”   The priesthood John Joseph McLaughlin was born in Providence, R.I., on March 29, 1927. He described his parents, of Irish descent, as “rootedly Democratic.” His father was a furniture salesman. The young McLaughlin attended LaSalle Academy, a Christian Brothers school in Providence. It was in those formative years that he built his reverence for the Jesuit religious order, telling the New York Times that it had “a gallantry, an intellectual adventurism, a style, a panache.” He began his training for the priesthood at Weston College in Massachusetts. He later received a bachelor’s degree from Boston College, where he also earned master’s degrees in philosophy and education.  In the 1950s, Mr. McLaughlin was posted to teaching positions at high schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut. He then secured a transfer to New York City and, while pursuing a doctorate in communications at Columbia University, began working for America, the Manhattan-based Jesuit publication, where he became assistant editor. Mr. McLaughlin added another platform to his brand, hitting the lecture circuit on topics that often circled back to sex and marriage. In 1968, he met his future wife, Ann Lauenstein Dore, when he was delivering a speech at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was the school’s director of alumni relations. Over the years, Mr. McLaughlin feuded with the top editor of America, the Rev. Donald R. Campion, and left the journal in 1970. It was unclear what prompted the separation, but Campion issued a lukewarm assessment of his colleague, noting that he was fond of “baroque” words: “You don’t know quite what they mean, but they sort of stun you.” The departure from the journal helped clear the way for Mr. McLaughlin’s brief but high-profile career in U.S. politics. He broke with his family heritage by registering as a Republican in advance of his candidacy in the 1970 U.S. Senate race in Rhode Island. Mr. McLaughlin took aim at incumbent John O. Pastore (D) by running as a “peace” candidate during the Vietnam War. Pastore, said Mr. McLaughlin, stuck to “pro-Pentagon” policies that were prolonging the war and costing taxpayers their hard-earned cash. Vietnam, charged the challenger, was “an incredibly bloated expenditure.” For his part, Pastore said at the time that “McLaughlin’s driving me batty. How can I debate with a man my religion teaches me to call Father?” Secular success Pastore held his office with 67.5 percent of the vote. Mr. McLaughlin parlayed his loss at the polls into a professional win — an appointment as a junior speechwriter in the Nixon White House, which was already familiar with Mr. McLaughlin’s written work. An essay Mr. McLaughlin had written for America in December 1969 titled “Public Regulation and the News Media” sympathized with the well-known views of Vice President Spiro Agnew on the alleged biases of the mainstream media. In his piece, Mr. McLaughlin railed against the leanings of the country’s “broadcasting hierarchy.” Buchanan, then a White House speechwriter, approved. Mr. McLaughlin became special assistant to the president. He toured Southeast Asia and reported back unremittingly positive news of combat operations. He said U.S. bombing runs were “scrupulously and assiduously” pinpointed in their precision, resulting in minimal civilian casualties and ecological damage. In 1972, operatives of Nixon’s reelection campaign orchestrated the break-in and bugging of the Democratic Party’s national headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. During the scandal’s fallout, Mr. McLaughlin remained one of the president’s most vocal defenders. Shortly before Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, the aide reportedly told a gathering of Republicans that the president would be regarded by historians as “the greatest moral leader of the last third of this century.” Mr. McLaughlin served in the White House for two months under President Gerald R. Ford before leaving to start a public affairs and media relations consulting firm with Dore, whom he married in August 1975 after successfully petitioning Pope Paul VI for laicization, relieving him of priestly obligations. Dore had been campaign manager for Mr. McLaughlin’s Senate run, communications director for the Committee to Reelect the President and a government relations executive with Union Carbide. She was secretary of labor toward the end of President Ronald Reagan’s administration. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1992. His second marriage, to Cristina Vidal, also ended in divorce. He had no immediate survivors. In 1980, Mr. McLaughlin worked his way into radio on WRC-AM but was fired a year into the gig, “reportedly for talking too much and taking too few calls,” according to a published account. Then he rounded up funding from a Nixon administration veteran and launched “The McLaughlin Group.” Though the “group” and the show’s format helped to propel it into pop-culture history, the “McLaughlin” component was indispensable. “ ‘The McLaughlin Group’ presented something that wasn’t just about public affairs and civic information,” said Thompson, the Syracuse University scholar. “It was show biz, and the show biz came from McLaughlin himself.”  Read more  Washington Post obituaries                   politics   Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false          Please provide a valid email address.

 Also available John McLaughlin & John Surman — Where Fortune Smiles (Japanese paper sleeve edition) ... CD 34.99 

                    A groundbreaking early album from guitarist John McLaughlin – a set that's a bit different than his more famous work of the mid 70s – with maybe a more avant approach, and a lot more bite as well!  The set's really an equal collaboration, rather than just a McLaughlin session – although it's become known as such, since the guitarist is the most famous musician – amongst a fantastic lineup that includes John Surman on reeds, Karl Berger on vibes, Dave Holland on bass, and Stu Martin on drums – all working in a freewheeling mode that's a lot like some of Surman's Trio records on the Dawn label from the same time!  Surman is especially great here – adding in soulful currents at some spots, freer lines at others – and it's great to hear the tones of McLaughlin's guitar balanced against Berger's vibes.  Titles include "Glancing Backwards", "Earth Bound Hearts", and "Where Fortune Smiles". (Out of print.)  © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 




Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.




Used CD Grade

    We have only one grade for non-new CDs at Dusty Groove — "Used CD".
    This grade is somewhat all-encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer
    Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play
    without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove,
    you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not,
    then you may return it for a full refund.


    With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of
    surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all.  You can also expect the case to be
    clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we
    handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted
    otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so
    look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.

John McLaughlin, TV Host Who Made Combat of Punditry, Dies at 89

John McLaughlin began his television show, “The McLaughlin Group,” in 1982.



John McLaughlin, a former Roman Catholic priest who became an aide to Richard M. Nixon in the White House and parlayed his fierce defense of the president into a television career as host of “The McLaughlin Group,” the long-running Sunday morning program of combative political punditry, died on Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 89.His death was announced on the program’s Facebook page. The columnist Eleanor Clift, a longtime panelist on the show, wrote in The Daily Beast that he had been treated for prostate cancer for some time and that it had spread.Mr. McLaughlin had been absent from the show this last weekend for the first time in more than 34 years. “I am under the weather,” he wrote to viewers in a note that began the broadcast, adding that his voice was “weaker than usual” but that his “spirit is strong.”As creator, executive producer and host of “The McLaughlin Group,” which began in 1982, Mr. McLaughlin helped reinvent the political talk-show format by injecting unabashed partisanship and a dash of entertainment.

His program, broadcast on select CBS and PBS stations, inspired a generation of pundits, although few quite adopted his self-exaggerated, blustery persona. His penchant for giving nicknames to his panelists, his riffling through the week’s topics and his prosecutorial questioning became fodder for comedians, notably Dana Carvey on “Saturday Night Live,” even while policy makers tuned in for the political observations.

The show always ended with a prediction by each of the panelists, with Mr. McLaughlin getting the final word, even if seemingly with tongue in cheek. In 1989, for example, he predicted, “Within weeks, Delaware will authorize public flogging for drug trafficking.’’ (It did not.) His trademark signoff was a robust “Bye-bye!”Mr. McLaughlin, who left the priesthood in 1975, “proved that you could be provocative and an advocate and entertaining, and bring a larger audience to public affairs programming,” said Tammy Haddad, a former vice president of political coverage for MSNBC. Ms. Haddad was also an executive producer of “Hardball With Chris Matthews,” whose host got ample exposure on Mr. McLaughlin’s weekly round table earlier in his career.

“The early success of CNN,” Ms. Haddad noted, was based on its “political food fights” by the likes of Robert Novak and Patrick J. Buchanan, both of whom were founding “McLaughlin Group” panelists.While in the White House, Mr. McLaughlin, well-informed but prone to tirades, would “sometimes almost become a cartoon of himself” when reporters called, said Bob Schieffer, the CBS News Washington reporter who became host of the CBS Sunday show “Face the Nation.” But as a talk-show host, Mr. Schieffer said, Mr. McLaughlin changed the industry with his shouting.Combativeness was part of Mr. McLaughlin’s style from the beginning. As a Jesuit priest, he had been in frequent conflict with his superiors, who disapproved of his 1970 run for the United States Senate in Rhode Island as a Republican calling for a rapid end to the Vietnam War. Father McLaughlin, who had resigned as an editor at the Jesuit magazine America and switched his party affiliation, was believed to be the first active Roman Catholic priest to run for the Senate.He stood in sharp contrast to his fellow Jesuit Robert Drinan of Massachusetts, who was given permission to run for the House that same year as an antiwar Democrat. Father McLaughlin, who was chastised by the bishop of Providence, R.I., for his Senate run, lost by a wide margin to the incumbent Democrat, John O. Pastore.Father McLaughlin went to Washington anyway, joining President Nixon’s speechwriting team in 1971. Nicknamed Nixon’s Priest, he gave frequent speeches in defense of the president’s conduct of the Vietnam War, including bombing missions into Cambodia.

As the Watergate crisis deepened, Father McLaughlin became one of the president’s most visible supporters. At one news conference, he dismissed Nixon’s use of profanity as “emotional drainage.” Less than two weeks before the president resigned, Father McLaughlin warned in a speech at the National Press Club that the nation would face a “parade of horrors” should Nixon be impeached. (On July 31, 1973, Father Drinan became the first congressman to call for impeachment in a House resolution.)After Vice President Gerald R. Ford succeeded Nixon in August 1974, Father McLaughlin’s speechwriting position was abolished.Father McLaughlin had maintained a high profile in Washington, living at the tony Watergate complex rather than in the austere Jesuit residence at Georgetown University where Father Drinan lived. This led his church superiors to rebuke him in May 1974, summoning him to a period of “reflection.”

Instead, in 1975, Mr. McLaughlin successfully petitioned Pope Paul VI and was released from his vows.

That same year he married Ann Dore, his former Senate campaign manager. She later served as secretary of labor under President Ronald Reagan. The couple divorced in 1992. In 1997 he married Cristina Vidal, the vice president for operations of Oliver Productions, the company that produces “The McLaughlin Report.” That marriage also ended in divorce. There was no immediate word on survivors.John Joseph McLaughlin was born in Providence on March 29, 1927, to the former Eva Turcotte and Augustus H. McLaughlin, a regional salesman for a furniture company. After graduating from LaSalle Academy in Providence and studying for the priesthood in Massachusetts, he was ordained a priest in 1959.

He earned master’s degrees in philosophy and English literature from Boston College, and a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. He then taught at the Jesuit-run Fairfield College Preparatory School in Connecticut.After leaving the White House, he and his wife at the time, Ms. Dore, founded a media relations and public affairs consulting company. In the early 1980s, Mr. McLaughlin hosted a weekend talk program on the Washington radio station WRC. After joining the magazine National Review as the Washington editor and a columnist, he founded a television production concern with the backing of former Nixon allies and persuaded NBC’s Washington television affiliate, WRC-TV, to broadcast a new type of weekend political talk show and to let him host it.At the time, TV round tables of journalists like “Agronsky & Company” and “Washington Week in Review” dissected the week’s developments in a sober, nonpartisan style. Mr. McLaughlin envisioned a more animated, argumentative format including a panel reflecting conservative, moderate and liberal views, with him as moderator.From its debut in 1982 “The McLaughlin Group” took on the flavor of a barroom debate, pitting a largely white, male cadre of columnists and political insiders against one another as they gave vent to views from the hard right (Mr. Novak and Mr. Buchanan) to the center-left (Morton Kondracke of The New Republic and Jack Germond of The Baltimore Sun). Ms. Clift, a Newsweek correspondent at the time, and the Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page, who is black, later joined the group as more liberal regulars.Regardless of the panelists’ political persuasions, Mr. McLaughlin, whose own politics leaned decidedly right, would often fire off questions and cut them off, shouting “Wronnnng!”When the cameras were off, the panelists often feuded. Mr. Novak left after a falling out in 1988 and founded a similar program on CNN, “Capital Gang.” In an interview on PBS in June 2007, Mr. Novak said of Mr. McLaughlin, “He may not be pure evil, but he’s close to it.” Mr. Germond, another of the original panelists, called the show “really bad TV,” and said he had stayed on only because he needed the money to pay his daughter’s medical school tuition.

Mr. McLaughlin was also the executive producer and host of “John McLaughlin’s One on One,” a weekly interview program that was broadcast on NBC and PBS stations. From 1989 to 1994 he hosted a daily interview show on CNBC.

In a 1992 profile in The Times, Mr. McLaughlin defended his style. “Does this depreciate journalism?” he asked. “Not one damned bit. Journalists can get very pompous, especially in the formalized days of ‘Meet the Press,’ when they took themselves so damned seriously. This show demythologizes the press, and I think people like that.”

 Correction: August 18, 2016  
An obituary on Wednesday about John McLaughlin, the host of the long-running television talk show “The McLaughlin Group,” referred incorrectly to the magazine National Review, where he worked in the 1980s. It is published biweekly, not weekly. The obituary also misstated the length of Mr. McLaughlin’s tenure there. He remained at National Review for a number of years after “The McLaughlin Group” made its debut in 1982; he did not begin the program “after a stint” at the magazine. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the year Mr. McLaughlin was ordained a priest. It was 1959, not 1947.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
