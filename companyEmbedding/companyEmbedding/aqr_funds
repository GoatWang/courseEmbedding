Product Specialist- Global Stock Selection

Product Management –Global Stock Selection
 
Product Specialist 

 

About AQR Capital Management 
 
AQR is a global investment management firm built at the intersection of financial theory and practical application. We strive to deliver superior, long-term results for our clients by seeking to filter out market noise to identify and isolate what matters most, and by developing ideas that stand up to rigorous testing. Underpinning this philosophy is an unrelenting commitment to excellence in technology — powering our insights and analysis. This unique combination has made us leaders in alternative and traditional strategies since 1998.
 
AQR takes a systematic, research-driven approach, applying quantitative tools to process fundamental information and manage risk. Our clients include institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations and sovereign wealth funds, as well as financial advisors.
 
 
About The Team 
 
The Global Stock Selection (GSS) group is responsible for the portfolio management and research of AQR's strategies related to individual equities and equity-related securities across all global liquid markets. GSS models are applied to market-neutral long/short portfolios in AQR hedge funds as well as to long-only, relaxed-constraint and low volatility portfolios for institutional equity mandates and mutual funds.
 
Product management teams play a key role in AQR’s portfolio management, product development, and enhancement and are involved in many stages of the investment process including new business presentations, new account onboarding, portfolio implementation, performance monitoring and analysis, and portfolio review meetings with clients. The teams interact closely with the rest of the firm including research, portfolio management, trading, business development, legal, compliance, risk and marketing. Through this collaboration, product management teams have in-depth knowledge of the strategies they cover and are expected to be in-house experts of their respective products. They are an integral part of initiatives to create, manage, and sell AQR products.
Your Role

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.

AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty.

Alternative Thinking 1Q 2017: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes


Topic:
Asset Allocation, Portfolio Management



This issue of Capital Market Assumptions updates our multi-year expected returns for major asset classes. Compared to historical averages, we are still very much in a world of low expected returns.
In this year’s edition, we modify our equity expected return methodologies to account for the growing corporate substitution of share buybacks for dividends. The topic is explored in greater depth in an Appendix which discusses specific details and presents the underlying theory and practical guidance on the data required to build these estimates.

Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch are some of the most well-known investors of our time, but there has been little empirical analysis to explain their performance. In this webinar, Jordan Brooks and Dan Villalon examine the track records of these “superstars” from a factor perspective to see if their investment philosophies — applied systematically — can help demystify their long-term alpha.

Alternative Thinking 4Q 2016: Superstar Investors


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Many famous investors are outspoken about their investment philosophies, and carefully apply them to a select number of securities. In this Alternative Thinking, we seek to apply their wisdom systematically; to ask whether their philosophies applied broadly might still generate “alpha”.
Our analysis suggests there are many ways to achieve long-run investment success. The takeaway for investors is to identify structural edges and commit to seeing them through inevitable periods of underperformance. As each of our superstars shows, “merely good” edges over time may compound to great long-term performance.

Insights in Action Webinar: What's Value Got to Do With It?


Topic:
Insights in Action, Webinar, Value Timing, Style Portfolio



Can Value Timing Improve a Style Portfolio?

Just like asset classes, styles - or factors - can become cheaper or more expensive than average. In this webinar, Cliff Asness and Ronen Israel discuss whether this information can be used to build a better style portfolio, and compare value timing to strategic diversification for style investors. They also take a look at the style landscape today, evaluating the extent to which concerns of expensiveness and crowding actually show up in prices.

Publication Date: September 23, 2010

 AQR is a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Connecticut, that is considering offering a wholly new line of product to retail investors, namely the ability to invest in the price phenomenon known as momentum. There is a large body of empirical evidence supporting momentum across many different asset classes and countries. However, up until this point, momentum was a strategy employed nearly exclusively by hedge funds, and thus not an available investment strategy to most individual investors. This case highlights the difficulties in implementing this "mutual fund-itizing" of a hedge fund product, along with the challenges that the open-end and regulatory features that a mutual fund poses to many successful strategies implemented in other contexts. In addition, it gives students the ability to calculate and interpret various horizons of correlations between many popular investment strategies using long time-series data and then thinking about the potential complementarities of strategies from a portfolio construction context.

Wholesale DELTA Fund



Fact Sheet












Overview








Investment Objective
                                Many hedge funds pursue similar, often well-known and widely understood strategies that seek to generate investment returns. AQR has found that a significant portion of hedge fund returns can be explained as compensation for assuming certain common hedge fund risk exposures, what we call “hedge fund risk premia.” While these largely uncorrelated return streams can be attractive for most portfolios, they require a significant amount of skill to capture, are difficult to isolate, and are often provided by managers at high fees. The AQR Wholesale DELTA Fund (“the Fund”) seeks to provide cost-effective exposure to a portfolio containing a diversified group of hedge fund risk premia. Over the medium to long term, the Fund will seek to achieve a return in excess of the benchmark (i.e., the Bloomberg AusBond Bank Bill Index, measured in AUD) by capturing the systematic components of dynamic trading strategies traditionally pursued by hedge funds.

Daniel Baird Bergstresser, Lauren H. Cohen, Randolph B. Cohen and Christopher J. Malloy
AQR is a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Connecticut, that is considering offering a wholly new line of product to retail investors, namely the ability to invest in the price phenomenon known as momentum. There is a large body of empirical evidence supporting momentum across many different asset classes and countries. However, up until this point, momentum was a strategy employed nearly exclusively by hedge funds, and thus not an available investment strategy to most individual investors. This case highlights the difficulties in implementing this "mutual fund-itizing" of a hedge fund product, along with the challenges that the open-end and regulatory features that a mutual fund poses to many successful strategies implemented in other contexts. In addition, it gives students the ability to calculate and interpret various horizons of correlations between many popular investment strategies using long time-series data and then thinking about the potential complementarities of strategies from a portfolio construction context.

AQR's Momentum Funds (B)
Daniel Baird Bergstresser, Lauren H. Cohen, Randolph B. Cohen and Christopher J. Malloy
This is a (B) case for AQR's Momentum Funds. It follows the first year of performance of the funds after launching, and gives students a critical inflection point for analyzing the nascent stages of a new product launch and the potential path dependence of the product depending on initial returns. It allows students to wrestle with the way forward given these conditions, and how (if at all) it changes their views, pitch, and perspective on the strategy, and traditional long-short strategies more generally.

Miracle Life, Inc.
Lauren Cohen, Christopher Malloy, Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy
Miracle Life is a firm with a unique setup and organizational structure. Specifically, it is a network marketing firm, also known as multi-level marketing (MLM) firm, which utilizes a large distributor base and depends on this individual distributor base to sell its products, giving explicit incentives for these individual distributors to both sell its products and sign up other distributors. The case gives students the opportunity to take the basic framework of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis and apply it to two unique perspectives of an identical problem. The students will then use this DCF approach to rationalize observed stock prices, connecting the two, and further reconcile how a company's future plan for growth, and the plausibility of this plan, has implications jointly for DCF and stock prices.

Investment philosophy and strategies[edit]
AQR employs a research-based “systematic and consistent approach” to portfolio construction.[2] This disciplined approach of identifying long-term, repeatable sources of return means “having a high conviction in the process, but not a high conviction in any particular stock.”[2] The firm is a strong proponent of diversification within portfolios, as well as adding strategies with low correlation to traditional asset classes as a complement to existing portfolios.[3] AQR is a leader in investor and advisor education, often sharing insight into its strategies through research, white papers and events.
AQR was an early adopter of style, or factor, investing given the strategy’s academic roots. Although the four styles — value, momentum, defensive and carry — have been well-known and used in quantitative investing for decades, they’ve gained popularity in recent years under the mantle of “Smart Beta.” AQR has long advocated for using these styles together, citing their diversifying qualities. AQR reiterated its strong belief in the strategy, but objection to the name “Smart Beta” in the 2014 article, “Smart Beta: Not New, Not Beta, Still Awesome.”[4]
AQR is perhaps best known for its alternative investment strategies, which aim to offer low correlation to traditional, equity-dominated portfolios. AQR was one of the first investment managers to offer a risk parity strategy, which aims to balance allocations based on underlying risk rather than asset classes. The firm also offers managed futures, a trend-following strategy that is “uncorrelated with other asset classes” and supported by over a century of academic evidence.[2]
AQR was one of the first managers to offer alternative mutual funds, launching its family of mutual funds in 2009.[5] The firm’s liquid alternative strategies were a “category leader” in Morningstar’s ranking for 2015.[6]
History[edit]
Three of AQR’s founding principals — Cliff Asness, Robert Krail and John Liew — met in the University of Chicago’s PhD program, where the foundation of the firm’s investment philosophy took shape.[7]
While still working on his dissertation, which focused on momentum and value, Asness joined Goldman Sachs, where he was asked to lead a new quantitative research team within the firm’s asset management division.[8] Liew and Krail joined him, and the new team applied what they learned in academia to manage both hedge-fund and long-only assets.[7]
In 1998, Asness, David Kabiller, Krail and Liew left Goldman Sachs to establish AQR.[8]
AQR was among the first hedge fund managers to voluntarily register at its inception with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm’s first product was a hedge fund, though it soon (2000) entered into traditional portfolio management. In 2009, AQR became one of the first investment managers to offer alternative mutual funds.[7]
As of July 30, 2017, the firm has $195 billion in assets under management.[1]
Ties to academia[edit]
As of 2016, approximately half of the AQR’s employees have earned advanced degrees, with 52 holding PhDs.[9] The firm is known to maintain strong, positive ties to leading universities and supports financial research through annual academic awards.
AQR’s Insight Award (see below for winners), which “recognizes the most significant and innovative academic research that offers practical applications for investors,” awarded its fifth annual slate of winners in 2016.[10]
In 2014, AQR partnered with the London Business School to establish The AQR Asset Management Institute, which focuses on asset management research and thought leadership. The Institute rewards scholars in the field with annual grants and prizes.[11]
The firm is also a sponsor of the AQR Top Finance Graduate Award at Copenhagen Business School, which honors the PhD graduates whose research carries the greatest potential impact.[12]
AQR Insight Award[edit]
AQR awards a $100,000 annual prize, the AQR Insight Award “to encourage and acknowledge academics whose research promises to be of significant use to institutional investors.”

2012 Winners: Bryan Kelly and Seth Pruitt[13]
2013 Winners: Martin Lettau, Michael Weber, and Matteo Maggiori[14]
2014 Winners: Eric Budish, Peter Cramton, and John J. Shim[15]
2015 Co-Winners: Robert Ready, Nikolai Roussanov and Colin Ward / Christopher L. Culp, Yoshio Nozawa and Pietro Veronesi[16]
2016 Co-Winners: Samuel M. Hartzmark and Kelly Shue / Darrell Duffie and Haoxiang Zhu

AQR employs a research-based “systematic and consistent approach” to portfolio construction.[2] This disciplined approach of identifying long-term, repeatable sources of return means “having a high conviction in the process, but not a high conviction in any particular stock.”[2] The firm is a strong proponent of diversification within portfolios, as well as adding strategies with low correlation to traditional asset classes as a complement to existing portfolios.[3] AQR is a leader in investor and advisor education, often sharing insight into its strategies through research, white papers and events.
AQR was an early adopter of style, or factor, investing given the strategy’s academic roots. Although the four styles — value, momentum, defensive and carry — have been well-known and used in quantitative investing for decades, they’ve gained popularity in recent years under the mantle of “Smart Beta.” AQR has long advocated for using these styles together, citing their diversifying qualities. AQR reiterated its strong belief in the strategy, but objection to the name “Smart Beta” in the 2014 article, “Smart Beta: Not New, Not Beta, Still Awesome.”[4]
AQR is perhaps best known for its alternative investment strategies, which aim to offer low correlation to traditional, equity-dominated portfolios. AQR was one of the first investment managers to offer a risk parity strategy, which aims to balance allocations based on underlying risk rather than asset classes. The firm also offers managed futures, a trend-following strategy that is “uncorrelated with other asset classes” and supported by over a century of academic evidence.[2]
AQR was one of the first managers to offer alternative mutual funds, launching its family of mutual funds in 2009.[5] The firm’s liquid alternative strategies were a “category leader” in Morningstar’s ranking for 2015.[6]
History[edit]
Three of AQR’s founding principals — Cliff Asness, Robert Krail and John Liew — met in the University of Chicago’s PhD program, where the foundation of the firm’s investment philosophy took shape.[7]
While still working on his dissertation, which focused on momentum and value, Asness joined Goldman Sachs, where he was asked to lead a new quantitative research team within the firm’s asset management division.[8] Liew and Krail joined him, and the new team applied what they learned in academia to manage both hedge-fund and long-only assets.[7]
In 1998, Asness, David Kabiller, Krail and Liew left Goldman Sachs to establish AQR.[8]
AQR was among the first hedge fund managers to voluntarily register at its inception with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm’s first product was a hedge fund, though it soon (2000) entered into traditional portfolio management. In 2009, AQR became one of the first investment managers to offer alternative mutual funds.[7]
As of July 30, 2017, the firm has $195 billion in assets under management.[1]
Ties to academia[edit]
As of 2016, approximately half of the AQR’s employees have earned advanced degrees, with 52 holding PhDs.[9] The firm is known to maintain strong, positive ties to leading universities and supports financial research through annual academic awards.
AQR’s Insight Award (see below for winners), which “recognizes the most significant and innovative academic research that offers practical applications for investors,” awarded its fifth annual slate of winners in 2016.[10]
In 2014, AQR partnered with the London Business School to establish The AQR Asset Management Institute, which focuses on asset management research and thought leadership. The Institute rewards scholars in the field with annual grants and prizes.[11]
The firm is also a sponsor of the AQR Top Finance Graduate Award at Copenhagen Business School, which honors the PhD graduates whose research carries the greatest potential impact.[12]
AQR Insight Award[edit]
AQR awards a $100,000 annual prize, the AQR Insight Award “to encourage and acknowledge academics whose research promises to be of significant use to institutional investors.”

2012 Winners: Bryan Kelly and Seth Pruitt[13]

Investment philosophy and strategies[edit]
AQR employs a research-based “systematic and consistent approach” to portfolio construction.[2] This disciplined approach of identifying long-term, repeatable sources of return means “having a high conviction in the process, but not a high conviction in any particular stock.”[2] The firm is a strong proponent of diversification within portfolios, as well as adding strategies with low correlation to traditional asset classes as a complement to existing portfolios.[3] AQR is a leader in investor and advisor education, often sharing insight into its strategies through research, white papers and events.
AQR was an early adopter of style, or factor, investing given the strategy’s academic roots. Although the four styles — value, momentum, defensive and carry — have been well-known and used in quantitative investing for decades, they’ve gained popularity in recent years under the mantle of “Smart Beta.” AQR has long advocated for using these styles together, citing their diversifying qualities. AQR reiterated its strong belief in the strategy, but objection to the name “Smart Beta” in the 2014 article, “Smart Beta: Not New, Not Beta, Still Awesome.”[4]

Investment Approach








                We invest in over 100 liquid futures and forwards contracts, both long and short, across global equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. Trades are executed based on trend-following signals that aim to go long rising markets and short falling markets. 

By establishing “long” positions in assets that we believe will rise in price, and “short” positions for assets that are expected to decline in price, this Fund seeks to benefit from both up and down price movements. 

What distinguishes AQR’s approach to managed-futures investing is our emphasis on diversification across several themes: 

Signal Types — combines short-term, long-term and overextended signals to follow trends and anticipate reversals
Investments — trades over 100 liquid contracts across four major asset classes
Risk — position sizes based on risk, allocating more capital to less-risky instruments  

AQR's proprietary trading algorithms and direct market access enable us to minimize transaction costs — another key differentiator for investors.
            





AQR Managed Futures Strategy Fund: The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund's initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. Concentration generally will lead to greater price volatility. This Fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

The Merrill Lynch 3 Month Treasury Bill Index is designed to measure the performance of high-quality short-term cash-equivalent investments. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index.


AQR Managed Futures Strategy Fund: The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund's initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. Concentration generally will lead to greater price volatility. This Fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.
Start Crowdfunding








The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

Read MoreCollapse Strategies 






The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.


Read MoreCollapse Description


Keys to Success

Nearly 7,000 social media shares
More than 40 photos and 15 videos in the fundraiser gallery showing Bonsai’s daily progress and interaction with other dogs
Local and major national news media coverage of Bonsai’s story
Fifteen fundraiser updates expressing gratitude for the support from donors and sharing news of Bonsai’s recent surgeries and status of his mobility device

FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free.
