Products - Shiloh Industries



















































Products

Shiloh’s manufacturing capabilities are material-agnostic – meaning we will design and deliver solutions in the best material to meet your product requirements. We work with aluminum, magnesium, conventional steel and advanced high-strength steels.
Body Structure & Interior Systems
Shiloh’s body structure and interior system components embody our desire to keep passengers and cargo safe while providing you a silent ride. The parts must be strong and stiff enough to withstand high loads, but designed to achieve weight reduction.
Through design optimization, we are able to engineer and manufacture durable and lightweight multi-material solutions. Using our proprietary NVH laminates, we can reduce noise and eliminate the need for additional sound-damping materials, further reducing the weight of the vehicle.
Shiloh’s solutions include: dash and floor panels; plenum; trunk floors; spare wheel and folding seat tubs; door systems; wheelhouse; roof panels; instrument panel beams; seat supports; seat back frames; seat risers and center console frames.

Chassis Systems
Shiloh’s chassis systems provide a strong foundation for the vehicle’s driveline and body. These systems require high strength to support and transfer loads through the body of the vehicle.
Our aluminum squeeze casting process produces high integrity thick-walled components that can replace cast iron, offering an efficient, durable and lightweight solution. Laser welded blanks can offer weight reduction in frames without compromising strength.
Shiloh’s solutions include: cross members; frame rails; axle carriers, tubes, covers, housings; bearing caps; clutch housings; brake components; steering column housings; knuckles; links; master cylinders.

Powertrain Systems
Shiloh’s powertrain systems offers OEMs and suppliers sustainable multi-material solutions to reduce weight, noise and vibration.
Using our advanced engineering design and simulation capabilities we can provide the optimum solution for every product, whether it is cast, stamped or a complex assembly incorporating both, with the added benefit of noise and vibration reduction using our proprietary NVH laminates.
Shiloh’s solutions include: planetary carriers; clutch housings; transmission gear housings; engine valve covers; valve bodies; rocker arm spacers; heat shields; exhaust manifolds; cones; baffles; mufflers shields; engine oil pans; transmission fluid pans; front covers; transmissions covers.

About Us - Shiloh Industries






















































About Us

About
Safe
Silent
Strong
Sustainable



Shiloh Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: SHLO) is a global innovative solutions provider focusing on lightweighting technologies that provide environmental and safety benefits to the mobility market.  The Company designs and manufactures products within body structure, chassis and powertrain systems, leveraging one of the broadest portfolios in the industry.
Shiloh’s multi-component, multi-material solutions are comprised of a variety of alloys in aluminum, magnesium and steel grades, along with its proprietary line of noise and vibration reducing ShilohCore acoustic laminate products.  The strategic BlankLight®, CastLight® and StampLight® brands combine to maximize lightweighting solutions without compromising safety or performance.
The Company has over 3,600 dedicated employees with operations, sales and technical centers throughout Asia, Europe and North America.
Lightweighting Without Compromise®


Safety is something we take seriously at Shiloh. In fact, it is one of our hallmarks. Our products are designed and manufactured with the highest precision to meet or exceed the strictest quality standards in the industry. Our cross-functional teams and dedicated safety managers ensure all projects meet TS16949 and APQP standards, ensuring only the highest quality design, development and production.
To ensure our products are of the highest quality, our engineers use our proprietary technologies to test and validate parts in accordance with our quality control standards. We test thermal and fatigue requirements (FEA) and fluid dynamics (CFD), along with metallurgical, spectrological and tensile/compression to offer the highest quality lightweight products without compromising strength and safety.


Our products are highly engineered to add the required strength where necessary, while reducing material weight where it is only required. We also offer dynamic testing of materials through our industry partners for added validation for specific customer needs.
We use only high-purity, high-ductility alloys, which includes alloy modification to attain the best mix of castability, die life, strength and stiffness.


Reducing vehicle weight is one of the automotive industry’s greatest opportunities to improve fuel efficiency and economy, and lightweighting can help ensure automakers met those increasingly tougher standards. However, reducing vehicle mass can magnify noise and vibration being transmitted into the vehicle’s interior. To alleviate this obstacle, our patented ShilohCore acoustic laminate solutions can reduce interior noise by up to 2dB in many applications.
Developed from our proprietary chemistry and manufacturing processes, our patented ShilohCore acoustic laminate is a viscoelastic constrained layer application that dampens noise and vibration, and minimizes costs without adding unnecessary mass.


Sustainability is at the core of our business model. Automakers are under increased pressure and various government demands to meet and exceed the ever-increasing global emission standards in an effort to decrease greenhouse gases. To aid in this initiative, our innovative lightweighting technologies improve material consumption and CO2 emissions through the reduction of part weight and overall vehicle weight, resulting in an increase in vehicle fuel efficiency.
Adding to our sustainability efforts, we go to great lengths to ensure our manufacturing processes and products are designed to reduce landfill waste. As a result, over half of our facilities are landfill-free, with the goal that all our capable facilities will be landfill-free by 2020.

Die Casting

Die casting is a versatile process for producing engineered metal parts by forcing molten metal under high pressure into reusable steel molds. These molds, called dies, can be designed to produce complex shapes with a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. Parts can be sharply defined, with smooth or textured surfaces, and are suitable for a wide variety of attractive and serviceable finishes.
Our team of Machine Operators, Process Control Technicians, and Quality Personnel all work together to ensure our casting machine output meets or exceeds industry standards and customer specifications. We also perform a variety of secondary operations such as sanding, milling, drilling, tapping and assembly; as well as working with several top notch commercial painters. View all Secondary Operations capabilities.


Tooling Operations
Spectron manufactures prototype, low volume, and production die cast tooling. Our experienced, skilled team of CAD/CAM engineers and tooling professionals deliver quality tooling solutions for today’s demanding manufacturing environment.

Production Tooling
Hard tool or H-13 die cast tooling is an excellent process for higher quantity requirements. A larger upfront tooling investment yields a significant reduction in re-occurring costs. Production die cast parts have highly repeatable properties and tolerances.

Typical Lead Time

Tooling = 4 weeks
Samples = 1-2 weeks
Production (Qty 10k) = 3-4 weeks



Tooling Life Expectancy

300k shots













Prototype Tooling
The term “Soft Tool” is used to describe a die cast tool made out of P-20 steel. The P-20 steel is softer than H-13 steel and thus yields parts in less time with a decrease in tooling cost attributed to the ability to run faster feed rates when CNC machining the tool. Typically a P-20 tool can yield 10,000-40,000 parts before showing any significant wear.

Typical Lead Time

Tooling = 2 weeks
Samples = 1-2 weeks
Production (Qty 100) = 3-5 days



Tooling Life Expectancy

10k shots




Materials
We routinely pour a broad range non-ferrous materials. The following are some of the most common alloys being used:

Aluminum die casting alloys: A380, A360, A356, and K-Alloy
Magnesium die casting alloys include AZ91D and AM60B
Zinc die casting alloys include ZA3, ZA12, and ZA27
Copper alloy die castings

Design Criteria

As cast tolerance as tight as +/- .005”, post machining available for tighter tolerance applications.
Standard tolerance of +/- .010” for the first inch and +/-.002” each additional inch.
Typical surface finish of Ra 63-125 micro-inch as cast, post machining available for higher quality finishes.
Minimum draft = .5 degrees
Minimum wall thickness = .030” (Thinner wall thickness possible with alternative processes)









What our customers say

“Without Spectron our project would not have been as successful as it was. They demonstrated the teamwork, knowledge, and ‘can-do’ attitude needed to pull off a difficult order.”

PLYMOUTH, Mich., July  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An industry leader in lightweighting, Shiloh Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLO) has reduced the weight of a solid rear beam axle housing by 11 kilograms or 24 pounds.
Utilizing our proprietary, cutting-edge casting technology, Shiloh engineers were able to reduce the part weight of a traditional cast iron rear beam axle housing by over 40%, creating one of the lightest pickup truck solid beam axle housings in the industry.  This innovative design also reduces secondary machining operations saving production time and cost, without compromising strength or performance. “We believe we are the first in the industry able to produce a pickup truck rear beam axle housing in aluminum,” said David Jaeger, senior vice president and managing director, CastLight. “This exciting new product is another example of Shiloh’s unique ability to develop innovative lightweighting technologies while assisting our customers in optimizing the strength, weight and performance attributes of their vehicles.” Shiloh customized the chassis component for an OEM to further reduce weight on the launch of their 2019 model year light duty pickup trucks. About Shiloh Industries: Shiloh Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLO) is a global innovative solutions provider focusing on lightweighting technologies that provide environmental and safety benefits to the mobility market.  The Company designs and manufactures products within body structure, chassis and powertrain systems, leveraging one of the broadest portfolios in the industry. Shiloh’s multi-component, multi-material solutions are comprised of a variety of alloys in aluminum, magnesium and steel grades, along with its proprietary line of noise and vibration reducing ShilohCore acoustic laminate products.  The strategic BlankLight®, CastLight® and StampLight® brands combine to maximize lightweighting solutions without compromising safety or performance. The company has over 3,600 dedicated employees with operations, sales and technical centers throughout Asia, Europe and North America.  Hilary Brazin
