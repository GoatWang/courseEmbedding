2017 Shareholder Presentation

Please review the 2017 Shareholder Presentation, here.





Parkside’s 1st Quarter Review

2017 is off to a strong start at Parkside! Total banking assets of $418 million reflect an increase of $44 million from March of last year and total wealth management assets under management of nearly $1.15 billion reflect an increase of $192 million during the same period. Continued…





Important Topics from Parkside

February 2017
After being around for a century, will the Estate Tax go away?
The federal estate tax, enacted in 1916 to help pay for WWI, turned 100 years old in 2016. Today it affects approximately 5,000 estates, or about 0.2% of all estate returns filed annually, and generates an estimated $17 billion in tax revenue. Inflation raised the exemption from $5.45 million to $5.49 million ($11.98 million for married couples) in 2017. President Trump has vowed to repeal the estate tax, but has yet to provide the complete details of his plan. As a result, it is unclear how this would impact the gift tax (what you can give away while you are alive) which currently shares the same exemption amount as the estate tax.

ZBA – Zero balance accounts allow you to concentrate your funds from multiple accounts for added control over your cash resources. All disbursements out of your ZBA will automatically fund from a “master” account and will leave the disbursement account at a zero balance each business day. This greatly reduces idle balances that can now be invested or used to pay down loans.
Positive Pay – With our positive pay service you greatly reduce the chance of significant loss due to stolen or fraudulently created checks. One out of three businesses experience check fraud with an average loss of over $10,000. Whenever checks are issued, you would provide us with an issue file that contains the check number and check amount of all checks issued. We would then match the file against incoming checks and advise you of any discrepant items. You would then, via our online banking, view the check image and make the decision to return or not return the check.
