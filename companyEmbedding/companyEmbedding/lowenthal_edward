At Lowenthal & Abrams, we help people like you every day who need help getting their benefits. Whether are filing for the first time, or have been denied and need assistance with an appeal, we will walk you through the SSDI process and fight for the benefits to which you are entitled.



 


Firm Philosophy



How did your firm decide on the primary area of practice(s)?
When Jeff Lowenthal founded Lowenthal & Abrams in 1975, it was specifically with the goal of helping those who have been injured and need help. As the firm has grown, it has attracted attorneys who have the same philosophy.




What experience or education distinguishes your lawyers from others
Many of our lawyers have substantial experience in the practice of law. Included among our attorneys are a doctor and a lawyer who use their medical knowledge to negotiate settlements and try cases at an extremely high level.




What distinguishes your law firm from others?
We have fourteen lawyers on our team. We are not afraid to try cases when insurance companies refuse to offer fair settlements.  Knowing this, insurance companies treat us differently.
