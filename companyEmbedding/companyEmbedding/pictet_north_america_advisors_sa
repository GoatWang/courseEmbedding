Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

About Pictet North America Advisors SA

Pictet North America Advisors SA (PNAA) has been created to meet the needs of US nationals and taxpayers who face specific legal and investment constraints.

















PartnershipOur core values of independence, excellence, integrity and respect have ensured that our clients’ needs are the focus of all our activities. We take a long-term view in our investment philosophy, and we recruit talented individuals whom we intend to retain for decades.
Based in Geneva, one of the world’s foremost financial centres for private banking, we are able to offer you Switzerland’s renowned asset management expertise. Our investment capabilities span the globe, and our international outlook provides you with the know-how needed to invest around the world.
Since 2007, Pictet North America Advisors has been registered as an investment advisor with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. And despite being Geneva-based, our staff keep in close contact with US clients through frequent visits to the US, as well as by telephone and email.



Although Pictet North America Advisors is a separate company, it is wholly owned by the Pictet Group, one of Europe’s leading independent wealth and asset managers. Since its foundation in 1805, Pictet has remained single-minded in its mission to advise private clients, families and institutions in the complex business of protecting and enhancing their wealth. Over more than two centuries of sometimes stormy European history, Pictet has grown organically into a truly international asset management business.
Switzerland, our home country, is an ideal base for asset management. Well-known for its political and financial stability, it is top-ranked by the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report and has a highly educated workforce. Perhaps because it is a small and entrepreneurial country, Swiss business leaders have always looked outside their borders and have built companies that are global leaders in many industries. There is no better country from which to plan the global diversification of your investment portfolio.

We are committed to ensuring that our relationship with you is founded on a genuine and long-lasting partnership
