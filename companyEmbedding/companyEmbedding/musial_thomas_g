Title: Senior Vice President - Human Resources and Administration
               Company: Austal Limited
Job Details
               The company is also committed to the construction of two large, North Sea-type platform supply vessels and 11 next generation supply vessels, ranging in size from 205-foot to 220-foot, for approximately $162.1 million. The two large platform supply vessels, designed and equipped for deepwater work, are being built in Brazil. The company's shipyard, Quality Shipyard, LLC, will construct two of the next generation supply vessels. Five of the remaining nine next generation supply vessels will be constructed by one U.S. shipyard while a different U.S. shipyard will construct the remaining four vessels. The 11 vessels are intermediate in size and are technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets; however, these vessels are being constructed in order to replace older supply vessels. Scheduled delivery of the 13 vessels is expected to commence in October 2002 with final delivery in May 2004. As of September 30, 2002, $64.7 million has been expended on these vessels. In September 2001, the company assumed four new-build contracts from Crewboats, Inc., a privately held, leading independent provider of crewboat services in the Gulf of Mexico, for approximately $20.7 million. One of the vessels was delivered to the market during the current quarter for an approximate cost of $5.1 million. Scheduled delivery for the remaining three crewboats is expected to commence in November 2002 with final delivery in November 2003. No amounts have been expended on the remaining three crewboats of the total $15.6 commitment cost, as the individual vessels' purchase prices are due upon delivery of the respective vessels. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the company committed $25.5 million to the construction of four, 175-foot, state-of-the-art, fast, crew/supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel. The four crewboats are being constructed at a U.S. shipyard and scheduled delivery of the four crewboats is expected to commence in November 2002, with final delivery in October 2003. As of September 30, 2002, $1.6 million has been expended on these vessels. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the company entered into an agreement with a shipyard in Holland to construct two water jet crewboats for an approximate cost of $1.9 million. The two vessels are scheduled for delivery in August 2003. No amounts have been expended on the vessels as of September 30, 2002. Now reflect that 33 new vessels represents only about 6% of Tidewater's fleet, the average age of which is still around 20. If you have a fleet of 560 vessels, you need to be replacing about 20 of them every year, on average. Seems like there must be more new construction to come. Tim Colton, October 22, 2002. ANOTHER FINE OLD SHIP, THE ICEBREAKER " GLACIER", IS SAVED FROM THE BREAKERS. After three years of effort, the Glacier Society has finally reached agreement with MARAD and the icebreaker "Glacier" (WAGB 4) will be moved next month from the Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay to a mooring first at the former Mare Island Naval Ship Yard and later in Bridgeport CT, where she will be restored and will become a "platform for scientific and environmental education and research". Glacier was built by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, (hull # 580), at 8,650 tons the largest purpose-built polar icebreaker ever built by a U.S. shipyard, much larger than the seven "Wind"-class icebreakers built by Western Pipe & Steel at the end of WWII. She was commissioned as USS Glacier (AGB 4) on May 27, 1955, transferred to the Coast Guard in 1966 as USCGC Glacier (WAGB 4) and retired in 1985. On her maiden voyage, she served as Admiral Byrd's flagship and in 30 years of service made 29 trips to the Antarctic and 10 to the Arctic, steaming almost a million nautical miles. There are great pictures of Glacier and other USCG icebreakers at www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/history/Icebreaker_Photo_Index_1.html . Visit www.glaciersociety.org, send them money - they need a whole lot - and, if you live in the San Francisco Bay area, go and help. Tim Colton, October 9, 2002 .
