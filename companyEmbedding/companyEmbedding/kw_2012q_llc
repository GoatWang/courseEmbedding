Project:
Fall / Spring Yard Clean Up



With all of the rain NY has been having my yard looked like a rainforest. Price and his team came in and I can now point to my yard with pride - not despair. He is scheduled to return for some minor work but I intend to keep his company for the duration of the summer ahead.

Project:
Install or Replace Landscape Curbing



This is my second time using Mr. Price's service. He planted fall window boxes and created a beautiful tree bed. People stop and marvel over his work and want his contact information. His service is top notch and very reasonable. It is obvious he has a passion for his work.

Project:
Landscape a Back Yard



Price was Amazing and his team so beyond professional! 
I have been dramatized with a few workers that have worked for us and luckily I can say these were the good batch of the great ones!!! the place was left immaculate clean after they left just as it should be.  His team beyond professional knows the topic to ask first before proceeding with what they think is good and not confirming with me.  So friendly and whatever you ask it just gets done.   My backyard and front of my home looks like it stepped out of a magazine cover and that's the look I wanted!!! Love them!!!!

Project:
Install Sod



This project deserves 10 stars!   Five doesn't do it justice. Most professional sod installation we've ever had!  In addition to the sod installation, the company upgraded our small urban garden with additional flowers and installed the most beautiful street tree pit EVER!  All this beauty for a very fair price.  We were so impressed with the job they did, we've hired them to come back and do our window boxes.  We've used professional landscapers for many years, but  KW Price is the BEST in NYC.

100% top-notch work and service. Extremely fair pricing. We have a small garden area which needed a complete overhaul. We spoke about what he thought we may want to consider and he came up with a few recommendations. We truly relied on KW Price for their expertise. The work was quick, efficient and impeccable they left my property spotless. After a day, I noticed that some of the plants they incorporated into the design weren't too happy. they came right out the next day and replaced them.  I would HIGHLY recommend KW Price, without question!

KW Price was excellent!   They price was very reasonable.   They came to my urban backyard and trimmed my tree my neighbors tree growing over my backyard and carted all the debris off the property.  They left the backyard very clean.  I would hire them again.

KW Price reached out to me right away and had a proposal in my hands one day later. I put him in touch with my father who needed the services.  I'm not too keen on findings services on line, but i would not hesiitate if the service is anywhere near KW Prices.  He is professional, prompt, and got the job done within 2 days.  I absolutely love the finish product.  He did all that we spoke about and now the family has a beautifully landscaped yard to enjoy.  It was ugly and scarey before KW Price. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE WHO ASK.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate. Therefore, we recommend that before working with a service professional you verify that information presented is still current and/or acceptable to you.

**Only for U.S. service professionals 
















            HomeAdvisor's Screening Process
         
HomeAdvisor uses the following criteria to screen service professionals at the time they apply for membership in our network:







Licensing
Applicants must carry required state-level licensing to perform work in the trade and service area for which they apply.




Sex Offender Search
We check the official sex offender website in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match with the applicant.




Legal Search for Civil Judgments
We use third-party data sources to check the principal/owner of each business for bankruptcy filings and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, occurring within 12 months prior to application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network.






Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.




Identity Verification (Social Security Number)
HomeAdvisor verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)







            Notification to residents of AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, WY: HomeAdvisor uses a third party to screen professionals.

	information, you should not rely on it. This prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement do not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities other than the registered securities to which they relate, and
	this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction where, or to any person to whom, it is unlawful to make such an offer or

	RISK FACTORS





	An investment in the securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the material risks incorporated by
	reference in this prospectus, including the risk factors set forth in Kennedy-Wilson Holdings most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, together with the other information contained in
	this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement before making a decision to invest in the securities. If any of the risks occur, the applicable issuers business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely
	affected. In that event, the trading price of the securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This prospectus also contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and
	uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks incorporated by reference in this prospectus. For more information, see the sections

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS





	This prospectus is part of a shelf registration statement that the issuers have filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, or SEC. Under this shelf registration process, the issuers may sell securities, from time to time, in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $350,000,000 or its equivalent in a foreign currency based on the exchange rate at
	the time of sale. This prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities that may be offered, which is not meant to be a complete description of each security. Each time securities are sold, a prospectus supplement containing
	specific information about the terms of that offering will be provided, including the specific amounts, prices and terms of the securities offered. The prospectus supplement and any other offering material may also add to, update or change
	information contained in this prospectus or in documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus. You are urged to read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement and any other offering material (including a free writing prospectus)
	prepared by or on behalf of the applicable issuer for a specific offering of securities, together with additional information described under the heading Where You Can Find Additional Information on page 4 of this prospectus. You should
	rely only on the information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement and in any authorized free writing prospectus. Neither issuer has authorized anyone to provide you with different information. The
	issuers are not making an offer to sell or soliciting an offer to purchase these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.




	The issuers may offer the securities directly, through agents, or to or through underwriters or dealers. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of the plan of distribution and set
	forth the names of any underwriters involved in the sale of the securities. See Plan of Distribution beginning on page 26 for more information on this topic. No securities may be sold without delivery of a prospectus supplement
	describing the method and terms of the offering of those securities.

	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	Statements made by in this prospectus and in other reports and statements released by either issuer that are not
	historical facts constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are necessary estimates reflecting
	the judgment of senior management based on current estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections and include comments that express current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Disclosures that use words
	such as believe, anticipate, estimate, intend, could, plan, expect, project or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to
	identify forward-looking statements.




	Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, rely on a number of
	assumptions concerning future events, many of which are outside of the issuers control, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievement, or industry results, to differ
	materially from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although the issuers believe that their plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested
	by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider the
	risks referred to under the heading Risk Factors on page 1 of this prospectus, and in the reports Kennedy-Wilson Holdings files from time to time with the SEC and incorporates by reference herein, including, but not limited to, the
	following factors:



	 





	 




	




	 





	disruptions in general economic and business conditions, particularly in geographies where the issuers respective businesses may be concentrated;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the continued volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a
	reduction in the availability of mortgage loans and mezzanine financing, all of which could increase costs and could limit the issuers ability to acquire additional real estate assets;






	 





	 




	




	 





	continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuers leverage and ability to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;






	 





	 




	




	 





	an increase in the issuers debt service obligations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuers ability to generate a sufficient amount of cash from operations to satisfy working capital requirements and to service their existing
	and future indebtedness;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuers ability to achieve improvements in operating efficiency;






	 





	 




	




	 





	foreign currency fluctuations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	adverse changes in the securities markets;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuers ability to retain their senior management and attract and retain qualified and experienced employees;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuers ability to attract new user and investor clients;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuers ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;






	 





	 




	




	 





	trends in use of large, full-service commercial real estate providers;






	 





	 




	




	 





	changes in tax laws in the United States, Europe or Japan that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits the issuers receive;

	




	 





	future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	costs relating to the acquisition of assets the issuers may acquire could be higher than anticipated.







	Any such forward-looking statements, whether made in this prospectus or elsewhere, should be considered in the context of
	the various disclosures made by the issuers about their respective businesses including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed above. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, none of the
	issuers intends or has an obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise.

	securities for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, repayment or refinancing of debt, additions to working capital, capital expenditures, investments in its subsidiaries, stock repurchases and other business
	opportunities. The applicable issuer will have significant discretion in the use of any net proceeds. Additional information about the use of the net proceeds from the sale of securities may be provided in an applicable prospectus supplement or

	The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed
	charges, as defined. For this purpose, earnings consist of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and equity in income of joint ventures plus operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed
	charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense. For the nine months ended
	September 30, 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2011, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges, and the deficiency of earnings was $2.2 million, $6.5 million,
	$21.1 million, $9.5 million, and $13.6 million, respectively.




	The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges
	and preferred stock dividends is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed charges, as defined. For this purpose, earnings and fixed charges have the respective meanings assigned above. Preferred stock
	dividends refers to preferred dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2011, 2009, 2008 and 2007, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were
	insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, and the deficiency of earnings was $8.2 million, $15.3 million, $21.1 million, $9.5 million and $13.6 million, respectively.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES





	This prospectus contains summary descriptions of the common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and guarantees that may be

	DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK





	Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us,
	our or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.




	Our second amended
	and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of October 31, 2012, 63,772,598 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock have
	exclusive voting rights for the election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that alter or change the powers,
	preferences, rights or other terms of any outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be
	voted on by stockholders and also are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the
	common stock will be subject to (i) the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock, and (ii) compliance with any applicable limitations in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this
	prospectus and any prospectus supplement. Our common stock has no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock.




	Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of
	directors being elected in each year. A plurality of the votes cast at a stockholders meeting is sufficient to elect any director into office. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors.

	DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK





	Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us,
	our or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.






	General.


	Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of
	preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or preferred stock. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is
	authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, the designations, powers, and preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions, applicable to the shares of each series of
	preferred stock. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have
	anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control or the removal of existing management by diluting the
	stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of the company or remove existing management. As of October 31, 2012, 100,000 shares of our series A preferred stock were issued and outstanding and 32,550 shares of
	our series B preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Other than the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock, no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding.




	The specific terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to that
	class or series, including a prospectus supplement providing that preferred stock may be issuable upon the exercise of warrants, or upon the conversion of any debt securities, that we issue pursuant to this prospectus. The description of preferred
	stock set forth below and the description of the terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
	articles supplementary relating to that class or series.




	The preferences and other terms of the preferred stock of each class
	or series will be fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such class or series. A prospectus supplement, relating to each class or series, will specify the terms of the preferred stock as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the title and stated value of such preferred stock;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the number of shares of such preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of such preferred stock;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the dividend rate(s), period(s), and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation thereof applicable to such preferred stock;






	 





	 




	




	 





	whether such preferred stock is cumulative or not and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on such preferred stock shall accumulate;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the provision for a sinking fund, if any, for such preferred stock;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the provision for redemption, if applicable, of such preferred stock;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any listing of such preferred stock on any securities exchange;






	 





	 




	




	 





	preemptive rights, if any;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which such preferred stock will be converted into our common stock, including the conversion price (or
	manner of calculation thereof);






	 





	 




	

	Rank.


	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will, with respect to
	dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, rank: (i) senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the
	preferred stock; (ii) on parity with any class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the preferred stock; and (iii) junior to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking senior to
	the preferred stock.






	Conversion Rights.


	The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any shares of any class or
	series of preferred stock are convertible into our common stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement relating thereto. Such terms will include the number of shares of our common stock into which the shares of preferred stock are
	convertible, the conversion price (or manner of calculation thereof), the conversion period, provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of such class or series of preferred stock, the events requiring an adjustment of
	the conversion price and provisions affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of such class or series of preferred stock.






	Power to Increase Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Our Preferred Stock.


	The number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased by the affirmative vote of the
	holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred
	Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the resolutions adopted by the board of directors for such series. Our board of directors has the power to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our
	preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of our preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock. Although our board of directors does not intend to do so, it could authorize us
	to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in
	their best interest.






	Dividend Limitations.


	The payment of dividends, if ever, on the preferred stock will be
	subject to compliance with any applicable limitations in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement.

	Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets





	The applicable issuer may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its
	properties and assets to any person (a successor person) unless:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the applicable issuer is the surviving person or the successor person (if other than the applicable issuer) is a person that is organized and validly
	existing under the laws of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes the applicable issuers obligations on the debt securities and under the applicable indenture; and

	immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing;







	Notwithstanding the above, any subsidiaries of the applicable issuer may consolidate with, merge into or

	Events of Default





	

	Event of Default

	 means with respect to any series of debt securities, any of the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a default in the payment of any interest upon any debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a
	period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is deposited by the applicable issuer with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);






	 





	 




	




	 





	a default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, if, when and as due by the terms of the debt securities of that series, and the continuance of
	such default for a period of 60 days;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by the applicable issuer (or, in the case the debt securities of that series
	are subject to a guarantee, the guarantor of such guarantee) in the applicable indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been included in the applicable indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that
	series), which default continues uncured for a period of 60 days after the applicable issuer receives written notice from the trustee or the applicable issuer and the trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than 25% in principal
	amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series as provided in the applicable indenture;






	 





	 




	




	 





	if the debt securities of such series are subject to a guarantee of a guarantor, such guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any
	reason be asserted in writing by such guarantor or the applicable issuer not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated or permitted by the applicable indenture or the terms of the
	debt securities of that series;






	 





	 




	




	 





	certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the applicable issuer; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any other Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement.







	No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of debt securities (except as to certain events of
	bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the applicable indenture may constitute
	an event of default under certain other indebtedness of the applicable issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.




	 




	21







	Table of Contents




	If an Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series at the time outstanding
	occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may, by a notice in writing to the applicable issuer (and to the trustee if given by the holders),
	declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series), and any premium and accrued and
	unpaid interest on, all debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of, and any premium and accrued and unpaid
	interest on, all outstanding debt securities of the applicable series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding debt securities. At any time after a
	declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
	debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default (other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium and interest, if any, with respect to debt securities of that series) have been cured or
	waived as provided in the applicable indenture. You are referred to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration of a portion of the principal
	amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.




	The applicable indenture will provide that the
	trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense which might be incurred by it in exercising
	such right of power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
	any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series.




	No holder of any debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the applicable indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or
	trustee, or for any remedy under the applicable indenture, unless:



	 





	 




	




	 





	that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to debt securities of that series; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request, and offered
	reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to institute the proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has (x) not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series a
	direction inconsistent with that request and (y) failed to institute the proceeding within 60 days.







	Notwithstanding any other provision in the applicable indenture, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional
	right to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.




	The applicable indenture will require the applicable issuer to, within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year, furnish to the trustee
	a statement as to compliance with the applicable indenture. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and is known to a responsible officer of the trustee, then the trustee must mail to
	each holder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. The applicable indenture will provide that the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any series of any
	Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any debt securities of that series) with respect to debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is in the interest of the holders of those debt
	securities.

	Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain
	Circumstances







	Legal Defeasance



	.





	The applicable indenture will provide that, unless
	otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities, the applicable issuer and the guarantors, if any, will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding debt securities of any series on
	the 91st day after the date of the deposit referred to below, and the provisions of the applicable indenture, as it relates to such outstanding debt securities of such series, will no longer be in effect, except as to certain specified rights,
	powers, immunities and provisions. In order to effect such legal defeasance, the following conditions, among others, must be satisfied:



	 





	 




	




	 





	subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or
	cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to
	be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment
	bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms
	of the applicable indenture and those debt securities; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the applicable indenture or any other agreement or instrument
	to which the applicable issuer is a party or by which it is bound;






	 





	 




	




	 





	no default or Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or
	during the period ending on the 91st day after such date; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the applicable issuer or guarantor(s), as
	applicable, have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the applicable indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either
	case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and
	discharge and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred.









	Defeasance of Certain Covenants



	.





	The applicable indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided
	by the terms of the applicable series of debt securities, upon compliance with certain conditions:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the applicable issuer and, if applicable, may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
	Assets and certain other covenants set forth in the applicable indenture, as well as any additional covenants which may be described in the applicable prospectus supplement; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any omission to comply with those covenants, or with certain other Events of Default, will not constitute a default or an Event of Default with respect
	to the debt securities of that series (covenant defeasance).







	 




	25







	Table of Contents




	The conditions include the following, among others:



	 





	 




	




	 





	subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or
	cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to
	be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment
	bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms
	of the applicable indenture and those debt securities; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debt securities of that
	series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same
	times as would have been the case if the deposit and related covenant defeasance had not occurred.









	Covenant Defeasance and Events of Default



	.





	In the event the applicable issuer exercises its option to
	effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of debt securities, and the debt securities of that series are declared due and payable immediately following an acceleration after the occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of money or
	U.S. government obligations or foreign government obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that series at the time of their stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due
	on the debt securities of that series at the time of such acceleration. However, the applicable issuer shall remain liable for those payments.





	Governing Law





	The
	applicable indenture and the debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the applicable indenture or the securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws
	provisions thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION





	The issuers may sell the securities domestically or abroad to one or more underwriters for public offering and sale by them or may sell
	the securities to investors directly or through dealers or agents, or through a combination of methods. Any underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer and sale of the securities will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	Underwriters may offer and sell the securities at: (i) a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, (ii) market
	prices prevailing at the time of sale, (iii) prices related to the prevailing market prices at the time of sale or (iv) negotiated prices. The issuers also may, from time to time, authorize underwriters acting as their agents to offer and
	sell the securities upon the terms and conditions as are set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from the applicable issuer in the form of
	underwriting discounts or commissions and may also receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of
	discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.




	Any underwriting compensation paid by an issuer to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to
	participating dealers, will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any
	profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with any of the issuers, to
	indemnification against and contribution toward civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Any indemnification agreement will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	Unless specified otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, any series of securities issued hereunder will be a new issue with no
	established trading market (other than Kennedy-Wilson Holdings common stock, which is listed on the NYSE). If Kennedy-Wilson Holdings sells any shares of its common stock pursuant to a prospectus supplement, such shares will be listed on the
	NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The issuers may elect to list any other securities issued hereunder on any exchange, but the issuers are not obligated to do so. Any underwriters or agents to or through whom such securities are sold for
	public offering and sale may make a market in such securities, but such underwriters or agents will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the
	trading market for any such securities.




	If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the issuers may authorize
	underwriters or other persons acting as the issuers agents to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities from the issuers at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant
	to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated in the prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment
	companies and educational and charitable institutions. Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the
	laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts.




	To facilitate the offering of the securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize,
	maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than the issuers sold to them. In these
	circumstances, these persons would cover the over-allotments or

	short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding
	for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization
	transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time. In

	ITEM 15. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS






	Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.





	Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides as follows:





	SEVENTH.





	1. Actions, Suits and
	Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the Corporation.




	The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a
	party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the
	fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another
	corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an Indemnitee), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in
	such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal
	therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
	settlement, conviction or upon a action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith
	and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding
	anything to the contrary in this Article, except as set forth in Section 6 below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the
	initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.




	2. Actions of Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation.




	The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
	pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has
	agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or




	 




	II-1







	Table of Contents




	in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken
	or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
	if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall
	have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action of suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such
	liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware of such other court shall deem proper.




	3. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party.




	Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections
	I and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
	him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to
	the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he
	reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee
	shall be considered for the purpose hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.




	4. Notification and Defense of Claim.




	As a condition precedent to his right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as
	practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be
	entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume
	such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have
	the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless
	(i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between
	the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for
	the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the
	right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.




	5. Advance of Expenses.




	Subject to the provisions of Section 6 below, in the
	event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article, any expenses (including attorneys
	fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in




	 




	II-2







	Table of Contents




	defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided,
	however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event
	that it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such
	repayment.




	6. Procedure for Indemnification.




	In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such
	request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such
	indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the
	Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each
	instance by (i) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (disinterested directors), even though less than a quorum, (ii) if there are no
	such disinterested directors, or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, (iii) a majority vote of a quorum of the outstanding shares of
	stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, or (iv) the Delaware Court of Chancery.




	7. Remedies.




	The
	right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within
	the 60-day period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither
	the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination
	by the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The
	Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.




	8. Subsequent Amendment.




	No
	amendment, termination or repeal of this Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification
	under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal.




	9. Other Rights.




	The
	indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled




	 




	II-3







	Table of Contents




	under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity
	while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in
	this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In
	addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time (0 time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be
	equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article.




	10. Partial Indemnification.




	If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the
	expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not,
	however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.




	11. Insurance.




	The
	Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
	benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
	under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.




	12. Merger or Consolidation.




	If the Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the
	surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of
	such merger or consolidation.



	 





	13.




	Savings Clause.






	If this Article
	or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
	in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by an applicable portion of this
	Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.




	14. Definitions.




	Terms used herein and defined in Section l45(h) and Section l45(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the
	respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section l45(h) and Section l45(i).




	 




	II-4







	Table of Contents




	15. Subsequent Legislation.




	If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such
	persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended.




	Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.s Amended and Restated By-Laws provides as follows:




	Article VII.Indemnification.




	7.1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
	administrative or investigative (a Proceeding), by reason of being or having been a director or officer of the Corporation or serving or having served at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent
	of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an Indemnitee), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action or failure to act in
	an official capacity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
	authorized by the Delaware GCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior
	thereto) (as used in this Article 7, the Delaware Law), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
	suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs,
	executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in §7.2 hereof with respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or
	part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article 7 shall be a contract right and shall include
	the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an Advancement of Expenses); provided, however, that, if the Delaware
	Law so requires, an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an Undertaking), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
	shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a Final Adjudication) that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article 7 or otherwise.




	7.2. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under §7.1 hereof is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty
	(60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
	against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the
	Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a

	liability or loss under this Article 7 or under the Delaware Law.




	7.5. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
	Corporation. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the Advancement of Expenses, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
	provisions of this Article 7 with respect to the indemnification and Advancement of Expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

	indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such

	action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in
	approving a settlement.




	(i) Upon and in the event of a determination-by the Board of Directors to purchase such insurance,
	this Corporation shall purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the Corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agents status as such whether or not this

	The subsidiary guarantors that are California corporations are subject to the provisions of the California Corporations Code (the CCC). Section 317 of the CCC authorizes a corporation to
	indemnify a person who is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any suit (other than a suit by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was the corporations director or officer, or is or was
	serving at the corporations request as a director or officer of another entity, for expenses (including attorneys fees) and other liabilities actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with any such suit, provided such
	person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to criminal actions, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Section 317 provides
	further that a corporation may indemnify a director or officer for expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of a suit by or in the right of the corporation, provided such
	person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best

	interests of the corporation and its shareholders. To the extent a corporations director or officer is successful on the merits in the defense of any such suit, that person shall be
	indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred. Under Section 317 of the CCC, expenses incurred in defending any suit may be advanced by the corporation prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of any
	undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay that amount if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.




	The Articles of Incorporation of each of K-W Properties, K-W Santiago Inc., Kennedy-Wilson Tech Ltd. and KWP Financial I provides as follows:




	FIVE: The corporation is authorized to indemnify the directors and officers of the corporation to the fullest extent permissible
	under California law.




	The Articles of Incorporation of Kennedy-Wilson Capital provides as follows:




	ARTICLE SIX: The corporation is authorized to indemnify the directors, officers, employees and agents of the corporation to the
	fullest extent permissible under California law.




	The Articles of Incorporation of each of each of Kennedy Wilson
	Auction Group Inc., Kennedy-Wilson International and KW Residential Group, Inc. are silent with respect to indemnification.




	The Bylaws of each of K-W Properties, K-W Santiago Inc., Kennedy-Wilson Tech Ltd., KWP Financial I, Kennedy Wilson Auction Group Inc. and
	KW Residential Group, Inc. provides as follows:




	Article II, Section 5: Indemnification of Directors, Officers,
	Employees and Agents




	The corporation may indemnify any Director, Officer, agent or employee as to those liabilities and on
	those terms and conditions as are specified in Section 317. In any event, the corporation shall have the right to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such persons whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
	such person against the liability insured against.




	The Bylaws of each of Kennedy-Wilson International are silent with
	respect to indemnification.




	The Bylaws of Kennedy-Wilson Capital provides as follows:




	ARTICLE VI. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS.




	Section 1. AGENTS, PROCEEDINGS, AND EXPENSES. For the purposes of this Article, agent means any person who is or was a
	director, officer, employee, or other agent of this corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of this corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or
	other enterprise, or who was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation that was a predecessor corporation of this corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation;
	proceeding means any threatened, pending, or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative; and expenses includes, without limitation, attorney fees and any expenses of establishing
	a right to indemnification under Section 4 or Section 5( d) of this Article VI.




	Section 2. ACTIONS OTHER THAN
	BY THE CORPORATION. This corporation will have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its
	favor) by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if that person acted in good
	faith and in a




	 




	II-21







	Table of Contents




	manner that the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of that person
	was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not, of itself, create a presumption either that the person did not act in good faith and in a
	manner that the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was not unlawful.




	Section 3. ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. This corporation will have the power to indemnify any person who was or is
	a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation,
	against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of that action, if such person acted in good faith, in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and
	its shareholders. No indemnification will be made under this Section 3 for the following:




	(a) Any claim, issue, or
	matter on which such person has been adjudged to be liable to this corporation in the performance of such persons duty to the corporation and its shareholders, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was
	pending will determine on application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses, and then only to the extent that the court will determine;




	(b) Amounts paid m settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval; or




	(c) Expenses incurred in defending a pending action that is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.




	Section 4. SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE BY AGENT. To the extent that an agent of this corporation has been successful on the merits in defense
	of any proceeding referred to in Sections 2 or 3 of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent will be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.




	Section 5. REQUIRED APPROVAL. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Article VI, any indemnification under this
	section will be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, after a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
	Section 2 or 3 by one of the following:






	(a)




	A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding;






	(b) Independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of directors who are not parties to such a proceeding is not available.




	(c) (i) The affirmative vote of a majority of shares of this corporation entitled to vote represented at a duly held
	meeting at which a quorum is present; or




	(ii) the written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled
	to vote (for purposes of this subsection 5(c), the shares owned by the person to be indemnified will not be considered outstanding or entitled to vote thereon); or




	(d) The court in which the proceeding is or was pending, on application made by this corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or
	not such application by the agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by this corporation.




	Section 6. ADVANCE OF
	EXPENSES. Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the corporation before the final disposition of such proceeding on receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of




	 




	II-22

	the agent to repay such amounts if it will be determined ultimately that the agent is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article VI.




	Section 7. OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS. The indemnification provided by this Article VI will not be deemed exclusive of any other
	rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under, e.g., any bylaw, agreement, or vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, both regarding action in an official capacity and regarding action in another capacity while holding
	such office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the articles of the corporation. Nothing in this section will affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than such directors and officers may
	be entitled by contract or otherwise.




	Section 8. LIMITATIONS. No indemnification or advance will be made under this
	Article VI, except as provided in Section 4 or Section 5(d), in any circumstance if it appears:




	(a) That it would
	be inconsistent with a provision of the articles or bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders, or an agreement which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a
	court in approving settlement.




	Section 9. INSURANCE. This corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
	any agent of the corporation insuring against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agents status as such, whether or not this corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent
	against that liability under the provisions of this Article VI. Despite the foregoing, if this corporation owns all or a portion of the shares of the company issuing the policy of insurance, the insuring company or the policy will meet the
	conditions set forth in Corporations Code §317(i).




	Section 10. FIDUCIARIES OF CORPORATE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN. This
	Article VI does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that persons capacity as such, even though that person may also be an agent of the corporation. The
	corporation will have the power, to the extent permitted by Corporations Code §207(f), to indemnify, and to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of any benefit plan for any or all
	of the directors, officers, and employees of the corporation or any of its subsidiary or affiliated corporations.




	Section 11. SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS. The rights provided by this Article VI will continue for a person who has ceased to be an agent and
	will inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.




	Section 12. EFFECT OF AMENDMENT.
	Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this Article VI will not adversely affect an agents right or protection existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, or modification.




	Section 13. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS. The corporation will not be liable to indemnify any agent under this Article VI for (a) any
	amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without the corporations written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, or (b) any judicial award, if the corporation was not given a reasonable and timely
	opportunity to participate, at its expense, in the defense of such action.




	Section 14. SUBROGATION. In the event of
	payment under this Article VI, the corporation will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the rights of recovery of the agent, who will execute all papers required and will do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
	including the execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.




	Section 15. NO DUPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. The corporation will not be liable under this Article VI to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the agent to the extent the agent has
	otherwise

	actually received payment, whether under a policy of insurance, an agreement, or a vote, or through other means, of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable under this Article.






	California Limited Liability Company Subsidiary Guarantors






	The subsidiary guarantors that are California limited liability companies are subject to the provisions of the California Limited Liability Company Act. Under Section 17153 of the California Limited
	Liability Company Act, except for a breach of duty, the articles of organization or written operating agreement of a limited liability company may provide for indemnification of any person, including, without limitation, any manager, member,
	officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company, against judgments, settlements, penalties, fines or expenses of any kind incurred as a result of acting in that capacity. A limited liability company shall have the power to purchase and
	maintain insurance on behalf of any manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company against any liability asserted against on incurred by the person in that capacity or arising out of the persons status as a
	manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company.




	The Operating Agreement of Kennedy Wilson Fund
	Management Group, LLC provides as follows:




	4.5 Indemnification of Member.




	Except as otherwise provided by the Act, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or
	otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company , and the Member shall not be obligated for any such debt, obligation or liability of the Company by reason of being a member of the Company. The Company shall fully
	indemnify the Member for any claim against the Member in the Members capacity as a member or a manager.




	The
	Limited Liability Company Agreement of KW Loan Partners II LLC provides as follows:




	The Company shall indemnify,
	defend, protect and hold harmless each officer from any claim, damage, loss or liability which he or she may suffer which arises from or relates to the performance or nonperformance of the duties assigned to him or her by the Member, as applicable.
	Any individual may hold any number of offices.






	Illinois Corporate Subsidiary Guarantor






	The subsidiary guarantor that is an Illinois corporation is subject to the provisions of the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983, as
	amended (the IBCA). Under Section 8.75 of the IBCA, an Illinois corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
	whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or who is or was serving
	at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
	settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to the best interests of the
	corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.




	In addition, an Illinois corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
	corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
	agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of




	 




	II-24







	Table of Contents




	such action or suit, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, provided that no
	indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person has been adjudged to have been liable to the corporation, unless, and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
	determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper.




	Section 8.75 of the IBCA also provides that, to the extent that a present or former director, officer or employee of a corporation
	has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in either of the foregoing paragraphs, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against
	expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
	corporation.




	The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Kennedy-Wilson Properties, Ltd. are silent with respect to
	indemnification.






	SEC Position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities






	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling
	persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	UNDERTAKINGS







	(A) Each
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being
	made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:



	 





	 




	i.




	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;





	 





	 




	ii.





	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective
	amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the
	total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to
	Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the







	 




	II-26







	Table of Contents






	 




	changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective
	registration statement; and





	 





	 




	iii.




	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such
	information in the registration statement;






	provided, however, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and
	(1)(iii) shall not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrants pursuant to Section 13 or
	Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.




	2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such
	post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and




	3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain
	unsold at the termination of the offering.




	4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the
	Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:



	 





	 




	i.




	Each prospectus filed by the registrants pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus
	was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and





	 





	 




	ii.




	Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an
	offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement
	as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract or sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the
	issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering
	of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document
	incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract or sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any
	statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.






	5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of a registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the
	initial distribution of the securities:




	Each undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of
	securities of such undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the
	following communications, such undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:



	 





	 




	i.





	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of such undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;







	 




	II-27







	Table of Contents






	 




	ii.




	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;





	 





	 




	iii.




	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about such undersigned registrant or its securities provided
	by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant; and





	 





	 




	iv.




	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by such undersigned registrant to the purchaser.






	(B) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
	filing of a registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be
	deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	(C) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
	Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of any registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, each registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by any registrant
	of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of any registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
	being registered, such registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy
	as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




	(D) Each undersigned
	registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act (Act) in accordance with the rules and
	regulations prescribed by the Commission under section 305(b)(2) of the Act.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
