Welcome to Powercat Solutions





























Powercat Products




Powercat Solutions manufactures industrial and commercial cleaning chemicals that are formulated for the most demanding industrial, commercial and abusive environments. We found that most of the other leading cleaning chemicals out there just don’t work and in many cases the cleaning chemicals damage the floor and the cleaning equipment that the cleaning chemicals are run through. Powercat offers a full line of industrial and commercial cleaning products tailored specifically for your application.

About Powercat




 

Powercat Solutions is a new company that has taken over the marketing rights for chemicals created by scrubber manufacturer Factory Cat.   These  chemicals were originally marketed by Factory Cat to its distributors to improve demonstration performance.   Customers who bought Factory Cats were so impressed with the chemical results that Factory Cat began offering them to the general public. 

 

With machinery manufacturing being the primary focus, Factory Cat did not want to remain in the chemical business, so with the help of outside investors, created Powercat.

 

Powercat today markets all of the original Factory Cat formulas, as well as those devised  for its sister commercial division, Tomcat.
