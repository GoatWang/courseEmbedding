Remember, per 10K- PRODUCT LAUNCH 2017   i thought this had already been established as completely false.   once again Cueva, straight from the 10k...   "While we have launched our products in the pre-production stage, we have not begun full production and sales at a commercial level, except for Moto-Meter (which recently completed the pre-production phase and entered the production phase), Wheelies (which has begun limited production), and HailYes (which currently has three licensees)."    i'm sorry, but you are wrong.
