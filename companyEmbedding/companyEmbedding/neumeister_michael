“Wonderfully Drinkable” Gambero Rosso
When Gambero Rosso’s annual wine guide drops, the Italian wine world stops, as winemakers scan the influential Italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes. Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is a perennial Gambero favorite, having earned multiple “Due Bicchieri” (“Two Glasses”) honors in addition to praise as a “sincere, wonderfully drinkable wine.” The Wine Access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more, and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent 2015 vintage by the case. 
The land of Badia di Morrona in the picturesque hills between Florence and Pisa was first worked by 11th century Benedictine monks. Today it is owned by Count Gaslini Alberti, who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past 50 years, outfitting winemaker Corrado Dal Piaz with a refurbished facility, enlarged cellars, and new casks and barrels.
Dal Piaz is notoriously hard on the Badia’s 282 acres of grapes, which soak up the sun on south- and south-eastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone. He tightened spacing in the vines, orchestrating a Darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skin-to-juice ratio. The result is Sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity.
2015’s long growing season allowed temperamental Sangiovese to reach rare, almost perfectly uniform maturity. The vines stretched deep underground, sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil, putting out a dark, crushed-red-fruit Sangiovese, infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins.
If you’re looking for vibrancy in your top-class Chianti, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything quite like this luscious 2015. At $13.99 (and as Gambero Rosso would advise), this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation.








Tasting Notes



WineAccess Travel Log
The 2015 Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is bright ruby to the edge, with a fabulous nose of wild berry, blue flower, and tangy spices. Juicy and high-toned on the attack, with sneaky weight and supple texture. This is textbook Chianti.

                                The 2014 Teeter-Totter Cabernet boasts the fingerprints of a master craftsman. Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Wine Growing Regions




Across the wine world, different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine.
The distinction between Old World wine regions and New World wine regions is particularly important: as a sweeping generalization, Old World regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven, while New World regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in France will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in California will likely produce wines that are more fruit-forward.
But different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes. For example, within France, Bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes, while Burgundy is associated with red wines made from the Pinot Noir grape. Use this page to find top-rated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s wine-making profile.
