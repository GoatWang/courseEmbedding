The ManeGain® Hair Grower™ employs technology that rejuvenates and restores your scalp and hair follicles in order for you to look your youngest. ManeGain is committed to regrowing not only your hair, but restoring your youthful look of vitality, vigor, and energy!


The HALO Hair Rejuvenation Therapy™ is a high-technology based treatment comprised of three non-invasive light energies when delivered simultaneously bathes the scalp with a natural cleansing energy which stimulates the  hair follicle cells, enhances blood flow, and minimizes & reverses the causes of gender pattern hair loss or baldness.  In effect, this Therapy produces the following results:


Stimulates Hair Growth & Regrowth
Decreases Hair Loss
Increases Keratin and Cuticle Production
Grows Stronger, Thicker Hair
The Ability to Grow Longer hair


The ManeGain® Hair Grower technology restores a youthful look of vitality, vigor and energy, without any negative side effects or contraindications. Before we explain how and why our technology has over a 93% success rate in treating Androgenic Alopecia, an understanding of why we loose hair, as well as the shortcomings of drugs and chemicals is important.
Understanding Hair Loss
The main culprit in hair loss is a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone)*, which is produced in both men and women.  In most people that suffer from hair loss, DHT attaches to the cells that creates the hair follicles and signals these cells to stop producing the keratin that makes hair.  DHT also constricts the blood vessels around your hair follicles, which reduces the flow of blood to the hair follicle cells. With less blood flow, the hair follicle cells receive less nourishment; the hair shaft becomes thin, weak, and frail and eventually new hair will cease to be produced.  The follicle cells literally starve from a lack of nourishment.

Why Other Treatments Fail
Although DHT buildup around your hair follicle is destructive, it is a vital hormone for men and women to remain healthy.  Chemicals or drugs such as Rogaine® and Propecia® may lessen the effect of DHT at the hair follicle but are also likely to severely affect DHT levels throughout your body and have other side effects**. Medical studies have documented their numerous negative health effects, including loss of libido and feminizing results for men, and facial growth on women.  Consult all warning labels for a complete list of negative health effects when using any drug or chemical.
What technology is used to solve this problem?
HALO™ is a natural, chemical and drug-free solution that regrows hair.  HALO™ technology consists of three separate technologies that when combined, produce lasting results.  Our technologies are Cool LaserPulse™, SpectraPulse™ and Dyna-Pulse®.  It is the combination of these three technologies that makes HALO™ so effective in combating hair loss and regrowing your hair. Because we are 100% confident in our technology, we back it up by providing the ManeGain Confidence Warranty.

Cool LaserPulse™ is 56 red laser diodes that generate cold coherent light tuned to between 640 and 670 nanometers. The light penetrates the skin on your scalp to a depth of about 4 millimeters, which is where the bottom of the hair follicle is on our scalp.  When the light photons hit the large DHT molecules, the photons give up their energy as a micro current.  This causes DHT to break loose of the receptors on the hair follicle cells, and your body eventually flushes this DHT out of your system.  ManeGain uses FDA approved cool laser diodes.


SpectraPulse™ is four different energy levels or wavelengths of light: red, green, yellow and blue.  Together, they create a micro-electrical stimulation on various proteins within the cells as well as the entire hair follicle cell. This four-color combination of light wave pulses wakes up cells chocked by DHT, invigorates them, and increases their ability to absorb nutrients and flush cellular waste.  We like to refer to SpectraPulse™ as cellular CPR.


Dyna-Pulse® is a pulsed magnetic field therapy, a proven technology for stimulating blood-flow and reducing cellular inflammation.  It is a cellular massage that helps the cells swollen by DHT to restart cellular respiration, which is the ability to process food and remove waste products. As effective respiration resumes, the cells metabolize fresh food and oxygen from the blood and get rid of the free radicals and toxins that clogged them up in the first place. As they shrink back to their normal, healthy size, blood circulation improves and the cells resume producing hair as they did before your hair loss.

ManeGain® Just Works!
When combined, our three technologies work to regrow, restore, rejuvenate,  and invigorate your hair.  We guarantee it!  The ManeGain®  HALO™ regenerates and rejuvenates your hair follicles to regrow natural, robust, abundant and healthy hair. As a result, you look younger and feel healthier. We call this our Whole Hair Health program.  If you would enjoy a more detailed explanation on the ManeGain Effect™ to follow this link:  Whole Hair Health.

ManeGain on PR Newswire
May 12, 2017 

Recently, ManeGain was featured on PR Newswire.  The full article is here and a brief follows below.


AUSTIN, Texas, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — ManeGain, the leader in all-natural hair regrowth and rejuvenation technology, has received qualification for its Regulation A+ stock offering. ManeGain becomes the first company in Austin, Texas and the 4th in the state to offer stock directly to the public through this fund-raising vehicle. This release coincides with ManeGain attending the Texas HealthCare Venture Forum on May 3rd, 2017.
Regulation A+ stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and allows startups the ability to sell a company’s stock directly to both qualified and non-qualified investors.  ManeGain has already done field trials on the efficacy of its HairGrower and the results are impressive: 51 out of 53 people who were experiencing significant hair loss saw major hair growth within 10 to 12 weeks.  This amounts to a 96% efficacy rate, which is slightly higher than the company expected.



It Is About Your Financial Freedom
April 9, 2017 



























































This is a pathway to your
Financial Freedom
















Yes, the American Dream can be yours too! Ever wonder why some people “strike it rich” when others sit on the sideline and played it safe? Regulation A+ (Reg A+) is an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) reviewed and authorized public stock under Title IV of the JOBS Act initiated by President George W. Bush, signed into law by President Obama, and formally implemented by the SEC in the spring of 2015. Unlike the older Reg. D stock that ONLY accredited investors could obtain in a start up and that you see traded on NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Reg A+ stock is intended to be available to the average man. This allows non-qualified investors to enjoy the sometimes outlandish returns on investments that were heretofore only available to accredited investors. So, yes now you can see the 5x, 10x, 50x and 100x returns on your stock purchases instead of the 10% to 20% returns typical of IPO stocks sold to the general public. Yup, you now are playing the “inside” game with much higher gains. So what are you waiting for? Our goal is to see all investors get a healthy gain as we position our company to be a great and attractive candidate in the consumer health, beauty, and personal grooming market. There are no guarantees, except not investing means you will have no chance of seeing a large multiple return on you money.
ManeGain is offering a limited amount of Preferred Series A Stock to the public that has been Registered with the SEC. The Details are:

Offering 1,000,000 shares at $5/share ($5 million)
Minimum purchase of $1,000 (200 shares)
Pre-Money Valuation: $17 million, Post-Money valuation: $22 million
When it is gone, it is gone, we expect to be fully subscribed within 90 days.


















Here’s What You can do:
We know this is a great idea, but may have a few questions:

Billion Dollar Buyout and You Can Be Part of It
April 2, 2017 



























































Did You know that …
Big Firms Buy Small Ones















This is important for two reasons: First, we are creating a network of high end salons which are the single most difficult places to sell high end cosmetics, hair, health and beauty products into. Secondly, people spend money, lots of money, to look young, attractive, and stylish. ManeGain is all about beauty, health, and image. Hair is a sign of vitality and vigor in men, and beauty and femininity in women. Individuals want to look healthy and beautiful and are willing to pay to achieve that look. Our intention is to become attractive as a buyout target. The Dollar Shave Club’s acquisition at $1 billion is a high-water mark for health, personal grooming, and beauty companies that are able to create a new avenue to sell directly to consumers. We are creating another one, and would you not want to be a part of that?

ManeGain On Huffington Post
March 31, 2017 

Recently Huffington Post did an article mentioning ManeGain, Inc. with other companies who are the first to employ Regulation A+ (RegA+) to raise money from outside investors. ManeGain is the first company in Austin, Texas to be successfully qualified for a RegA+ offering. In addition, ManeGain is only the 2nd company in Texas to be included with the original pioneers of 33 Companies now qualified under the SEC rules.
33 RegA+ listed companies are currently open for investments






The RegA+ rules, enacted in 2015, offer small and medium-sized businesses a powerful tool to raise capital: up to $50 million can be raised from both accredited and non-accredited investors, and companies can market their offerings through general solicitation.

The Act’s intent was to make raising capital easier for small- and medium-sized businesses, and it enabled companies to give a pitch and raise capital online. The primary beneficiaries of investment crowdfunding have been small businesses, which make up 90% of employers in the United States and create over 60% of new jobs. Potentially the most impactful JOBS Act provision has been Regulation A+.Complete article here

What makes this exciting is that startups like ours have the ability to sell registered stock directly to the public, bypassing the investment bankers and stock brokerages with Reg A+,” Mr. Fry added. “It also allows us to sell to both qualified non-qualified investors.  This money will allow the company to expand to 60 different locations in 40 different cities within 18 to 24 months.”

ManeGain Regulation A+ Stock Approved by the SEC

ManeGain Regulation A+ Stock Approved by the SEC
ManeGain becomes the first company in Austin Texas to be qualified by the SEC to sell registered Series A Preferred Stock to the General Public 
Austin, TX – March 13, 2017: ManeGain, the leader in all-natural hair regrowth and rejuvenation technology, has received qualification for its Regulation A+ stock offering.  They become the first company in Austin, Texas and the fifth in the state of Texas to offer stock directly to the public through this capital acquisition vehicle.
Regulation A+ stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and allows startups the ability to sell a company’s stock directly to both qualified and non-qualified investors.
“It has been a long hard slog to get this to point,” quotes Barry Thornton, ManeGain’s Chairman and co-founder. “Due to changes in the FDA regulations, it became necessary for ManeGain to go through the costly process of obtaining 510K for our HairGrower and that required the company to raise additional capital. Being a consumer facing company, we had to look to non-traditional means to do so, and Regulation A+ was just the ticket,” Mr. Thornton added.
Jeffrey Fry, ManeGain’s CEO and President adds, “In 2012 the JOBSAct was passed to allow startups the ability to sell registered stock directly to the public, bypassing the investment bankers and stock brokerages.” Mr. Fry continues with, “This in essence is like a “mini-IPO. By bypassing the middlemen usually associated with an initial public offering (IPO), everyday consumers can now potentially enjoy the extraordinary returns that were traditionally reserved for the well-heeled investors, bankers, and venture capitalists.”
The company plans on begin sales if its stock sometime in March 2017. All of ManeGain’s filling documents can be found on the SEC’s Edgar site (www.sec.gov/edgar/). The company is using FundAmerica (www.fundamerica.com) as its transfer agent and will be using them when the stock is purchased to hold money in escrow until it is disbursed.

Do You Want to Make Money Like a Billionaire?
March 9, 2017 


How can you do that you ask? ManeGain has done a Regulation A+ filing that allows the Company to sell Preferred IPO Stock directly to the public thru SEC certified stock. Essentially what this means is that the average Jane and Joe can now enjoy the potential extraordinary gains that were reserved for the likes of Venture Capitalists, Investment Bankers, and very wealthy individuals. So, if you are not interested in reaping the rewards of the “Billionaires Boy’s Club” then STOP reading now, and there is no harm, no foul. But, it you want to enter a world that heretofore was off limits to the common man/woman, and enjoy the gains made by billionaires then by all means continue on….

This service is NOT just about hair loss, but about thinning, weak, brittle and frail hair. Yes, for men (and some women) baldness is a problem: but with ALL people, hair loss, hair thinning, frail and brittle hair comes with age, and PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO SHOW THEIR AGE. Our HALO TherapyTM is an all-natural, non-invasive treatment that essentially makes your scalp believe that it is 15 to 25 years younger using a patent pending rejuvenation and bio-stimulation technology.

This is important for two reasons: First, ManeGain is all about beauty, health, and image. Hair is a sign of vitality and vigor in men, and beauty and femininity in women. In both cases it is about looking healthy and youthful. Secondly, we are creating a network of high-end hair salons that are the single most difficult place to sell premium cosmetics, as well as hair, health and beauty products into. The big losers with our arrival will be dermatologist (hair transplant surgeons) and drug companies (i.e.: Propecia & Rogaine). The Dollar Shave Club’s purchase is a high watermark for health, personal grooming, and beauty companies that can create a new avenue of selling directly to consumers.

Our strategy is pretty simple. We share the risk and share the rewards with the salons.  This essentially creates an environment were we face little resistance in placing our HairGrowersTM in high-end, upscale hair salons and spas. We use the resources already in place to leverage each locales “tribe” of enthusiasts to use and promote our service. In addition, our focus market is women with hair loss, weak and thinning hair, or those who want more volume and lift of their hair. Men with hair loss issues will use it too to regrow their hair, but this will comprise only 20% to 30% of our revenue generation.

Regulation A+ (Reg A+) is an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) reviewed and authorized public stock under Title IV of the JOBS Act initiated by George Bush, signed into law by President Obama, and formally implemented by the SEC in the spring of 2015. Unlike the older Reg.

This allows non-qualified investors to enjoy the sometimes outlandish returns on investments that were heretofore only available to accredited investors. So, yes now you can see the 5x, 10x, 50x and even 100x returns on your stock purchases instead of the 10% to 20% gains typical of IPO stocks sold to the general public. Yup, you now are playing the “inside” game.

Yes, this might sound like a miracle cure, but it is NOT! It is just science being applied in a slightly different way to get almost miraculous results. Twenty years from now it will become common practice to use this technology to regrow hair, but right now you have a chance to benefit from that gulf in reality and get on the bandwagon before everyone else does.
If you want to find out more about the technology or details about the Regulation A+ filing, please visit manegain.com. Details of how to purchase our Series A Preferred Stock Offering through FundAmerica can be found here. We will be selling shares at $5/share with a minimum order of 200 shares ($1,000).

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
