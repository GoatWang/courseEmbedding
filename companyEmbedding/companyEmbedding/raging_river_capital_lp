Taseko Mines shareholder proxy battle heats up
Allegations of insider trading met with threats of defamation suit and legal action in U.S.

              

              
                By Nelson Bennett

              March 8, 2016, midnight
            





Despite moving a proposed tailings pond to avoid impacts on Fish Lake, Taseko's New Prosperity mine project was rejected by the federal government. | BIV archives 

















The Vancouver mining company that’s suing the federal government for rejecting the New Prosperity copper mine and tried unsuccessfully to sue the Wilderness Committee for defamation is now fighting another legal battle in the U.S. 
Taseko Mines Ltd. (TSX:TKO; NYSE MKT: TGB) is embroiled in a nasty proxy battle with a dissident shareholder group that wants to elect four of its own members to Taseko’s board of directors, ostensibly to conduct a housecleaning.
In January, a group of shareholders collectively known as Raging River Capital LP acquired 5% of Taseko’s common shares and demanded a shareholder vote. 
On February 26, Taseko filed a complaint in U.S. district court, alleging violations of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations by Raging River.
Taseko claims Raging River failed to disclose that, in addition to its 5% equity stake in Taseko, it owns $22 million in bond debt.
That’s important, said Taseko investor relations vice-president Brian Bergot, because Raging River directors could vote to sell Taseko assets to improve the value of their own bonds, while negatively affecting the share price.
“Any reduction in our corporate debt improves the value of our bonds,” Bergot said.
“As a bond holder, and with [seats on the board], this parternship – Raging River nominees – could take certain action to liquidate Taseko assets, which they stated they would do, and that could have very bad consequences for shareholders.” 

Raging River, meanwhile, has sent a letter to the BC Securities Commission seeking an investigation into what it alleges is insider trading on the part of two Taseko executives.
Taseko responded to those allegations March 1 with a lawyer’s letter to Raging River managing partner Mark Radzik demanding a retraction and apology and threatening a defamation suit.
Radzik shrugs off the threat, saying it’s just a distraction from legitimate concerns shareholders have about the company’s performance, which includes a 90% loss in market cap since the beginning of 2011.
“They get mad, they lose, they sue everyone,” he told Business in Vancouver. “That’s what they do.”
In  its letter to Radzik, Taseko denies Raging River’s allegation that Taseko CEO Russell Hallbauer and company vice-president of corporate affairs Brian Battison had bought Taseko stock between January 15 and January 25 “while in possession of non-public, material information.” 

The information in question was a $70 million credit facility with an affiliate of RK Mine Finance (Red Kite) that Taseko announced on February 1. 
In its letter to Radzik, Taseko disputes the claim that Hallbauer and Battison knew that the deal would be done.
“In particular the shares were acquired by our clients well before the credit agreement with Red Kite was entered into and at a time when it was not known whether the transaction would proceed or not,” the letter states.
Among its other complaints, Raging River questions the “conflicted” relationship between Taseko and Hunter Dickinson Inc. (HDI), a private mining house whose board of directors includes Hallbauer and two other Taseko directors.
According to Raging River, Hunter Dickinson has received $25.8 million from Taseko in fees and investments since 2012. 
"Raging River is focusing on a relationship which we have with Hunter Dickinson which is a very beneficial relationship to Taseko," Bergot said. "They provide cost effective services from high-quality individuals, professionals. They are trying to make something out of conflict which does not exist."
Raging River also questions Taseko’s friendly acquisition in 2014 of exploration company Curis Resources Ltd. Hallbauer and two other directors were Curis shareholders, holding 8% of the company’s stock, according to Taseko.
Radzik said it was a bad deal for shareholders. 

“That’s a deal they paid almost $100 million for and the company was almost bankrupt,” he said.
Curis had three directors in common with Taseko. 
“They were completely recused from the entire process," Bergot said. "So they had no say.”
He said an independent committee was struck to evaluate the friendly acquisition.
Mickey Fulp, publisher of the Mercenary Geologist, was a Curis shareholder and through the transaction became a Taseko shareholder. He doesn’t share Raging River’s view that there is an inherent conflict of interest between Taseko and HDI. 
Fulp has criticized such arrangements in the past with junior mining companies. He has, for example, questioned the practice of CEOs of junior exploration companies hiring their own drilling companies. 
But Fulp said HDI and Taseko are both “real companies,” and he doesn’t have a problem with the arrangement. 
“That said, they [HDI] have a reputation of being a high-cost outfit,” Fulp added.
In a press-release response to some of Raging River’s questions about its relationship with HDI, the company said it conducts regular reviews of the mining services HDI provides and compares its rates with those of other companies.
“Taseko is satisfied the rates are competitive with, if not lower than, other suppliers of similar services,” it said.
As a shareholder, Fulp’s biggest beef with Taseko was its acquisition of Curis.
“I was not happy with the terms of that takeover,” Fulp said.
Radzik said there are a lot of shareholders who are unhappy and that they want to see a change in Taseko’s direction and governance.
He characterizes Taseko management and directors as being overly litigious and confrontational, citing the New Prosperity project as an example.
The Tsilhqot’in First Nation vigorously opposed the project over concerns that the area’s Fish Lake would be drained in order to build a tailings pond.
Two iterations of the mine project were rejected by the federal government.
Taseko responded by filing for judicial review. It later asked the Federal Court to convert that application to a lawsuit against the federal government. The court rejected the second application to convert to a lawsuit but allowed the judicial review to proceed.
Just last week, Taseko filed suit against the Attorney General of Canada and Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency over their rejection of the New Prosperity mine project.
Taseko also tried to sue the Wilderness Committee for defamation over public criticisms it made about the New Prosperity project.
In January, the BC Supreme Court dismissed the defamation suit against the Wilderness Committee and awarded the environmental organization court costs.
Taseko responded by filing an appeal of the court’s dismissal of the defamation suit.
Should Raging River succeed in replacing some of Taseko’s directors with its own designates, Radzik said he would hope to see a different approach. 
 He thinks the only way the New Prosperity project could go forward is if the company changes its attitude towards the Tsilhqot’in. 
“The first thing we would do is try to re-engage the First Nation and rebuild trust and try to start over again,” he said.
To address concerns about HDI, Taseko said it will add two new independent directors to the board and will change governance policies to give shareholders greater say on the relationship with HDI.
A Taseko shareholder meeting has been scheduled for May 10. 
But between now and then, the war of words between Raging River and Taseko appears unlikely to abate. Taseko has told shareholders via a press release that Raging River may have misled them when it failed to disclose that Radzik had, at one time, been a director for an American company that had gone bankrupt.
In a press release naming four nominees for director positions, including Radzik, Raging River stated that “to the knowledge of Raging River,” none of the four nominees were a director or chief executive or financial officer for a company that had been subject to cease trade orders or bankruptcy proceedings.
Taseko points out in a February 25, 2016 press release that Radzik had been a director for a U.S. company, Support Plus Medical, which went bankrupt in 2013.
“The bankruptcy involves troubling circumstances that illustrate the danger of corporate directors who are also lenders,” Taseko said in its press release.

Raging River Capital LP to Taseko Mines Limited: Shareholders Won't Be Intimidated

/EINPresswire.com/ -- VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 02/25/16 --  


--  To stop Taseko Mines' baseless mud-slinging and attempts to distract
    from shareholder concerns at the Company, Raging River is commencing a
    defamation lawsuit.
--  Sudden resignation of director George Ireland underscores serious
    shareholder concerns about what exactly is going on at the board level.



Raging River Capital LP ("Raging River"), owning approximately 5.1% of the outstanding common shares of Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO)(NYSE MKT: TGB) ("Taseko"), has said enough is enough in response to Taseko's continued attempts to distract from the problems of the Company and is commencing a defamation lawsuit with the objective of elevating the tenor of the debate to focus on the real issues of Taseko.


By trying to portray Mark Radzik, Managing Partner of Raging River, in a negative and baseless fashion, Taseko is continuing its well established strategy of finger-pointing and mud-slinging. It is clear this is yet another attempt to avoid scrutiny on very clear conflicts of interest and destruction of shareholder value, most recently shown through a lawsuit against the Canadian Government and a losing suit against the Wilderness Committee.



"I expect Taseko will eventually and desperately use the fact I once lost money on a lemonade stand venture when I was six as an excuse for why their conflicted and self-interested directors should not be replaced," said Mr. Radzik. "No amount of mud-slinging will change our view that the Hunter Dickinson related directors have gotten rich at the expense of Taseko shareholders and no amount of attempted distraction can erase their value destruction. Today we say enough is enough. We won't be bullied and we won't back down. We are fighting back to ensure we can bring the change to Taseko that shareholders want."


Shareholders haven't been fooled by Taseko's 'campaign of mass distraction' as Raging River has received overwhelming expressions of support from Taskeo shareholders, including Vertex One owning 3.92% of issued and outstanding shares, endorsing the replacement of incumbent directors Ronald Thiessen, Russell Hallbauer and Robert Dickinson with Raging River's independent nominees Paul Blythe, Randy Davenport, Henry Park and Mark Radzik.


Raging River asks shareholders to consider the facts related to certain directors affiliated with Hunter Dickinson:


Hunter Dickinson affiliated directors have a disproportionate say in Taseko decisions. Hunter Dickinson is a privately owned mining group with significant influence on Taseko. Hunter Dickinson executives hold three board positions at Taseko, including the Chairman, Ronald W. Thiessen, and the CEO, Russell Hallbauer, and yet, these directors own just 2.6% of Taseko.


Hunter Dickinson related entities have received $25.8 million from Taseko. Since 2012, total fees and investment paid to Hunter Dickinson related entities totals $25.8 million. In addition, Hunter Dickinson related entities have received from Curis Resources Ltd. ("Curis") unusually high management and service fees of US$5.4 million over the 2013 and 2014 Curis fiscal years during which time Taseko invested $7 million in Curis. This means more than half of the money Taseko invested in Curis has been paid back to Hunter Dickinson related entities in fees.


Taseko bought Hunter Dickinson related company Curis while on the verge of bankruptcy. Hunter Dickinson and related parties owned 11% of Curis. Curis was on the verge of bankruptcy with only $690K of cash and $27 million of expensive (11%) debt due in 2016, despite injecting $5 million in the first quarter. Taseko acquired Curis in November 2014 at a premium (21% above the 20-day VWAP) for a company about to go bankrupt and ensured the acquisition price was just below the threshold that would require shareholder approval. Not everyone has access to a company like Taseko to bail out a company going bankrupt like Curis.


ADVISORS


Raging River has engaged Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP as its legal advisor and Kingsdale Shareholder Services as its strategic and communications advisor and proxy solicitor.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION


The information contained in this press release does not and is not meant to constitute a solicitation of a proxy within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Although the requisitioned general meeting of shareholders has been scheduled to take place on May 10, 2016 (the "Meeting"), shareholders are not being asked at this time to execute a proxy in favour of Raging River's director nominees (the "Concerned Shareholder Nominees") or any other resolution set forth in the requisition. In connection with the Meeting, Raging River intends to file a dissident information circular (the "Information Circular") in due course in compliance with applicable securities laws.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, Raging River is voluntarily providing the disclosure required under section 9.2(4) of National Instrument 51-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations in accordance with securities laws applicable to public broadcast solicitations.

All costs incurred for any solicitation will be borne by Raging River, provided that, subject to applicable law, Raging River may seek reimbursement from Taseko of Raging River's out-of-pocket expenses, including proxy solicitation expenses and legal fees, incurred in connection with a successful reconstitution of the Board.


Raging River is not soliciting proxies in connection with the Meeting at this time, and shareholders are not being asked at this time to execute proxies in favour of the Concerned Shareholder Nominees (in respect of the Meeting) or any other resolution set forth in the requisition. Any proxies solicited by Raging River will be solicited pursuant to the Information Circular sent to shareholders of Taseko after which solicitations may be made by or on behalf of Raging River, by mail, telephone, fax, email or other electronic means, and in person by directors, officers and employees of Raging River or any proxy advisor that Raging River may retain or by the Concerned Shareholder Nominees.


Any proxies solicited by Raging River in connection with the Meeting may be revoked by instrument in writing by the shareholder giving the proxy or by its duly authorized officer or attorney, or in any other manner permitted by law and the articles of Taseko. None of Raging River or, to its knowledge, any of its associates or affiliates, has any material interest, direct or indirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter proposed to be acted on at the Meeting, other than the election of directors to the Board.


Additional information concerning the Concerned Shareholder Nominees is contained in the press release of Raging River dated January 13, 2016.


Taseko's principal business office is 15th floor - 1040 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6E 4H1.

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 01/13/16 -- 


--  Taseko's directors affiliated with Hunter Dickinson Inc. are conflicted
    and we believe have led Taseko into multiple related-party transactions
    with no proven upside to shareholder value 

--  Taseko has underperformed relative to its peers over the short, medium,
    and long term 

--  Shareholders lack confidence in members of the Board and trading is at a
    discount to Taseko peers 

--  Raging River's Nominees are highly qualified, have a track record of
    value creation and will refocus the company on its core assets to
    increase shareholder value and align directors' interests with all
    shareholders 


Raging River Capital LP ("Raging River"), owning approximately 5.1 % of the outstanding common shares of Taseko Mines Limited ("Taseko"), announced today it has requisitioned the Taseko Board of Directors to call a meeting of shareholders for the purposes of, among other things, reconstituting the Board with the removal of three incumbent directors and the election of four new independent directors. The new independent directors nominees would constitute a minority of the Board. 

"We believe Taseko has underperformed relative to its peers and that certain members of the incumbent board are conflicted. The three directors that should be removed stand to benefit from the collection of significant fees and the use of Taseko's valuable cash reserves for their own personal interest. We believe making preferential, related party deals in a difficult macro cycle further destroys shareholder value," said Mark Radzik, Managing Partner of Raging River. "Taseko shareholders deserve better. It's time for a Taseko shareholders can trust. The leaders of this company need to focus on operating its core business, and reestablishing credibility with its investors and improving share performance. Our independent and highly qualified director nominees will bring about positive change to create value for all shareholders." 

THE CASE FOR CHANGE

It is clear to Raging River that the interests of certain members of the current board are not aligned with those of Taseko shareholders, given their relationship with Hunter Dickinson Inc. ("Hunter Dickinson"), a privately owned mining group with significant influence on Taseko. Hunter Dickinson has earned generous management and service fees from Taseko, which add up to almost $4 million per year, and yet Hunter Dickinson owns less than 3% of the company. Hunter Dickinson executives hold three board positions at Taseko, including the Chairman, Ronald W. Thiessen, and the CEO, Russell Hallbauer, and yet, Hunter Dickinson owns less than 3% of the company. 

RAGING RIVER'S PLAN FOR CHANGE

Raging River believes Taseko has excellent core assets, the potential of which can be unlocked with the right leadership and the right plan for change: 


1.  Align the entire Board's interests with those of Taseko shareholders,
    including performing a strategic review, assessing management
    compensation, and evaluating the relationship between Taseko and Hunter
    Dickinson going forward. 
2.  Increase shareholder value by working together with Taseko stakeholders
    to evaluate opportunities to reduce liabilities, divest non-core assets
    and move projects forward. 
3.  Focus on managing Taseko's balance sheet debt and positioning the
    company to take advantage of the rebound in copper prices. 


RAGING RIVER'S INDEPENDENT AND EXPERIENCED BOARD NOMINEES

We believe that it is time for new independent leadership on the Board. The Requisition proposes the removal of each of Ronald Thiessen, Russell Hallbauer and Robert Dickinson as directors of Taseko, the setting of the number of directors at nine and the election the following four (4) new directors to the Board (collectively, the "Concerned Shareholder Nominees"): 


--  Paul Blythe - Mr. Blythe founded QuadraFNX predecessor, Quadra in 2003,
    and had been the CEO until the sale to KGHM in 2012 for US$3 Billion.
    Prior to that, he was the head of Business Development at BHP Billiton
    copper division. He gained operations experience from his involvement in
    numerous mining projects including Mount Pleasant, Hemlo, Dome and
    Gibraltar, as well as project development experience through Lomas
    Bayas, Carlota and Sierra Gorda. 
--  Randy Davenport - Mr. Davenport was most recently the President of CST
    Marcobre in Peru which sold to Minsur for $500MM. Prior to joining
    Marcobre, Mr. Davenport held numerous roles with Phelps Dodge/Freeport,
    lastly as Vice President of Resource Development. As the President of
    Cerro Verde, Mr. Davenport led the feasibility studies, permitting and
    obtaining approval for the expansion that tripled copper production. He
    has extensive experience in managing feasibility studies, due
    diligences, project evaluation, strategic development, construction and
    operations. 
--  Henry Park - Mr. Park was most recently a partner at Vulcan Mining, a
    mining private equity investment platform of Soros Fund Management.
    Prior to that, he was the commodity analyst at Soros Fund Management
    where he focused on commodity investing in public and private equities
    and futures. Between Vulcan Mining and Soros Fund management, Mr. Park
    was a managing director and commodity strategist at Electrum Group. 
--  Mark Radzik - Mr. Radzik is Managing Partner and co-founder of Granite
    Creek Partners, LLC, an investment firm that makes opportunistic debt
    and equity investments. Prior to that, Mr. Radzik was a Managing
    Director of Equity Group Investments, a Sam Zell company, where he
    sourced, structured, managed and invested in buyouts, growth equity and
    distressed situations. Mr. Radzik has served on several private and
    public company boards. 


If elected, each of the Nominees would serve until the next annual general meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected or appointed. 

ADVISORS





Raging River has engaged Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP as its legal advisor and Kingsdale Shareholder Services as its strategic advisor and proxy solicitor.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jan. 19, 2016) - --  Raging River welcomes shareholder support for its director nominees and    plan for change --  Since 2012, total fees and investment paid to Hunter Dickinson related    entities totals $25.8 million --  After a pattern of conflicts of interest, Raging River urges Board to    make decisions with the best interests of the Company and all    shareholders in mind  --  Highlights necessity to hold requisitioned meeting on an expedited basis    so newly constituted Board can implement plans to increase shareholder    value and reduce liabilities Raging River Capital LP ("Raging River"), owning approximately 5.1 % of the outstanding common shares of Taseko Mines Limited (TSX:TKO) (NYSE MKT: TGB) ("Taseko"), thanks those shareholders who have reached out to express support for Raging River's director nominees and urges the incumbent Board to act responsibly in the period before the requisitioned meeting (the "Meeting").  Raging River announced last week that it had requisitioned the Taseko Board of Directors to call a meeting of shareholders for the purposes of, among other things, reconstituting the board with the removal of three incumbent directors and the election of four new independent directors. "The early indications of support we have received from shareholders who have contacted us underscores the need for change on an expedited basis. The longer the current Taseko Board goes without addressing the ongoing conflicts of interest, the more shareholder value is at risk of being destroyed. On behalf of all shareholders, we urge the Board to call and hold the requisitioned meeting promptly," said Mark Radzik, Managing Partner of Raging River. "We also remind the Board of their fiduciary duty and obligation to act in the best interests of the company and all shareholders. It is time for a Taseko Board that shareholders trust and the market has confidence in." Raging River asks shareholders to consider the facts related to certain directors affiliated with Hunter Dickinson Inc. ("Hunter Dickinson" or "HDI"): Hunter Dickinson affiliated directors have a disproportionate say in Taseko decisions. Hunter Dickinson is a privately owned mining group with significant influence on Taseko. Hunter Dickinson executives hold three board positions at Taseko, including the Chairman, Ronald W. Thiessen, and the CEO, Russell Hallbauer, and yet, these directors own just 2.6% of Taseko.Hunter Dickinson related entities have received $25.8 million from Taseko.  Since 2012, total fees and investment paid to Hunter Dickinson related entities totals $25.8 million. In addition, Hunter Dickinson related entities have received from Curis Resources Ltd. ("Curis") unusually high management and service fees of US$5.4 million over the 2013 and 2014 Curis fiscal years during which time Taseko invested $7 million in Curis. This means more than half of the money Taseko invested in Curis has been paid back to Hunter Dickinson related entities in fees. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Fees paid by Taseko to HDI related                                          entities                                  2012      2013      2014     Total----------------------------------------------------------------------------G&A                                     $1.9MM    $2.5MM    $2.7MM    $7.1MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Exploration and evaluation expenses     $0.5MM    $1.1MM    $0.6MM    $2.2MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Total Fees                              $2.4MM    $3.6MM    $3.3MM    $9.3MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Investment by Taseko in entities                                            with Common Directors of Taseko                                             ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Private company                         $7.1MM    $2.4MM              $9.5MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Curis(1)                                          $2.0MM    $5.0MM    $7.0MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Total Investments                       $7.1MM    $4.4MM    $5.0MM   $16.5MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Total Fees and Investments(CAD$)        $9.5MM    $8.0MM    $8.3MM   $25.8MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------Fees paid by Curis to HDI related                                           entities (US$)(2)                       $3.1MM    $3.4MM    $2.0MM    $8.5MM----------------------------------------------------------------------------1.  Fees paid to Curis before the Taseko acquisition of Curis 2.  Fees paid by Curis before the Taseko acquisition of Curis Given what Raging River believes to be the sustained pattern of questionable self-dealings, it is crucial that the meeting takes place as soon as possible so that trust can be restored to Taseko's Board and Raging River's nominees can begin implementing a plan to reduce liabilities, ensure the responsible use of shareholder dollars at the Board level, and improve Taseko's balance sheet to optimally position the Company to take advantage of a rebound in copper prices. RAGING RIVER'S PLAN FOR CHANGE Raging River believes Taseko has excellent core assets, the potential of which can be unlocked with the right leadership and the right plan for change: 1.  Align the entire Board's interests with those of Taseko shareholders,    including performing a strategic review, and evaluating the relationship    between Taseko and Hunter Dickinson going forward. 2.  Increase shareholder value by working together with Taseko stakeholders    to evaluate opportunities to reduce liabilities, divest non-core assets    and move projects forward. 3.  Focus on managing Taseko's balance sheet debt and positioning the    Company to take advantage of the rebound in copper prices. 4.  Focus on the Gibraltar Mine and ability to remain solvent. 5.  Reduce overhead and stop investments in the pursuit of high-risk    projects. 6.  Focus on the Prosperity Mine, utilizing core skills, as a credible    development project. RAGING RIVER'S INDEPENDENT AND EXPERIENCED BOARD NOMINEES We believe that it is time for new independent leadership on the Board. The Requisition proposes the removal of each of Ronald Thiessen, Russell Hallbauer and Robert Dickinson as directors of Taseko, the setting of the number of directors at nine and the election the following four (4) new directors to the Board: --  Paul Blythe - Mr. Blythe founded QuadraFNX predecessor, Quadra in 2003,    and had been the CEO until the sale to KGHM in 2012 for US$3 billion.    Prior to that, he was the head of Business Development at BHP Billiton    copper division. He gained operations experience from his involvement in    numerous mining projects including Mount Pleasant, Hemlo, Dome and    Gibraltar, as well as project development experience through Lomas    Bayas, Carlota and Sierra Gorda. --  Randy Davenport - Mr. Davenport was most recently the President of CST    Marcobre in Peru which sold to Minsur for $500 million. Prior to joining    Marcobre, Mr. Davenport held numerous roles with Phelps Dodge/Freeport,    lastly as Vice President of Resource Development. As the President of    Cerro Verde, Mr. Davenport led the feasibility studies, permitting and    obtaining approval for the expansion that tripled copper production. He    has extensive experience in managing feasibility studies, due    diligences, project evaluation, strategic development, construction and    operations. --  Henry Park - Mr. Park was most recently a partner at Vulcan Mining, a    mining private equity investment platform of Soros Fund Management.    Prior to that, he was the commodity analyst at Soros Fund Management    where he focused on commodity investing in public and private equities    and futures. Between Vulcan Mining and Soros Fund management, Mr. Park    was a managing director and commodity strategist at Electrum Group. --  Mark Radzik - Mr. Radzik is Managing Partner and co-founder of Granite    Creek Partners, LLC, an investment firm that makes opportunistic debt    and equity investments. Prior to that, Mr. Radzik was a Managing    Director of Equity Group Investments, a Sam Zell company, where he    sourced, structured, managed and invested in buyouts, growth equity and    distressed situations. Mr. Radzik has served on several private and    public company boards. If elected, each of the Concerned Shareholder Nominees would serve until the next annual general meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected or appointed. ADVISORS Raging River has engaged Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP as its legal advisor and Kingsdale Shareholder Services as its strategic and communications advisor and proxy solicitor.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The information contained in this press release does not and is not meant to constitute a solicitation of a proxy within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Raging River also reveals the inadequate response Taseko Mines has taken in ending these conflicts of interest and warns shareholders not to be fooled by the smokescreens they are putting in place to protect their golden goose.While the full text of the letter can be viewed here, at www.atrustedtaseko.com, or at Taseko Mines' SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com, new revelations include:Conflicted acquisition of Curis Resources Ltd. without requisite shareholder approval. Evidence of a significant overlap of Taseko Mines' directors and officers with those of Hunter Dickinson and the company they were acquiring for over $100 million, Curis Resources Ltd., such that the "independent" committee struck to assess the transaction was not so independent, and Raging River believes that the transaction ran afoul of applicable laws designed to protect shareholders in related party transactions. Exposure of another "buddy bailout" of Misty Mountain Gold Ltd., that once again included numerous Hunter Dickinson representatives on its board.  Taseko purchased the Harmony Project from Misty Mountain in October 2001 for an estimated $65 million. What happened to this project? In Taseko Mines' own words, it "was written down to a nominal value in 2004" as "there had not been significant exploration or development conducted". In under three years, the value of the project went from $65 million to zero.Revelation of a high compensation risk. The leading independent proxy advisor and industry standard bearer, Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), has assessed Taseko Mines' compensation program and found it to be so deficient that it ranked in the bottom 10% of index or region peers whose compensation program ISS has assessed. What Taseko Mines doesn't want you to know is that they have been determined to have a "high compensation risk". In fact, on the risk scale they reached a 9 out of 10! This means the way and amount they pay Hallbauer and the rest of management is wholly divorced from good corporate governance and at extreme odds with the interests of shareholders. Why hasn't the board done anything to address this? Cronyism. Systemic cronyism. The poor leadership and Hunter Dickinson influence at Taseko Mines is augmented by what Raging River believes to be the cronyism which influences the selection of its "independent" directors. Three of the four so-called current "independent" directors have had significant relationships with the conflicted directors prior to joining the board. Not only are these "independent" board members close to Hunter Dickinson, they have been paid handsomely in retirement, on average almost $250,000 per year. With a 'buddies board', who is looking out for shareholders? Previous insolvency involving Taseko Mines' Chairman Ronald Thiessen. Thiessen was the Chairman of the board of Great Basin Gold Ltd. when it filed under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. Raging River believes raising the issue of insolvency in respect of others is a desperate and failed attempt to distract shareholders from Thiessen's own history of insolvency. Numerous questions surround the role he played in this insolvency. Pattern of value destruction. For decades, Thiessen, Hallbauer and Dickinson have left a trail of value destruction behind them. Each has a track record of negative total shareholder return, as shown below:      Annualized Total Shareholder Return (TSR)   Robert Dickinson Average TSR    Executive -21.47%    Director -14.49%   Ronald Thiessen Average TSR    Executive -9.87%    Director -9.02%   Russell Hallbauer Average TSR    Executive -5.01%    Director -19.96%  Average TSR: Calculated as an average of the annualized total shareholder returns achieved over each director's respective tenure as a public company executive or director, as sourced from Bloomberg on March 31, 2016 and assuming dividend reinvestment.Raging River also announces it will be holding a telephone town hall and webcast where it will provide full details about its plan to create long-term value for all stakeholders and give shareholders a chance to ask the director nominees questions directly.

The new independent directors nominees would constitute a minority of the Board."We believe Taseko has underperformed relative to its peers and that certain members of the incumbent board are conflicted. The three directors that should be removed stand to benefit from the collection of significant fees and the use of Taseko's valuable cash reserves for their own personal interest. We believe making preferential, related party deals in a difficult macro cycle further destroys shareholder value," said Mark Radzik, Managing Partner of Raging River. "Taseko shareholders deserve better. It's time for a Taseko shareholders can trust. The leaders of this company need to focus on operating its core business, and reestablishing credibility with its investors and improving share performance. Our independent and highly qualified director nominees will bring about positive change to create value for all shareholders."THE CASE FOR CHANGEIt is clear to Raging River that the interests of certain members of the current board are not aligned with those of Taseko shareholders, given their relationship with Hunter Dickinson Inc. ("Hunter Dickinson"), a privately owned mining group with significant influence on Taseko. Hunter Dickinson has earned generous management and service fees from Taseko, which add up to almost $4 million per year, and yet Hunter Dickinson owns less than 3% of the company. Hunter Dickinson executives hold three board positions at Taseko, including the Chairman, Ronald W. Thiessen, and the CEO, Russell Hallbauer, and yet, Hunter Dickinson owns less than 3% of the company.RAGING RIVER'S PLAN FOR CHANGERaging River believes Taseko has excellent core assets, the potential of which can be unlocked with the right leadership and the right plan for change:Align the entire Board's interests with those of Taseko shareholders, including performing a strategic review, assessing management compensation, and evaluating the relationship between Taseko and Hunter Dickinson going forward. Increase shareholder value by working together with Taseko stakeholders to evaluate opportunities to reduce liabilities, divest non-core assets and move projects forward. Focus on managing Taseko's balance sheet debt and positioning the company to take advantage of the rebound in copper prices. RAGING RIVER'S INDEPENDENT AND EXPERIENCED BOARD NOMINEESWe believe that it is time for new independent leadership on the Board. The Requisition proposes the removal of each of Ronald Thiessen, Russell Hallbauer and Robert Dickinson as directors of Taseko, the setting of the number of directors at nine and the election the following four (4) new directors to the Board (collectively, the "Concerned Shareholder Nominees"):Paul Blythe - Mr. Blythe founded QuadraFNX predecessor, Quadra in 2003, and had been the CEO until the sale to KGHM in 2012 for US$3 Billion. Prior to that, he was the head of Business Development at BHP Billiton copper division. He gained operations experience from his involvement in numerous mining projects including Mount Pleasant, Hemlo, Dome and Gibraltar, as well as project development experience through Lomas Bayas, Carlota and Sierra Gorda. Randy Davenport - Mr. Davenport was most recently the President of CST Marcobre in Peru which sold to Minsur for $500MM. Prior to joining Marcobre, Mr. Davenport held numerous roles with Phelps Dodge/Freeport, lastly as Vice President of Resource Development. As the President of Cerro Verde, Mr. Davenport led the feasibility studies, permitting and obtaining approval for the expansion that tripled copper production. He has extensive experience in managing feasibility studies, due diligences, project evaluation, strategic development, construction and operations. Henry Park - Mr. Park was most recently a partner at Vulcan Mining, a mining private equity investment platform of Soros Fund Management. Prior to that, he was the commodity analyst at Soros Fund Management where he focused on commodity investing in public and private equities and futures. Between Vulcan Mining and Soros Fund management, Mr. Park was a managing director and commodity strategist at Electrum Group. Mark Radzik - Mr. Radzik is Managing Partner and co-founder of Granite Creek Partners, LLC, an investment firm that makes opportunistic debt and equity investments.
