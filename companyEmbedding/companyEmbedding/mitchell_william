Mitchell Natural Health Products and Books Dr. William Mitchell













 site design by TWD 



  Welcome to Natural Health

Natural Health is Dr. William  Mitchell’s family company, designed to offer you access to his powerful Fruit  Anthocyanins blend and to his Natural Medicine books.  Dr. Mitchell’s  mission was to promote Naturopathic Medicine today and for future generations, and it is our goal to  keep his important work available to physicians and their patients.

          A pioneer in the use of  concentrated dark fruits and berries as powerful tools in promoting health, Dr.  Mitchell used these concentrates for thousands of patients. Over the years he  modified his blend to achieve optimal clinical health benefits, and our Fruit  Anthocyanins product made available here contains his final formulation.
Dr. Mitchell authored three books on Naturopathic  therapies and botanical medicines.  These texts are excellent tools for  use in clinical practice based on decades of experience from both Dr. John  Bastyr and Dr. Mitchell.  At the time of his death he was working on  contributions to The Foundations book of Naturopathic Medicine, and his own compilation  of clinical cases, both of which will be available in the future.

Overview

William Mitchell Ramsay is perhaps one of the most fascinating biblical scholars from the turn of the twentieth century, and his writings are full of knowledge and insight that can only come from one who has extensively experienced firsthand the archaeology and people of Asia Minor. For decades, Ramsay immersed himself in the culture of what is now Greece and Turkey, as he set out first to disprove the Bible as factual and then, to his amazement, to show how the New Testament has proved itself to be historically infallible based on his findings.
A fantastic companion collection to New Testament study, these books give geographic and historical context to the Bible, confirming the history and events contained in the Scriptures. Particularly concentrated on the gospel of Luke and the journeys of Paul.


With Logos each volume in the collection is fully integrated with the other resources in your library, including Bibles, maps, dictionaries, and other Bible study tools. All Scripture references are linked directly to your preferred translation, making your Bible study and teaching preparations more effective and rewarding. Explore Scripture on a deeper level with search features, passage guides, and the other interactive features in your library. The Logos editions of these important books are more useful than ever for pastors, teachers, leaders, and anyone who wants to get deeper into the truth of God’s Word.


Key Features


Contains over 6,000 pages of biblical and cultural insight into New Testament geography
Offers studies on the credibility of the Bible, based on archaeological evidence
Presents an anthology of essays culled from leading academic and religious journals of the day
Provides historical documentation of William Mitchell Ramsay’s journeys in Asia Minor
Includes commentaries on the epistles to the Corinthians and the Pastoral Epistles

The Church in the Roman Empire Before A.D. 170

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1893
Pages: 494

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The apostle Paul’s journeys were of great significance to William Mitchell Ramsay. Initially, their importance was due to his own personal mission: to disprove Christianity through archaeological evidence. However, as Ramsay studied Acts, traveling to Asia Minor himself to chart Paul’s journey and dispel the truth of the gospel, he was astonished to find that the historical content in the book of Acts is indeed factual, and it was through these studies and travels that Ramsay himself found Christ. The contents of this volume, originally presented as a lecture series in 1892 at Mansfield College, Oxford, give us a look Paul’s travels and the early history of the church through the eyes of an archaeologist. Maps, pictures, and notes are included.







The Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1904
Pages: 443

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Letters and traveling go together, more often than not. Ramsay pairs the two subjects in this volume, showing the correspondences of the early church, relating them to the history and growth of Christianity, and specifically focusing on the letters to the seven churches of Asia: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.







Impressions of Turkey During Twelve Years’ Wanderings

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1897
Pages: 317

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




During the latter part of the nineteenth century, Ramsay saturated himself in the Turkish culture for a period of 12 years. Impressions of Turkey During Twelve Years’ Wanderings gives a glimpse into the people and place of Turkey from one who was more than a passerby of the country. “When you have had a wide enough experience,” states Ramsay, “you can strike an average among your facts; but even then you can no longer feel that delightful confidence which sweeps you on from fact to fact and carries the reader with you.” He found that his first impressions of the country, cultivated over months, produced obvious-seeming ideas of who the Turks were and how to “fix” any problems that their culture produced. However, when months turned into years, he came to the realization that life is never that simple. A unique and engaging look at turn of the century Turkey.







The Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: The Clarendon Press
Publication Date: 1897
Pages: 481

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




An essay on the history of the city of Phrygia, this volume spans the earliest years of Turkey up until the Turkish Conquest. Ramsay’s wealth of knowledge of Turkish culture, geography, and the local people of the area assists him in illuminating the early years of this ancient, longstanding place.







Was Christ Born at Bethlehem? A Study on the Credibility of St. Luke

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1898
Pages: 295

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Studying the New Testament book of Luke—particularly Luke 2:1–4, a controversial passage regarding historical validity—Ramsay set out to prove that the material presented in this gospel is without a doubt factual. He examines the importance of the history contained in Luke, explaining its significance in assisting to answer the question of who Christ is. An appendix containing specimens of the documents to which Ramsay referenced ends the resource.







The Bearing of Recent Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the New Testament

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1915
Pages: 427

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




&ldquotI describe no striking discoveries. My aim is to state certain principles that result from modern discovery, and to illustrate their bearing on the New Testament,” says Ramsay. “The method is to show through the examination, word by word and phrase by phrase, of a few passages, which have been much exposed to hostile criticism, that the New Testament is unique in the compactness, the lucidity, the pregnancy and the vivid truthfulness of its expression.” Through his archaeological studies and traveling experiences, as well as his scholastic background, Ramsay is able to offer a compelling argument for the validity of the New Testament.







The Teaching of Paul in Terms of the Present Day: The Deems Lectures in New York University

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1914
Pages: 484

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This series of lectures was originally delivered in November, 1910, to students at New York University. Providing a detailed account of Paul’s life, education, and journeys, this volume also analyzes his thought process, literary style, and the doctrine proclaimed in his New Testament epistles. The chronology of his letters is examined, as is the historical accuracy, and the resource ends with several detailed indexes of words and scriptural references found within.

The Education of Christ: Hillside Reveries

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1902
Pages: 172

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Based on the travels and geographical knowledge Ramsay possessed, The Education of Christ portrays the life of Christ from a unique perspective. This volume, rich with descriptions of the places Jesus visited, shows what the author refers to as Christ’s education: the way he was affected by nature and the world around him.







A Historical Commentary on St. Paul’s Epistle to the Galatians

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Baker Book House
Publication Date: 1965
Pages: 504

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




“The attempt is made in this book to show how much light the epistle to the Galatians throws on contemporary history in the widest sense—the history of religion, society, thought, manners, education—in the Eastern provinces of the Empire,” states Ramsay. A thorough discussion of the book and history of Galatians is contained, relating the ancient culture to Ramsay’s day.







The Revolution in Constantinople and Turkey

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1909
Pages: 408

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Headed to Constantinople by train, Ramsay resolved to keep a journal of his Turkish adventures and the daily life of the locals. A fascinating analysis of the culture of Turkey at the turn of the twentieth century, this volume peers into the religion of the city, Christians of that time, and records conversations of Ramsay and his wife with Turks. Asia Minor during and after the revolution is also recorded.







The First Christian Century: Notes on Dr. Moffatt’s Introduction to the Literature of the New Testament

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1911
Pages: 216

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In an attempt to dispel inaccuracies in historical records, this volume engages a discussion of biblical criticism. As Ramsay says in regards to Christ, “That the most powerful and lasting movement of the human mind originated in the Church’s misunderstanding of a simple person, and was nursed in the ‘pseudonymous’ composition of legend or half-legend about him, is a theory against which I hope always to contend.” The volume centers around analysis of a lecture given by an important biblical scholar of the time, James Moffat.

Publisher: Hodder and Stoughton
Publication Date: 1909
Pages: 618

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Sparked by a visit to Asia Minor in the year 1882, William Mitchell Ramsay’s interest in rebuilding what he terms the “Thousand and One Churches” grew, until a point in 1907 when he found himself back in Asia Minor with friend Gertrude Bell. This account, divided into four parts, details Ramsay and Bell’s restoration efforts from that time forth, and is complete with extensive photographs, line drawings, maps, and plans of their work. A highly detailed, fascinating historical document.

Pauline and Other Studies in Early Christian History

Author: William Mitchell Ramsay
Publisher: A.C. Armstrong and Son
Publication Date: 1906
Pages: 415

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Pauline and Other Studies in Early Christian History anthologizes 15 of William Mitchell Ramsay’s best essays. These essays were culled from such prestigious journals as the Contemporary Review, Quarterly Review, Homiletical Review, and Expositor. The collection also contains 40 illustrations and two in-depth indexes. Essays included:

“Shall We Hear Evidence or Not?”
“The Charm of Paul”
“The Statesmanship of Paul”
“Pagan Revivalism and the Persecution of the Early Church”
“The Worship of the Virgin Mary at Ephesus”
“The Permanence of Religion at Holy Places in Western Asia”
“The Acts of the Apostles”
“The Lawful Assembly”
“The Olive-Tree and the Wild-Olive”
“Questions: With a Memory of Dr. Hort”
“St. Paul’s Road from Cicilia to Iconium”
“The Authorship of the Acts”
“A Study of St. Paul by Mr. Baring-Gould”
“The Pauline Chronology”
“Life in the Days of St. Basil the Great”



The book exhibits all those qualities which we are accustomed to look for in Professor Ramsay’s writings: freshness of standpoint, flashes of insight only possible to a scholar of rich and varied learning, unflagging zest in the handling of his subject—a zest which communicates itself to the reader—and that lucid and forcible style which has done so much to popularize the results of his investigations.
—American Journal of Theology
Not only does Professor Ramsay bring fresh and valuable instruction from the field of his special study, but he renders good service as a judicious moderator of the schools of critics.
—Outlook

It is the administrative force of Justice, and it is the necessary condition of freedom.”
