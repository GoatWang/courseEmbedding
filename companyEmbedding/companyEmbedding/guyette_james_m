My original divorce was in another state pro se, and I basically tied both my hands behind my back and didn’t even realize it. It was a hard fight, but there was absolutely no slacking on Ann’s part. I honestly believe the outcome of my custody issue was important to Ann, and legitimately cared. Ann provides a very reasonable rate based on your situation, and she won’t seek to nickel and dime you every chance she gets.  She also won’t drag the case as long as possible in order to get more money.  Understand, as most things in life, you can’t just throw money at her and then retire to the couch and expect a judgment in your favor.  Simply put, your results will be reflective of the effort you put in. Ann will ALWAYS do the best possible with what you provide her.   You will have to provide accurate information to her, and you will have to take ownership of your situation and do some work. (Constantly keeping your case in the ear of the guardian ad litem by writing him or her, keeping records of events,  and providing Ann all the ammunition you can for her to make your case. But she will not abandon you and will tell you exactly how and what you need to do. She will still write anything that needs to be official and provide you with an opportunity to review before submitted.) She is the type of attorney that works for big boys and girls with a sense of personal responsibility, and this is a huge tool she uses to keep her costs so reasonable.  Make no mistake, Ann will make good on her end of the bargain! She is at home in the courtroom/ mediation room and will ensure your side is heard loud and clear.  She has an uncanny way of arguing a case and maintaining the momentum; the whole time maintaining the upmost in professionalism.  Before your trial, Ann will give you advice of things you should or should not do. You may not always fully understand why initially, but FOLLOW IT.  She knows what she is doing. She never led me down a bad road and I know she won’t to you either.  Ann was NOT a ghost when I needed to talk to her. There were some times I had to talk to her as late as 11 oclock at night, and at some points during my ordeal talked to her every day of the week. I never paid 1 extra cent for those communications. She really cared, period.  Ann always gave me an accurate assessment of the situation. She didn’t lie or build up false hope. Then she fights like hell anyway making my argument.  If you are a dad with gumption that just wants what is fair, or a hard working single mom who is being bullied in the courtroom by some high dollar legal eagle, Ann is right for you.  Because of her, my daughter is now out or a really bad situation and now has chance at a bright, successful future.  Ann was able to secure primary placement for one of my children and get enforceable, fair visitation and rights for the other children.  I am honored to not only call Ann my counsel, but my friend. Thank you Ann Debt Advisors Law Offices MilwuakeeMèg C. ratedDebt Advisors was so very helpful to us.  Mike Georg is an excellent attorney. He sits down with you going over the differences between Chapters 13 &7. He analyzes your situation helping you to decide what's best. He is extremely intelligent & knowledgeable, has the utmost patience, and is very, very, kind.Laurie Bigsby was the attorney who went to court with us. She was terrific as well helping me to stay calm. That was no easy task! I was a wreck. But it all went very smoothly thanks to the entire staff at Debt Advisors. I highly recommend them to handle what can be a very traumatic thing to go through. They all, in particular Attorney Georg, makes what could be a horrific, stressful, thing to go through a very easy to handle event in your life. I am forever grateful for what Attorney Georg and his staff did for my husband and I. And, all that great service for the lowest price I could find in Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Waukesha, or Washington Counties!!! Thanks again Attorney Mike & staff for everything.MegSesini Law GroupBlanca C. ratedI take very serious other people's reviews and comments and I wanted to share my own experience with Sesini through a visa request for my family member and getting a waiver accepted and process quick, since my companion entered to America w/out a Visa. John Sesini and his team worked hard to get my husband's waiver through immigration (Perdon waiver) Sesini and his paralegal  Heydee Villafuerte worked on both cases for a little over a year, providing me updates and information that I needed as the case progress, they guided me what I needed to do in my end in order to be step ahead with paperwork that immigration needed as the case progressed, Sesini is approachable and helpful, he understand the need of having a family united and the frustration that immigrants go through when we feel the law is unfair with us. Sesini is also very honest since the beginning he told me that was not a easy case to resolved but he was going to do his best to get my companion's papers and pardon accepted.Law Office of Stephen M. GovinDoug W. ratedAttorney Stephen Govin is an outstanding Defense Attorney.  He represented our son in a two-count sexual assault case.  The case lasted 23 months, and he never tired, was relentless, meticulous, and pursued every court hearing and motion like it was the first one.  We sent many emails and made several calls to Attorney Govin, he was always there for us.  He was very strategic and detailed throughout the entire process, explaining each step and approach taken.  During the trial he was absolutely astonishing, he was focused and captured the attention of the jury during his witness questioning and closing arguments.  He delivered his message flawlessly, hammering on vital points.  He is on his way to becoming one of the best Defense Attorneys in the United States.  We are very fortunate to have discovered and reached-out to Attorney Govin.  Our son received not-guilty verdicts on both counts and the charges were acquitted. Our family will never forget his dedication through this ordeal.Gregg Bridge AttyMark W. ratedI was referred to Bridge Law Office, Gregg Bridge, from one of the best attorneys in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for my case, he could not take it, because he was retiring, when one of the best, gives You a reference, that,s, better then any review, You will ever read.Gregg Bridge, took my case, and what an outstanding attorney, he was liked ,by the Judge in mediation, and the Judge in court and trust me, that means a lot.

Murphy & Prachthauser main office at One Plaza East Building, Milwaukee Wisconsin - Phone: (414) 271-1011.Like · Gebhard Law OfficeDaniel S. ratedI would first like to say that I don't think I could've picked a better personal injury attorney to handle my case. Attorney Karl Gebhard, Melinda and his very professional and knowledgeable staff exceeded me and my wife's expectations with the settlement we were awarded. They were great at keeping me informed every step of the way as to how my case was progressing and if I ever had any questions or concerns, I could always get in touch with you any time. It was so gratifying to know that there are some really terrific dedicated lawyers out there that do have your best interests at heart. Thanks again Karl and Melinda and the rest of your staff for all your hard work, we really appreciate it. Women's Divorce & Legal Clinic, LLCJoan M. ratedWomen's Divorce and Legal Clinic not only represented me but supported me personally as I went through one of the most emotionally challenged periods of my life. My divorce was made much more difficult when my ex-husband hired an obstructionist attorney and Phyllis's staff was able to apply her bulldog tactics and achieve a positive outcome. Even after the final divorce when my ex-husband continued to try and manipulate the Courts I had the full personal support of the agency behind me.  It was through facing these tough challenges that helped me become the strong independent woman I am today and I really appreciate the personal touch that was provided by this law firm.  Mark Tishberg AttyHeath W. ratedAttorney Tishberg is one of the nicest people I have ever known. He won a civil trial for me in October of last year despite very difficult circumstances where he did a tremendous job and far exceeded my expectations of him. The following month, Attorney Tishberg won my criminal trial for me. He has recently drafted a contract as it relates to my business as good as the best attorney in the City of Milwaukee could have done. I am continually impressed with Attorney Tishberg's scope of knowledge as it relates to all legal matters. Attorney Tishberg even has an accounting degree and he has advised me in those matters as well. Thank you, Attorney Tishberg. For everything.Tabak Law, LLCLaquisha J. ratedTabak Law is one of the GREATEST services I have ever used! When it came time to apply for Disability Insurance, they took my information and assured me I had to do nothing else - they would handle all calls, forms, and submissions. I supplied the info they requested and waited.  Not only did we win my disability claim but they were successful in obtaining me over 2 years of back payments from the first day i went out on disability. Their service did not stop there.  They also worked with me to get the BEST Medicare plan when I became eligible!  I highly recommend Tabak Law to anyone who needs this type of assistance.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
