VALLEY FORGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UGI Corporation (NYSE:UGI) 
      announced today that Roger Perreault has been appointed to the newly 
      created position of President, UGI International. Mr. Perreault will be 
      joining UGI from Air Liquide, where he spent 21 years in various 
      leadership positions, most recently serving as Group Vice President,

      join the company in December.
    

      John Walsh, president and chief executive officer of UGI Corporation,

      ensuring the continued profitable growth of our International business 
      segment. Since acquiring Flaga GmbH in 1999, UGI has expanded to become 
      a premier distributor of LPG in 16 countries in Europe, operating under 
      four brands – Flaga, Antargaz, AvantiGas, and, most recently, Finagaz, 
      which we acquired in May 2015. The size and scope of our International 
      segment now demands an executive position to bring strategic vision and 
      oversee the collective development of this important segment.”
    

      As President, UGI International, Mr. Perreault will also lead the merger 
      and acquisition activities in Europe and have responsibility for UGI’s 
      global LPG supply strategy.

      served as President, Large Industries from 2008-2014 with responsibility 
      for Air Liquide’s North American large industries business. Prior to 
      that, he served as President, Air Liquide Brazil from 2005 to 2008 and 
      President, Air Liquide Chile from 2003 to 2005. Roger joined Air Liquide 
      Canada in 1994 and held various positions from operations management to 
      General Management. Prior to joining Air Liquide, Mr. Perreault was a 
      Production Manager with I.C.I. Explosives in Quebec, Canada.
    

      Mr. Perreault holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering 
      from Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario and a Graduate Diploma of
