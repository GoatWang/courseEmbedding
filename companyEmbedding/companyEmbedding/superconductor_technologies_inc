Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES)
With the congestion of power lines and their unstable tendencies, strategic injection of brief bursts of real power can play a crucial role in maintaining grid reliability. Small-scale Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) systems, based on low-temperature superconductors, have been in use for many years. These systems enhance the capacity and reliability of stability-constrained utility grids, as well as large industrial user sites with sensitive, high-speed processes, to improve reliability and power quality. 

Larger systems, and systems employing HTS, are a focus of development. Flywheels, based on frictionless superconductor bearings, can transform electric energy into kinetic energy, store the energy in a rotating flywheel and use the rotational kinetic energy to regenerate electricity as needed. Conventional flywheels suffer energy losses of 3-5% per hour, whereas HTS based flywheels operate at 0.1% loss per hour. Large and small demonstration units are in operation and development. Broad market use of HTS SMES devices is considered long-term. 





 Quick Fact - Superconducting magnetic energy storage systems will enhance the capacity and reliability of stability-constrained utility grids with sensitive, high-speed processes to improve reliability and power quality.

Fabrication of magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films at STI 

Since the discovery of superconductivity in MgB2, there has been marked progress in the ability to grow thin films of this material by the techniques of pulsed laser deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, and hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition. However, the efficacy of most of these methods is deleteriously affected by the particular challenges of MgB2 film growth, meaning they must employ sub-optimal growth temperatures or undesirable ex situ or in situ annealing procedures. Numerous difficulties thus remain regarding the routine deposition of completely in situ, smooth, robust, high-quality films which are useful for applications. In addition, the deposition method should also be compatible with multilayer deposition, double-sided deposition, and the growth of films on large-area substrates of technological interest. 
STI has developed a patented growth technique for MgB2 thin films which offers several advantages over existing methods and is the first deposition method to enable the production of high-quality MgB2 films for real-world applications. 

STI films possess among the highest TC values and lowest resistivity values reported. The TC values of our MgB2 films are 38 to >39 K, on par with the bulk value. The transition to the superconducting state is sharp, with widths ÎTC of ~0.2 K. These observations indicate that the films are clean. Films grown by our technique also have outstanding RF properties. The surface resistance (Rs ) values of our films are among the lowest reported in the literature. 

Our growth method enables fabrication of high-quality films on a number of different substrates, including single-crystal r-plane sapphire, c-plane sapphire, m-plane sapphire, 4H-SiC, MgO, LaAlO3 , NdGaO3 , LaGaO3, LSAT, SrTiO3 , YSZ, Si, and GaN. We have also grown high-quality films on titanium, niobium, and flexible metal and dielectric substrates. The technique enables deposition of high-quality films on any substrate for which there is not a chemical reaction with Mg or B. We have developed MgB2 thin film technologies for flexible flat ribbon cables, superconducting electronics, and superconducting cavities. At present we can deposit MgB2 wafers up to 4" in diameter. These are the largest-area MgB2 films available; moreover our apparatus is scalable to much larger sizes.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Superconducting Motors and Generators
Superconducting turbines and other rotating machines are expected to generate the largest future demand for superconducting wire. Coils utilizing superconducting wire will enable electric motors and generators to operate at much higher power densities. When compared to a copper wire based electric machine with equivalent output power, future superconducting motors and generators will enable a significant size reduction for the motors with higher efficiency. 

One potential sweet-spot for high-powered superconducting generators is expected to be 10+ megawatt offshore wind turbines. Offshore superconducting wind turbines promise to capture clean energy at a lower cost than competing renewables, while delivering power directly to growing coastal cities. Superconducting wind turbines are expected to play a unique role offshore since conventional technology cannot achieve the âpower per towerâ requirement. Although initial costs for large offshore turbines are higher due to the foundations and mechanical structures, these costs can be recouped by higher energy yields.












 Quick Fact - New, emerging, low cost and high performance superconducting technologies provide unique benefits targeting Smart Grid infrastructure improvement.

Superconductor Technologies Inc. Awarded U.S. Patent for HTS Wire Manufacturing System




















February 21, 2017 06:30 ET

 | Source: Superconductor Technologies Inc.






– Increases IP portfolio for its Conductus wire manufacturing – AUSTIN, Texas, Feb.  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Superconductor Technologies Inc. (STI) (Nasdaq:SCON) was awarded a U.S. Patent for a key aspect of the RCE-CDR system architecture used in manufacturing Conductus® HTS wire. This invention enables STI to efficiently monitor the evaporation conditions of multiple source materials used in the vacuum deposition chamber during the HTS growth process. U.S. Patent No. 9,567,661 entitled “Reactor Device With Removable Deposition Monitor” from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) protects the system design developed by STI to improve monitoring efficiency when evaporating materials in vacuum. This type of automated machine architecture utilized within the Reactive Co-evaporation (RCE) chamber, enables improved cycle time, higher throughput, and lower costs. “This patent reinforces the sustainable production advantages of our HTS wire manufacturing process,” stated Jeff Quiram, STI's president and CEO. “We design our systems to simplify the manufacturing process, which allow us to increase efficiency and reduce cycle time. One of the key advantages of our method is the utilization of removable monitoring tools that enable us to evaluate material evaporation status without disrupting the production process. In addition to saving time, this design reduces maintenance and cleaning requirements. Our team continues to develop and implement trade secrets that improve the economics of our Conductus wire and improve our commercial-scale capacity.” Reactive Co-evaporation and Cyclic Deposition Reaction (RCE-CDR) The RCE-CDR process grows a Rare Earth, Barium, Copper Oxide (ReBCO) superconductor film onto a flexible template. This process requires accurate temperature, uniform pressure, precise ratios of elements and the presence of oxidizing atmospheres to grow high performance superconducting materials. The RCE-CDR system is scaled for large batch operation to insure every portion of superconducting wire has uniform material properties. STI’s RCE-CDR process yields very high quality superconducting wire to maximize current carrying performance. About Superconductor Technologies Inc. (STI)Superconductor Technologies Inc. is a global leader in superconducting innovation. Its Conductus® superconducting wire platform offers high performance, cost-effective and scalable superconducting wire. With 100 times the current carrying capacity of conventional copper and aluminum, superconducting wire offers zero resistance with extreme high current density. This provides a significant benefit for electric power transmission and also enables much smaller or more powerful magnets for motors, generators, energy storage and medical equipment. Since 1987, STI has led innovation in HTS materials, developing more than 100 patents as well as proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. For more than 20 years STI utilized its unique HTS manufacturing process for solutions to maximize capacity utilization and coverage for Tier 1 telecommunications operators. Headquartered in Austin, TX, Superconductor Technologies Inc.'s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “SCON.” For more information about STI, please visit http://www.suptech.com. Safe Harbor Statement Statements in this press release regarding our business that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our limited cash and a history of losses; our need to materially grow our revenues from commercial operations and/or to raise additional capital (which financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) in the very near future, before cash reserves are depleted (which reserves are expected to be sufficient into the first quarter of 2017), to implement our current business plan and maintain our viability; the performance and use of our equipment to produce wire in accordance with our timetable; overcoming technical challenges in attaining milestones to develop and manufacture commercial lengths of our HTS wire; the possibility of delays in customer evaluation and acceptance of our HTS wire; the limited number of potential customers and customer pressures on the selling prices of our products; the limited number of suppliers for some of our components and our HTS wire; there being no significant backlog from quarter to quarter; our market being characterized by rapidly advancing technology; the impact of competitive products, technologies and pricing; manufacturing capacity constraints and difficulties; the impact of any financing activity on the level of our stock price; the dilutive impact of any issuances of securities to raise capital; the steps required to maintain the listing of our common stock with a U.S. national securities exchange and the impact on the liquidity and trading price of our common stock if we fail to maintain such listing; the cost and uncertainty from compliance with environmental regulations; and local, regional, and national and international economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us and our customers. Forward-looking statements can be affected by many other factors, including, those described in the "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections of STI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in STI's other public filings. These documents are available online at STI's website, www.suptech.com, or through the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. Forward-looking statements are based on information presently available to senior management, and STI has not assumed any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
