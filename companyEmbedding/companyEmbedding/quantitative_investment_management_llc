What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (12.07% upside)

                                Strategy Description




The Global Program pursues a fully systematic short-term trading strategy. The manager is quantitatively-focused and employs sophisticated, pattern-based time series prediction methods to capture short-term trading opportunities across global futures markets. These models are generally derived from cyclical analysis, statistical probabilities, momentum oscillators, and moving average of prices, among other methods. Due to its short-term focus, QIM provides a distinct return profile that exhibits a low level of correlation to both traditional market indices and longer-term managed futures strategies.

                            Biography: 
                        

Jaffray has over 20 years’ experience trading financial markets using proprietary quantitative models that he has developed. In 2003, Jaffray co-founded QIM to offer the Global Program to outside clients. He guides all aspects of QIM’s business and is chiefly responsible for the constant innovation and improvement of the models and techniques that underlie QIM’s predictions, trading, and risk management.
Jaffray served as head trader for Blue Ridge Trading from October 1991 to July 1994. He then founded Woodriff Trading as a CTA and managed client money there until October 1997. In January 1998, he joined Société Générale in its New York office, where he served for two years as a director in the Treasury department, trading proprietary funds in futures, currencies and U.S. equities. Following his departure from Société Générale in March 2000, Jaffray and Michael began managing their own money in a short-term, market-neutral equities program. This led them to co-found a broker-dealer, DHR. In October 2002, Jaffray also co-founded Biomind, a bioinformatics consulting and software firm. Jaffray graduated from the University of Virginia in 1991 with a B.S. in Commerce.

                        There are substantial risks and conflicts of interests associated with Managed Futures and commodities accounts, and you should only invest risk capital. The success of an investment is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (CTA) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. CTAs have total trading authority, and the use of a single CTA could mean a lack of diversification and higher risk. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses as well as gains. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. If you use notional funding, you may lose more than your initial cash investment. Managed Futures and commodities accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The disclosure document contains a complete description of each fee to be charged to your account by a CTA. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation. PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

Glossary







Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) provide advice and services related to trading and investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. Each CTA is characterized by its respective trading strategy and the markets it trades. CTAs are regulated by the United States federal government through registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and membership in the National Futures Association (NFA)†.
The CTA information presented on www.ctaperformance.com was compiled by Equinox Fund Management, LLC, based upon information provided by each respective manager of commodity futures and foreign currency trading programs tracked by Equinox Fund Management and its affiliates. The CTA performance information does not contain opinion or analysis of Equinox Fund Management or any of its affiliates, and the completeness and accuracy of performance information reported to Equinox Fund Management cannot in all cases be independently verified. Please note that the CTA performance may not be reflective of actual fund performance. For the most recent performance figures, please refer to each respective commodity trading advisors website or marketing literature.
Performance information illustrated on this site is "net" of all fees and charges, and includes interest income applicable to the accounts comprising each composite performance summary. Performance results of individual accounts may vary as a result of differing fees, account size, the timing of entry of orders, and other factors. The performance results are not indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future.

Company background
Founded in 2003 by Jaffray Woodriff and Michael Geismar.
Investment goal
The program seeks to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns through the use of proprietary, machine-learning, and predictive techniques. Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading. The resulting system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation.
Markets traded
FX, metals, agriculturals, equity indices, intererst rates, energy
Strategy
The Global Program employs quantitative models that utilize pattern recognition techniques to predict price movements.  The program seeks to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns through the use of proprietary, machine-learning, and predictive techniques. Only those models that prove to be the most robust, statistically significant, and conceptually diverse are used in actual trading.  The resulting system of models offers what QIM believes to be reliable signals that guide market timing and trade allocation. The portfolio is diversified across the 6 sectors (i.e., currencies, metals, agricultural commodities, equity indices, interest rates, and energy) and multiple markets. The average trade length for the program is one to two weeks. The holding period for all trades typically ranges from 1 to 50 days.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
