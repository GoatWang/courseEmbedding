																				 
									
A balanced approach to growing and protecting your wealth.


Bourgeon Capital Management, LLC was founded in 1999 on the belief that a boutique investment counselor, with a clear, single-minded focus on clients can serve wealthy individuals and their families far better than a large investment company.
While our clients have attained their wealth in different ways, they all share one thing in common: to have their assets managed in a manner that preserves and enhances their wealth.
We focus on stewardship, not product sales. We offer engagement and tailored portfolios, not cookie-cutter solutions. We promote diversification, not specialization. We believe in time-tested solutions, not following trends — and we are always risk-aware.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

A balanced approach to growing and protecting your wealth.


Bourgeon Capital Management, LLC was founded in 1999 on the belief that a boutique investment counselor, with a clear, single-minded focus on clients can serve wealthy individuals and their families far better than a large investment company.
While our clients have attained their wealth in different ways, they all share one thing in common: to have their assets managed in a manner that preserves and enhances their wealth.
We focus on stewardship, not product sales. We offer engagement and tailored portfolios, not cookie-cutter solutions. We promote diversification, not specialization. We believe in time-tested solutions, not following trends — and we are always risk-aware.
