      ■ David C. Novak was the chairman and CEO of Yum! Brands, an
      independent, publicly owned fast-food franchiser that in 2004 was made up
      of six subsidiaries organized around five core restaurants: Pizza Hut,
      KFC, Taco Bell, Long John Silver's, and A&W All-American
      Food. Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell, and Long John Silver's were the
      global leaders in the quick-service pizza, chicken, Mexican, and seafood
      categories, respectively. Serving its signature frosty-mug root beer
      drinks since 1919, A&W All-American Food was the longestoperating
      quick-service U.S. franchise chain. Due greatly to Novak's creative
      management and organizational style, Yum! Brands' global sales
      totaled more than $24 billion in 2002.
    

      FROM PEPSICO TO TRICON TO YUM! BRANDS
    

      Novak started his career in the advertising field, holding leadership
      positions over a 20-year period primarily with the

      advertising agency Tracey-Locke BBDO (now TLP Tracey Locke Partnership).
      There he eventually reached the position of executive vice president, as
      which he supervised client relationships, including those with PepsiCo and
      Frito-Lay. Novak later held similar positions at Pizza Hut, PepsiCo, and
      KFC. Starting in 1986 he became senior vice president of marketing at
      Pizza Hut, reaching the same position at PepsiCo in 1990. In 1992 he
      became chief operating officer of Pepsi-Cola North America. Novak became
      president of KFC's North American operations in 1994 and group
      president and CEO of the North American operations of both KFC and Pizza
      Hut in 1996. He became president and vice chairman of the board at Tricon
      Global Restaurants when it came into existence on October 7, 1997, as a
      result of a spin-off from PepsiCo, which had owned and franchised the KFC,
      Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell
       brands worldwide. Novak served in these capacities until December 1999.
    

      NOVAK AT THE HELM
    

      Novak was named the chief executive officer of Tricon Global Restaurants
      in January 2000, succeeding Tricon's first CEO Andy Pearson; a year
      later, on January 1, 2001, Novak became Tricon's chairman. During
      Pearson's time as CEO, he and Novak worked together closely in
      focusing on three main goals: to correct the management problems left over
      from the company's time under PepsiCo, to increase the
      competitiveness of its four operating companies, and to capitalize on
      opportunities for multibranding, international growth, and increased
      scale.
    

      During this time span, first under Pearson and later under Novak,
      Tricon's performance dramatically increased with respect to profit
      and sales growth, debt payment, margin improvement, return on investment,
      and employee commitment. In fact, Novak's excellent grasp of the
      nature of the CEO position allowed Pearson to bring him up to the top
      management spot earlier than had been expected. Pearson called Novak a
      driving force behind Tricon's great performance—with a
      remarkable grasp of the company's business, outstanding skills as a
      conceptual management leader, and superior operating expertise.
      Appropriately, in a 1999 press release, upon stepping down from the top
      position, Pearson said of Novak, "David is the most effective
      leader I have ever worked with" (November 15, 1999).
    

      UNITING A NEW COMPANY
    

      Novak immediately faced an ominous challenge in uniting the global
      fast-food brands of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. The three individual
      companies were floundering and, just as seriously, were mutually
      suspicious of each other's management styles. By utilizing the same
      people-friendly attitude, quality-service standards, comprehensive vision,
      and product innovations that he had used to help turn KFC around in the
      mid-1990s, Novak took and molded the three restaurants into a cohesive
      partnership with division leaders who cooperated with rather than competed
      against one another.
    

      Novak was able to transform the company with regards to its franchisee
      relationships; in retrospect, Novak was considered to be the mastermind
      and architect of Tricon's successful and profitable one-system
      company. In the first five years following the spin-off, Tricon increased
      systemwide sales by 8 percent, more than doubling operating earnings per
      share, and improved return on invested capital by 10 percentage points.
    

      HYPERCOMPETITIVE AND GENEROUS
    

      Novak's skillful management tactics were credited with influencing
      the cultural shift that was eventually incorporated into Tricon. He was
      characterized as wearing many hats during the changeover: those of
      captain, friend, mentor, politician, and team player. Novak was described
      by many observers as a man so hypercompetitive that he frequently went
      "for the jugular" when urgency called for such action. As
      quoted in an article in 
      
        Brandweek
      
      , John Neal, the president of JRN who operated one hundred KFC units, said
      of Novak, "He is one of the most competitive leaders that I have
      ever sat across the table from. He will beat you whether in golf, poker,
      or basketball. He just isn't going to lose" (October 11,
      1999).
    

      Novak's competitiveness, however, was grounded in a leadership
      style that was also generous when it came to recognizing and rewarding
      individuals who had performed well. Rather than dictating the manner in
      which work should be done, Novak used a "buy-in" approach to
      accomplish projects with a team attitude. In 1995, when he was working
      exclusively for KFC, he used one thousand autographed rubber chickens to
      generate employee, supplier, and manager support around a new
      employee-recognition program. Pizza Hut and Taco Bell then instituted
      their own employee-recognition programs centered around the Big Cheese and
      the Royal Order of the Pepper Awards, respectively.
    

      Such concepts, according to Novak, helped company employees create
      positive experiences each and every time a customer entered their
      restaurants. Novak remarked that these tactics, which he constantly
      reinforced, had far greater long-term impact on brand perceptions than
      even television advertisements. In general Novak called this approach
      "Customer Mania," saying that it improved the method with
      which each restaurant interacted with its customers and "put a
      'Yum' on their faces all around the world" (YUM.com).
    

      YUM! BRANDS CREATED
    

      In March 2002 Tricon declared that it would be acquiring the Lexington,
      Kentucky–based Yorkshire Global Restaurants as well as its two
      brands: Long John Silver's and A&W All-American Food. At
      that time Novak announced the company's intention to change its
      name to Yum! Brands in order to better reflect its expanding portfolio of
      restaurants as well as its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol, YUM. On
      May 7, 2002, the Yorkshire acquisition was finalized, showing the extent
      to which Novak and the company were committed to multibranding. On May 16,
      2002, a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting
      officially changed the company's name from Tricon Global
      Restaurants to Yum! Brands. In 2002 the company's U.S. sales
      totaled $7.78 billion, as produced by a workforce of 244,000 employees.
    

      LONG-TERM STRATEGY
    

      Novak's Yum! Brands, a Fortune 300 company, had become one of the
      largest quick-serve restaurant companies in the world, trailing only
      McDonald's in sales. Yum! Brands did eventually grow to the point
      where it outnumbered its hamburger competitor in terms of system units,
      with nearly 33,000 units in more than one hundred countries and
      territories. The company owned and operated about one-fifth of its stores,
      franchising the remainder.
    

      Under Novak's direction the company's long-term strategy
      built on Yum! Brands' foundation as a worldwide brand franchiser.
      Novak's five areas of long-term focus, which were considered
      essential to the company's growth and progress, included multibrand
      expansion, international expansion, the company's portfolio of
      category-leading U.S. brands, worldwide franchise fees, and strong cash
      generation and returns.
    

      MULTIBRANDING
    

      Novak instituted multibranding, a concept that provided consumers with
      more choices and convenience at a single location hosting a combination of
      KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, A&W All-American Food, or Long John
      Silver's restaurants. Under Novak, Yum! Brands became the worldwide
      leader in multibranding with over 1,800 domestic multibranded restaurants,
      representing nearly 10 percent of total traditional U.S. units. Over two
      thousand multibranded restaurants worldwide generated nearly $2 billion in
      annual sales, and in 2002 Yum! Brands was opening three new restaurants
      outside the United States each day. In addition Novak bought into a
      portion of Yan Can, the start-up casual, quick-service Asian restaurant
      chain.
    

      Novak directed the development, operation, licensing, and franchising of a
      system of both traditional and nontraditional units in each of the
      company's brands. Nontraditional units included kiosks and express
      units that had a more limited menu and operated in nontraditional
      locations like airports, amusement parks, colleges, gas and convenience
      stores, and stadiums, where traditional, full-scale outlets would not be
      efficient or profitable.
    

      STRESSING DIVERSITY
    

      Under Novak's direction Yum! Brands was named one of 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine's 50 Best Companies for Minorities for its comprehensive
      adherence to key diversity measures. This honor was bestowed upon Yum!
      Brands based on the survey that appeared in 
      
        Fortune
      
      's July 7, 2003, issue. The authors of the article described how
      surveyors measured minority representation throughout organizations in
      such categories as the board of directors, the 50 highest-paid executives,
      purchasing from minority firms, diversity training, recruitment and
      retention, and charitable contributions to minority organizations.
    

      The results showed that Yum! Brands led all companies for managerial
      diversity and was ranked among the top 10 companies having the highest
      percentage of African American employees. In all, 54 percent of the
      company's U.S. workforce, including 53 percent of recent hires,
      comprised minorities. Novak remarked in a press release that "Yum!
      Brands' commitment to diversity helps drive all aspects of our
      business" (June 26, 2003). He further stated that the
      company's diversity strategy included leadership development,
      purchasing, franchising, and community involvement.
    

      PHILANTHROPY EFFORTS TARGET MINORITIES
    

      Novak was actively involved in Yum! Brands' philanthropy efforts
      targeting minorities. In 2002 the company almost tripled its charitable
      contributions to minority communities and the volunteer involvement of its
      employees through initiatives such as the Dare to Care Food Bank, based in
      Louisville, Kentucky. Yum! Brands committed one million dollars annually
      to the Food Bank; two-thirds of that total would help the Food Bank in
      supporting upwards of 46,000 undernourished children in minority
      communities lacking in resources.
    

      Novak, through Yum! Brands, also supported charitable organizations such
      as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
      League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Urban League, the
      National Council of LaRaza, the National Minority Supplier Development
      Council, the MultiCultural Foodservice and Hospitality Alliance, the
      National Minority Franchising Initiative, the American Indian College
      Fund, and the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce.

David C. Novak to step down as Yum chairman/CEO



Will transition to executive chairman; Greg Creed will become CEO
Will transition to executive chairman; Greg Creed will become CEO
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (May 1, 2014) – Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE:YUM) announced today that its chairman and CEO David C. Novak, 61, will become executive chairman on Jan. 1, 2015, transitioning from his current role. Novak has served as CEO since 1999, building a global restaurant powerhouse with more than 40,000 restaurants in 125 countries.
Once he becomes executive chairman, Novak is forming the office of the chairman. In addition to Novak, it will be comprised of Sam Su, 62, who will continue to serve as Yum Brands vice-chairman and chairman/CEO of the Yum China Division; and Greg Creed, 56, who will become the next CEO of Yum Brands and will join Novak and Su on the company’s board of directors on Jan. 1.
David Novak, CEO of Louisville-based Yum! Brands, will transition to executive chairman of the company on Jan. 1, 2015.
“This new office of the chairman will partner as a triumvirate on overall corporate strategy and leadership development to propel continued growth,” Novak said.
The day-to-day accountability for leading Yum will be transitioned to Creed on Jan. 1. Until then, he will continue to serve in his current role as CEO of Taco Bell and work with Novak to develop the company’s 2015 operating plan and to ensure a seamless transition. As Yum’s CEO, Creed will lead the overarching strategies, structure, people development and culture that will drive sales and profitability at all of the company’s businesses worldwide. All Yum functional leaders and divisions will report to Creed, a 20-year veteran with the company.
“Greg Creed is the ideal leader to become our next CEO,” Novak said. “First and foremost, he walks the talk of our culture and is determined to take it to the next level. Next, he is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of results. He made Taco Bell an industry leader, elevating the brand’s esteem and establishing top-tier customer service levels. He is a breakthrough thinker, creating new day parts such as FourthMeal and breakfast, as well as major product lines, such as Doritos Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell.”
“Last but not least, he has a passion for our global business, rooted with international positions at Unilever and at KFC and Pizza Hut in Australia and New Zealand,” Novak added. “He is a well-rounded executive having previously served as Yum Brands chief operations officer. There is no doubt in my mind he is fully qualified and equipped with the positive energy we need to lead the company to the next level.”

Yum! Brands Chairman and CEO and Philanthropist David C. Novak to Receive 2015 Horatio Alger Award

		  Horatio Alger Association annually recognizes exceptional leaders, across industries, who have achieved great success despite facing significant personal adversities

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, Inc., a nonprofit educational organization honoring the achievements of outstanding individuals and encouraging youth to pursue their dreams through higher education, today announced that David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, Yum! Brands, Inc., has been selected for membership in the prestigious organization.  Mr. Novak joins eleven other accomplished business and civic leaders from across North America in receiving this honor in 2015.  Since its establishment in 1947, the Horatio Alger Award is annually bestowed upon renowned leaders who have succeeded, despite facing adversity, and who are committed to both philanthropy and higher education.
Mr. Novak was born in Beeville, Texas and lived a nomadic childhood. His father's job consisted of marking latitudes and longitudes for mapmakers, so every three months, Mr. Novak's family would pack up and move their 40-foot trailer to the next small town.  By seventh grade, he had lived in 32 trailer parks in 23 states.  With the support and encouragement of his parents, Mr. Novak was the first person in his family to get a college education, graduating from the University of Missouri in 1974 with a degree in journalism and a major in advertising.  Following graduation, he married his college sweetheart, Wendy, with only $19 in the bank.  He joined an advertising agency in D.C. as a copywriter while working as a night desk clerk for Holiday Inn.  Mr. Novak later joined Ketchum to work on Heinz and then Tracy Locke to manage PepsiCo's Frito-Lay and Doritos accounts.  Shortly thereafter he became Chief Marketing Officer of PepsiCo's Pizza Hut division, and then Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales for Pepsi-Cola.  He created award-winning marketing campaigns for Pepsi and Mountain Dew and moved Pepsi from carbonated soft drinks to a total beverage company.  He became COO of Pepsi-Cola, then CEO of KFC U.S., and later CEO of both KFC and Pizza Hut U.S.  In 1997, PepsiCo spun off KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and Mr. Novak became Vice Chairman and President of the new company – Yum! Brands.  He was promoted to CEO in 1999, and Chairman in 2000.  He transitions to Executive Chairman on January 1, 2015.  
Mr. Novak has been recognized as "2012 CEO of the Year" by Chief Executive magazine, one of the world's "30 Best CEOs" by Barron's, one of the "Top People in Business" by FORTUNE and one of the "100 Best-Performing CEOs in the World" by Harvard Business Review.  He has built Yum! into one of the world's largest restaurant companies, doubling its size to 40,000 restaurants in 125 countries with 1.5 million employees.  Under Mr. Novak's leadership since its spin-off from PepsiCo in 1997, Yum! Brands has established itself as a global powerhouse going from approximately 20 percent of its profits coming from outside the United States to nearly 70 percent in 2013, while remaining an industry leader in return on invested capital. In so doing, the Company's stock has risen almost 16 percent annually and its market capitalization has grown from $4.4 billion to $34.4 billion.  Additionally, Mr. Novak devotes much of his time each year to personally train leadership skills to the Company's management and franchisees, emphasizing teamwork and a belief in people that rewards and recognizes customer-focused behavior with his trademarked Taking People With You program. His book based on the highly successful program, TAKING PEOPLE WITH YOU: The Only Way to Make BIG Things Happen (January 2012), is a New York Times and Wall Street Journal best-seller. He has donated all of his proceeds from the book, along with the proceeds of his autobiography, THE EDUCATION OF AN ACCIDENTAL CEO: Lessons Learned from the Trailer Park to the Corner Office, as well as speaking engagement fees to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), raising close to $2 million for hunger relief. 
"Horatio Alger, Jr. wrote stories about hard work being the key to success, and no one embodies that more than David Novak," said Tony Novelly, president and CEO, Horatio Alger Association and 2000 Horatio Alger Award recipient.  "Despite the transience of his early years, his ability to quickly adapt and seize opportunities allowed him to succeed in situations that might have defeated others.  His remarkable career, rooted in an unshakeable belief in himself, and his exceptional generosity make Mr. Novak a natural selection for the Horatio Alger Award and we proudly welcome him as a lifetime Member of the Association."   
Mr. Novak has made considerable contributions to the fight against world hunger.  Under his leadership, Yum! has raised and donated $600 million in cash and food since 2007 to the WFP and other relief agencies.  He is on the board of WFP USA and is a recipient of the 2012 UN World Food Program Leadership Award and the 2008 Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship.  Mr. Novak and his wife Wendy established the Lift a Life Foundation in 1999, and have helped thousands in need with hunger relief, early childhood education, juvenile diabetes, military family support and leadership development.  The couple also founded the Wendy L. Novak Juvenile Diabetes Center in Louisville, where they reside.  In 2012, Lift a Life Foundation and USA TODAY Charitable Foundation launched "Lead2Feed World Hunger Leadership Challenge" to encourage middle and high school students to hone their leadership skills through hunger relief projects using principles from TAKING PEOPLE WITH YOU. Since its inception, nearly half a million middle and high school students at more than 2,500 schools and clubs have participated in the "Lead2Feed World Hunger Leadership Challenge" for a chance to win over $250,000 in prize money grants to student teams for U.S. public charities engaged in hunger relief programs. 
In accepting this honor, Mr. Novak commented, "It is both humbling and a privilege to be selected as a Member of the Horatio Alger Association. It's crucial for every leader to know who they are and where they've been. Growing up, even though my family moved around a lot, I was fortunate to have the kind of loving and encouraging parents you could only dream of.  I've also been lucky to work for world-class coaches throughout my career and have had an incredible partner for 40 years, my wife Wendy. All of these amazing experiences and people have shaped my leadership style and passion to give back to others. I strongly believe in the Association's mission and I look forward to supporting their ongoing commitment to develop the next generation of American leaders." 
In addition to presenting its annual award, Horatio Alger Association administers one of the largest, privately-funded scholarship programs for students in the United States and Canada.  These students, like the Members, have faced significant adversities, but have persevered and are determined to overcome life's challenges.  Scholarships are wholly funded through private donations from Members, Life Partners and friends, and since 1984, the Association has provided more than $100 million to promising students in need.
Mr. Novak and the Member Class of 2015 will be officially welcomed into the organization during the 68th Annual Horatio Alger Award Induction Ceremonies in Washington, D.C. April 9-11, 2015.  In addition to recognizing these tremendous leaders, Horatio Alger Association will also honor its 2015 National Scholarship recipients, affording both groups the opportunity to meet and learn from one another.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
