Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Endurance International Group 2015 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Angela White, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Angela White - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Chanel. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. First, we'll go through some prepared remarks, after which we'll turn to Q&A. We've prepared a presentation to accompany our comments, which is available at the IR section of our website at ir.endurance.com. While not necessary to follow along, we recommend referencing the presentation slides alongside our prepared remarks.
As is customary, let me now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements made on today's call will include forward-looking statements about Endurance's future expectations, plans and prospects. All such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary language in today's earnings release and to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 6, 2015, and our Form 8K/A filed with the SEC on January 21, 2016 for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Endurance does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
During this call, we will present several non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, UFCF as reported, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, adjusted revenue, and average revenue per subscriber. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the presentation located at the IR section of our website.
With that, I'll turn you over to Hari Ravichandran, our Founder and CEO.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Angela. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. We're very pleased with our results for the year. GAAP revenue grew 18% year-over-year, GAAP net loss was $26 million and GAAP cash from operations was $177 million, reflecting 24% year-over-year growth.
Full-year adjusted revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $747 million. Full-year adjusted EBITDA grew 14% year-over-year to $267 million. Unlevered free cash flow as reported grew 14% year-over-year and free cash flow grew 23% year-over-year.
We believe that free cash flow growth will provide us continued opportunity and flexibility and we're pleased to see continued strong growth in this metric. In addition, our total subscriber base increased during the year from $4.1 million to $4.7 million at an ARPS of $14.29.
On slide 5. In addition to finishing a year of healthy growth, we also made progress on our previously announced acquisition of Constant Contact. Last week on February 9, we completed the transaction paying Constant Contact shareholders $32 per share. The total transaction value was $1.1 billion. Net of cash on the Constant Contact balance sheet, the purchase price was approximately $900 million.

We remain very excited about the combination of our subscriber acquisition funnel, product capabilities, talented pool of employees and the opportunity to provide SMBs with a full suite of tools for online marketing services.
Our integration timeline is progressing as planned. Shortly after close of the transaction, we implemented our first phase of integration. We notified employees of head count reductions and also began consolidating field office functions. Initial plans include the winding down of the San Francisco, United Kingdom and Florida footprints, and delivering these functions through the Waltham headquarters office.
We continue to anticipate reaching our originally targeted annual run rate cost synergies of $55 million starting at the end of 2016, with potential upside in revenue and marketing synergies. Both teams have worked diligently to meet our timelines, and we're all focused on building the best teams to move forward.
I would like to welcome the members of the Constant Contact family and its leadership team. Gail Goodman will be moving on to Other Ventures, while Harp Grewal, former CFO of Constant Contact, will lead the brand's operations. Joe Hughes will continue to head up the Emerging Ventures Group, and Ken Surdan will continue to lead the Product and Development Group. Both will work closely with the Endurance team on product development and innovation.
Over the last few months, we also completed the financing related to the transaction. On February 9, we closed on an incremental term loan in the amount of $735 million and $350 million in unsecured notes, and replaced our existing $125 million revolving credit facility with a new $165 million revolving credit facility. We believe that we'll be able to de-lever quickly if we achieve our targeted growth and adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow generation.
Importantly, as part of this acquisition, we believe we have the opportunity to reduce cost and better balance top line and investment in order to drive accretive EBITDA and future cash flows. Our plan for the reduction in cost was based primarily on head count reductions, which accounts for $48 million of the $55 million in targeted annual run rate synergies. With the head count reductions last week, we eliminated approximately $30 million in annual run rate costs. We intend to continue to balance costs and investments appropriately across our brands in order to continue to leverage our scale.
The combination of Endurance and Constant Contact positions us firmly as a leader in the SMB online marketing products and services space. We're excited to add enhanced product and technology capabilities to our existing foundation as we have expanded beyond Web presence to a full suite of SMB products and services.
Importantly, we believe that the transaction will benefit us operationally and financially. As our scale continues to build, we will be able to leverage our position in technology, marketing channels, and product to support longer-term growth and value creation.
In fiscal year 2016, we expect approximately $1.2 billion in revenue and approximately $400 million in adjusted EBITDA. Endurance exited the year with momentum in recent initiatives. Our site builder product, which launched in the second half of 2015 is showing much promise. We're excited with the traction to-date and regard this as an example of the results we can achieve through a combined effort, innovating at a fast pace in order to deliver a product that SMB's value.
In Q4, we launched our mobile site builder product, Impress.ly, which allows SMBs to easily aggregate components of their Web presence. We continue to roll out adjacent products and services that can be secured through one central marketing funnel. In the same vein, we recently rolled out a resume builder tool, which has aimed at helping SMB's network and find potential candidates.

In addition to the recent Constant Contact close, in Q4 we acquired the assets of IX Web Hosting for a total consideration of $28 million. IX provides core web hosting services targeted at SMBs. Subsequent to quarter end, we increased our equity ownership on our site builder joint venture WZ UK, Ltd. Starting in Q1 2016, results of this business will be consolidated with our financial results, which we've been working toward since our initial investment in the joint venture in Q3 of fiscal 2014.
Internationally, we continue to make progress as well. GAAP revenue from subscribers from international geographies totaled 37% of our revenue, an increase from 35% of GAAP revenue in the last fiscal year. The vast majority of our transactions take place in U.S. dollars, which has minimized currency impact to the top line. We continue to see benefit from our investment in Brazil with higher-than-average revenue growth rates. We plan to launch our mobile site builder product in the Brazilian market during H1.
Turning to our partnership pipeline, we launched a partnership with Kabbage, a company that fulfills working capital needs for SMBs. We continue to view partnerships as a way to test interest in certain products and garner key insights into our subscriber base.
As we noted last August, we reorganized primary lines of responsibility between our flagship businesses from our newer gateway businesses which are at higher growth rates. These include our site builder, cloud gateways, mobile site builder, and other solutions. Ron LaSalvia will continue to head up the organization's flagship business and will fold responsibility for the Constant Contact brand. Ron has done an amazing job heading up these efforts as Chief Operating Officer. I am pleased to announce that he will serve in the role of President in addition to Chief Operating Officer, formalizing the role he has played organizationally.
On slide 9. We're excited at all that we have accomplished during the past fiscal year. We believe that our efforts and investments will reap benefits in years to come. Over the years, our business has expanded, and we've done so by setting a strategy and investing ahead of the curve. This year is no different. We plan to invest significantly more in program marketing, while balancing top and bottom line growth appropriately. We believe our focus will drive new subscribers to platform where we can provide solutions to help them grow their businesses. We're excited about 2016 and feel confident in our ability to reach our targets.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc Montagner, our Chief Financial Officer.
Marc Montagner - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Hari. On slide 11, we could see that we are very happy with our full-year result. For the full year ending December 31, 2015, adjusted revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $747 million within our guidance of $745 million to $750 million. Adjusted EBITDA grew at 14% year-over-year to $267.5 million within our guidance of $265 million to $270 million. Capital expenditure were less than 5% of adjusted revenue. And free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operation less CapEx and capitalized lease, grew 23% year-over-year to $141.2 million resulting in free cash flow per share of $1.07 for the year.
Slide 12. In the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted revenue was $194.7 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was $71.8 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16%. And free cash flow was $33.4 million, resulting in free cash flow per share of $0.25. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by transaction expenses, integration charges, restructuring expenses and legal-related expenses of approximately $6.9 million.
On slide 13, you could see the total subscriber on the platform increased during 2015 by over 550,000 to approximately 4.7 million subs. Average revenue per subscriber for the full year was $14.29 versus $14.48 for the same period a year ago. Our forecast is on increasing our total subscriber count in a profitable way. ARPS is being pressured by subscriber coming to our platform through lower-priced product and new subscribers being loaded at low introductory prices in the first year. In 2016, just like in 2015, we will focus on increasing our subscriber numbers.

Slide 14. Last quarter, we noted that we had identified errors while migrating data from our legacy business intelligence system to an upgraded BI system. These errors impacted certain operating metrics. We are reporting our corrected metrics going back to the fourth quarter 2013, which is the time at which the company went public.
At the top of the slide, you could see the evolution of product per subs or PPS since the fourth quarter of 2013. We define PPS as the number of product purchased across our platform divided by a subscriber at the end of the period, whether bundled or individually. In the revised PPS, the updated numbers have been corrected to adjust for coding errors that we discovered last quarter.
We also only counted subscriber who meet our definition of total subscriber for our major brands shown on the slide, and we made the methodology consistent across multiple brands. You will note that there was a significant increase in PPS in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an adjustment that eliminated inactive customers from our subscriber count, which were first identified as such in that same quarter.
The middle chart shows you the correct number of subscribers spending over $500 per year with us. As you can see here, the actual numbers were lower than originally disclosed as a result of coding errors, but still reflect a positive trend. The third chart reflect our monthly recurring revenue or MRR numbers, which remain unchanged at 99% after a full recalculation of these metrics.
As we stated in the past, our correction of PPS and subscribers spending more than $500 per year with us did not impact our GAAP financial result, adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, or unlevered free cash flow metrics. This does not impact ARPS, subscriber count, churn or unit economics.
Given the material contribution of Constant Contact to our business, and the difference in subscriber profile, we will no longer report PPS or the number of subscribers spending over $500. We're currently reviewing the metrics that we would provide to investors in the future. In addition, for the next four quarters, we plan to break out Constant Contact revenues in our disclosure.
Let's turn to guidance for 2016 on slide 15. We have previously provided guidance on a quarterly and annual basis. Starting this fiscal year, we are moving to annual guidance for adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditure, and free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operation minus CapEx and capitalized leases. We will no longer provide guidance for unlevered free cash flow as reported.
Given the timing of the close of the acquisition of Constant Contact on February 9, 2016, our 2016 result will not include a full contribution from Constant Contact. Our guidance for 2016 therefore includes pro forma full-year numbers, as well as number based on the date of close. This guidance does not assume any incremental M&A.
For 2016, we expect annual adjusted revenue expectation for full-year pro forma of the Constant Contact acquisition of more than $1.225 million, expected adjusted revenue based on the date of close of greater than $1.175 million, expected adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis of approximately $405 million, expected adjusted EBITDA based on the date of close of approximately $400 million, and CapEx of approximately $60 million for the year.
This year, we expect significant transaction expenses related to financing, option acceleration and restructuring charges associated with the Constant Contact deal, which would impact free cash flow. Excluding these expenses, we expect free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operation less CapEx, of $180 million to $190 million. Including the impact of these expenses, which we expect to be approximately $40 million, we expect free cash flow of $140 million to $150 million.

On a combined pro forma basis, we continue to expect $55 million in pro forma annual run rate synergies in 2016. As noted earlier, we eliminated approximately $30 million in annual run rate costs last week with the head count reduction.
I would also like to highlight some items underlying these assumptions. Revenue expectation remain as previously stated. As we streamline operation at Constant Contact, our objective is to maximize free cash flow and focus on profitable growth. We expect to grow Constant Contact at low- to mid-single digit, while we optimize operation and marketing spend. The balance of the gross will come from Endurance product.
As Hari noted, we expect to increase investment in marketing significantly in 2016. Based on the testing done last year and the corresponding marketing yield, we see opportunity to invest behind the Endurance brand in fiscal 2016.
On slide 16, you could see that we financed the Constant Contact transaction through an incremental $1.085 billion in new debt, $735 million in incremental seven-year term loan at a rate of L+500 and $350 million in unsecured note at a coupon of 10.875% with an eight-year maturity.
We also raised a new five-year revolving credit facility in aggregate amount of $165 million, which is undrawn at this stage, and replace the old revolver of $125 million. The spread on our existing term loan has increased to L+523 and will likely further increase to L+548 on February 28. We expect to pay approximately $140 million in cash interest in 2016.
With this transaction, we're able to improve our financial flexibility, adding approximately $50 million of cash to our balance sheet and providing additional liquidity with the undrawn revolver in place, while also extending out maturities. Our next scheduled maturity is November 2019 on the existing term loan.
Based on our pro forma view of last 12 months, adjusted EBITDA at December 31, 2015 this translate into leverage of 4.4 turns on a secured basis and 5.3 turns on unsecured basis. Objective is to reduce total debt to adjusted EBITDA to below 4 turns by the end of 2017.
Slide 17. In conclusion, we are very happy to see that our business achieved strong year-over-year growth in 2015. We feel very confident about 2016.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Chanel to begin Q&A. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Unknown Speaker
Yes. Hi. This is actually Mike (20:05), going in for Gregg this morning. I was just wondering how many subscribers did Constant Contact have as of December 31?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Hey, how is it going? So with Constant Contact, based on how they define their subscribers, so it's over 600,000 subscribers. As we get that forwarded to our platform and look to see what fits our definition, et cetera, we anticipate that being north of half a million. But when we report on a consolidated basis this quarter, we'll have some insights into that.
Unknown Speaker
Okay, great. And just one more. I know a few months ago in limited testing, you guys were driving about 5% of Constant Contact's net ads by virtue of your partnership with them. Can you say how that's been tracking since then?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's been doing quite well. Off the size of the current funnel, it's anywhere between 7% and 10% of the sign-ups that are coming through us. And now that the deal is closed, the teams are working very closely together to be able to increase that and drive further volume into the Constant Contact funnel, off our existing funnel and off our existing base of customers as well.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Marc a question for you. I guess with the combination of Constant Contact, given the profile that you just kind of highlighted with the reduction in debt target by the end of fiscal 2017, with the addition of Constant Contact to the platform as well, how might your M&A appetite change versus how Endurance has run its acquisition strategy historically? What will you be focusing on? And will you be perhaps taking a pause from M&A or managing it a little bit differently? Maybe a little bit of color there would help.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. This is Hari. So, from an M&A standpoint, obviously we've just completed this sizeable transaction. It's a big team. We have a lot of work still in front of us cut out for getting the integration done, realizing the synergies and the costs on the revenue side. Our bar for M&A is probably significantly higher than it ever has been in the past. We've always been very judicious about capital deployment and looking at return on invested capital, IRRs, and present value of acquisitions as we have done them in the past.
But given the fact that there is significant opportunity within our current asset base, and given the opportunities for further refining those, I would say over the next four to six quarters, from an M&A standpoint, the bar is quite a bit higher, with the focus more on debt pay down for the business to get the leverage down as Marc noted in his remarks.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And maybe just to clarify, what will we have going forward for Constant Contact with regard to metrics that will help us fine-tune our models? Will we have subscribers and ARPU and maybe costs associated with them? Or how do you plan to manage those metrics going forward?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Obviously, sort of as integration goes forward, it's always difficult on the cost side to be able to break things out because we run it as one business. But we – similar to Directi, which was the last kind of meaningful acquisition we've done where we've broken out the revenue by quarter for Directi, we would certainly be doing that for Constant Contact for the next four quarters. And again, from the synergies and the synergy realization, we plan on talking to folks about that every quarter and giving people an update as we go along.
Beyond that, we're still assessing metrics and trying to figure out what really represents the combined company and the profile of the combined company because it has changed fairly dramatically from the last few years, and hope to come back with a view on what it is that we'd be providing to folks in the first quarter earnings call.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. Had mute technical issues there. So to start, I think the free cash flow was a bit – the guidance for this year is a bit better than we were looking for. And I want to say thank you for focusing on kind of a clean free cash flow. Also, I think Constant Contact guidance is pretty much in line with synergies. However, it does look like the core Endurance margin is going to be a bit lower than we were looking for, and I think in your prepared remarks you talked about more aggressive marketing.
What are you seeing that makes you, effectively – that's a change, I guess, from kind of, I guess – I don't know – let us know if you think that that would change versus when you last talked about the business pre-Constant Contact, and if there's a way to help us understand why you're confident that that is marketing well spent.

Second question, any update on the SEC inquiry? If nothing, that's fine. Just want to ask that. And then lastly, is there a way to talk about the impact of promotional pricing, if you have any data on what you're seeing like on second year ARPS renewals and the kind of the pricing trends there? Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Happy to, Jason. I think from our standpoint, we had talked over the course of last year, especially in the second half of the year with the launch of a lot of additional new product gateways, testing on marketing we had been ramping into this year. We feel quite good about the yields we're getting on a lot of these marketing spends. And as we noted in the prepared remarks, we will be spending significantly more in program marketing this year as compared to last year, even without the Constant Contact as a marketing spend addition.
We've been looking at the subscriber acquisition costs against the customer lifetime value. Those have all been looking good. So we feel very comfortable increasing the spend because we believe that it helps both top line and bottom line growth this year and compounds even more so going into next year and the years after. So it is dollars well spent.
Obviously, as we noted, the increase in revenue year-over-year is not inclusive of any M&A. So, all of the growth in the business is coming without any new incremental M&A. A part of that being reflected by the fact that we are accelerating marketing spend, and we feel good about that.
Taking your third question. Also at this point, in terms of renewal dollars, we're certainly seeing the same trend that we've talked about in the past, which is after the first year of intro pricing as people come up for renewal, the revenue per user does go up for those folks because they're as baked in pricing that they renew at higher pricing on the back end. And that trend has been very consistent. And obviously on the SEC inquiry matter, we are working with the SEC, giving them what it is that they need and that's really all we have in terms of an update at this point in time.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. We wanted to ask around the macro environment. Have you seen any impacts there, any meaningful change to churn with your current subs, any reluctance to purchase upgrades or additional products? Has the sales cycle lengthened at all?
And then second question, we think the Kabbage relationship is very interesting. Is that exclusive or are there other SMB finance relationships you can add there? Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So in terms of the macro climate, obviously we're feeling very bullish about the business based on the guidance we provided. Again, that didn't include any M&A in the future-looking guide for this year, so things are robust as we sit here today. Certainly, in terms of the growth itself, as Marc noticed, we are still indexing almost all, if not more than the rates we've provided towards subscriber additions.
We are still not particularly focused on the average revenue per sub, that's more an output for our business. As long as customers come in, they're high quality and the churn rates are in line and they buy additional products and services from us, and over time ARPS will become something that has a more normalized pattern. So we will continue to index towards net subscriber growth indicative of the fact that there really hasn't been much macro impact to the business to-date.
In terms of the Kabbage relationship, we've had that now for about two months. Actually, very positive feedback from our customers. Lots of folks originating working capital lines through the Kabbage partnership, and capital obviously is a big pain point for small and medium-sized businesses and access to capital. So as we've looked at that, we are certainly now considering other potential financial products that could be relevant to SMBs. We think that's an interesting area that provides some good value for our customer base.

Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks, Hari.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mitch Bartlett of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Interested in kind of growth assumptions, Constant Contact's, Endurance. You talked about low- to mid-single digits for Constant Contact, and I'm just wondering, given the advantage that you have with the ability to cross-sell and new distribution channels aimed at Constant Contact, why so slow a growth? And then I know this is the bane of your existence trying to parse out organic growth on the Endurance side against all the acquisitions, but if I put 4% growth on Constant Contact, I get Endurance growth of around 13% or numbers. What would be the organic number there?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. On the first question in terms of why we are talking about low- to mid-single-digit growth for Constant Contact, it's primarily because it's a big acquisition. We are in the middle of reorganizing the entire company and getting the teams lined up. Ron has been working hard with Harp to try to get the teams coordinated. As folks may recall, the year after we did the HostGator acquisition, it's pretty normal for us to try to take back marketing spend somewhat until the integration is fully done. We're still testing a lot of product gateways that could line up well for Constant Contact customers.
So what we don't like to do is overspend in that window of time, both from a marketing standpoint until we know where the best yields are. So we're very disciplined about how we think about spending in shorter windows, trying to optimize for longer periods of time. Certainly, we see upside in being able to cross-sell products and services. Those are not necessarily baked into our guidance at this point, and we just want to take some time to make sure the teams are lined up, the costs are in line. And as we did with HostGator, after that acquisition was done, we were able to accelerate marketing the year after. And that's not very dissimilar to our typical playbook as we go through a large acquisition. So that is reflective.
And I think your backing in math for Endurance of about 13%. That does sound right, Mitch. I think that's exactly where it shakes out. And as we noticed, the only sort of inorganic element in that 13% growth would be the full-year contribution of the smaller M&A items we did last year. It does not include any new M&A in that number. We've done a few of the smaller tuck-under hosting asset acquisitions last year over the course of the year, which included Arvixe and Site5 and Verio and IX. So we would have the full-year contribution of that this year. But besides that, everything else would be just growth from the business.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Just as a follow-on on the growth question for Constant Contact. After you take this step back, though, long term it seemed like you could materially affect the economics of that business on customer acquisition and return on that. Do you still believe that? And could you give us a venture? They use to spend over $600 to get a customer. What might it be in the future?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I think it would be speculative at this point. But from our standpoint, we do see that once we're able to get the acquisition model to be much more Web-acquisition focused where about 90% of the sales for Constant Contact now comes with hand holding for the customer, with phone calls to convert people from trial to pay-ups. The more we convert that to more of a Web-acquisition model, this SAC start to come down obviously because it's more self service and the cost to operate that is lower.

There is good opportunity to be able to upsell additional products and services into the base of Constant Contact customers, and again Constant Contact products into the base of Endurance customers. We're starting to experiment with a free-to-paid model, a freemium type of a model with alternative brands. So a lot in the works. And we do think that if some of these hit, there is some really good potential upside there in this business.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Sounds great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay, thanks. So Hari, I'm trying to get a sense of how much downward pressure there will be on your total report at ARPS as you bring on lower price point new subscribers. Are you able to say where the typical entry level of new subscriber is coming in and what that was a year-ago? And as you look to acquire more subscribers, should we be anticipating continuous sort of downward pressure there on the entry price?
And I guess sort of directionally following up on the earlier question, versus the SMBs who were already on Endurance, how do the size or the type of businesses compare at Constant Contact? And at this point, are you able to tell how receptive this newly acquired cohort will be for your more high-value add products? Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, Steven. So on the first question, obviously, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we added 550,000 – our base of subscribers increased by about 550,000 in 2015. The ARPS went down to about $14.29 or so from $14.40-ish range the prior year.
Introductory pricing still has been fairly consistent year-over-year, but as volume of customers go up, certainly that puts pressure on the average revenue per subscriber side. There are new gateways we're investing behind, so we feel that there are some gateways that actually are at much higher introductory pricing than our existing brands. But we do believe in the indexing towards subscriber strategy because we do consistently see that, over time, subscribers that stay with us pay more and engage with the higher-priced products and services. So that strategy still makes sense to us, and that is something we look at fairly carefully as well.
In terms of Constant Contact and what the profile of the customer there is. Still a majority of the customers there are sub-10 employees, very similar to the Endurance base of customers. They probably skew slightly bigger. If the Endurance average number of employees is four to five employees, they may be closer to six to seven employees. There's a slightly higher indexing towards non-profits in the Constant Contact base as well, but we do believe that across the spectrum, both having a lightweight version of the Constant Contact product within the existing Endurance space at prices that make sense for our kind of customers, and incremental products that we have within the product portfolio of Endurance being offered to the Constant Contact customer base has some good potential upside, none of which we've actually baked into our forecast currently in our guidance.
Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Two questions, guys. So first, after the close of Constant Contact acquisition, you're likely generating close to $250 million in unlevered free cash flow over the next few years. So is the priority to reduce leverage? And what do you see is the comfortable level where you want to hold leverage? And then I have another follow-up related to the core business.

Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I think, Deepak, from an unlevered free cash flow, that number would be probably slightly higher as we kind of work our way into it. I think from our standpoint, given that leverage now is around 5.3 turns, as Marc mentioned, our hope is to get that to 4 turns or lower by end of 2017. So uses of free cash flow primarily towards debt pay down, we would obviously look at opportunistic M&A. and if there's a deal that's too good to pass on, we will consider that, but the bar will be much higher.
So between the combination of growth and EBITDA, and opportunistic pay down of debt, we believe that we can bring that leverage level to below 4 turns by end of next year, and that's the current perspective from the company.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then from a product standpoint, last quarter you mentioned that certain launches were delayed into fourth quarter and then you expect to realize benefits of that in fiscal year 2016. I think products such as WordPress manager (38:25) WordPress hosting. So can you discuss on the progress there and how it tracked during fourth quarter, and what was assumed into the fiscal year 2016 guidance?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So there's a multiple things that we have been working on. We've launched a series of products around resume and resume management for customers. The cloud product launch, that did quite well. Q4 turned it up quite nicely as compared to Q3, and that trend continues on to this year. And I think as we had kind of anticipated, once the products were out the door, the compounding would start happening and that the take rates would be good.
That's exactly what we're seeing. And if you notice the earlier question from Gregg (sic) [Mitch] (39:07) was around what the assumptions are in the business. If you assume 4% or so as he did for Constant Contact growth, which is 13% growth for the Endurance core, hardly very much of that coming from a full-year contribution of M&A, most of that just coming from the core business. So we feel good about the products that came out the door, and that there are several more that are underway and to be launched soon.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. If I can ask one more. So the net subs adds was strong even after excluding kind of the asset consolidation that you did. Was there anything specific that you call out? I mean, 4Q is usually the seasonally slow quarter, but the adds were somewhat in line with what we've seen in the first quarter and much better than the third quarter. So is kind of like the current run rate the right way to think about the quarterly net adds that you would be targeting for the quarter?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it may be even a little north of that, Deepak, because if you looked at the guides we provided, we say kind of ARPS is flat to slightly down year-over-year for fiscal 2016, which means that all of the growth is coming from the net subscriber addition. So our anticipation is that it will be north of last year's net subscriber addition for the full year this year. And we also mentioned that we're meaningfully increasing marketing spend going into this year, which, obviously, translates to significant subscriber addition growth.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Hari.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Deepak.

Thank you very much. And our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Thank you. This is actually Priya Parasuraman for Gray. So can you talk about the competitive environment that you're seeing? And do you think you will still be active in the M&A market in 2016? And what kind of valuations are you seeing in the private market?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sorry. Priya, can you repeat the first part of that question? That was – it got a little choppy.
Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just the competitive environment. Any changes, especially with some of the M&A activities that other players in the market have undertaken recently?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Sort of from the competitive landscape standpoint, as we enter additional markets – so for example, now that WZ UK has been consolidated into our platform, we're very active in the Web builder space. There are obviously different players there than in the hosting space, in other tangential spaces that we look at like security solutions or resume building. There are other players there.
So we certainly sort of – from that perspective, the landscape has broadened both in terms of the kind of products and customers that we're onboarding and the competitive players in those segments are different than hosting. Some of them a little more competitive, some of them a little less competitive depending on what the gateway product is.
Certainly, in terms of the M&A element, we are setting a very high bar for M&A over the next four to six quarters. We would need to be convinced that something is, say, better use of our time and capital versus focusing on the substance of business we have and the subsequent amount of work we have to get done to get the integration completed and realizing synergies.
Certainly from a private market transaction standpoint, the ones we have done to-date with that same framework as we've always talked about, which is 10 to 12 times EBITDA and net of synergies. Maybe it's mid- to high-single digits, depending on the particular transaction. We are not seeing that changing. It's more a focus for ourself to work on the significant task ahead of us and also de-levering the company, which is what we told the markets, which is as long as there is an opportunistic M&A acquisition, we are fine levering up.
But as we did between 2013 and 2015 since we went public, we would then work on de-levering the business back to sub-4 turns.
Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Angela White, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Angela White - Director-Investor Relations
Hi, Toria. Thank you. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. First, we'll go through some prepared remarks, after which, we'll turn to Q&A. We've prepared a presentation to accompany our comments, which is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.endurance.com. While not necessary to follow along, we recommend referencing the presentation slides alongside our prepared remarks.
As is customary, let me now read the Safe Harbor statement. Statements made on today's call will include forward-looking statements about Endurance's future expectations, plans and prospects. All such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary language in today's earnings release and the announcement of the Constant Contact acquisition, and to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 7, 2015 for discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Endurance does not assume any obligations to update any forward-looking statements.
This communication is being made in respect of the proposed transaction involving Constant Contact and Endurance. A special stockholder meeting will be announced to obtain stockholder approval in connection with the proposed merger between Constant Contact and Endurance. Constant Contact expects to file with the SEC a proxy statement and other relevant documents in connection with the proposed merger. The definitive proxy statement will be sent or given to the shareholders of Constant Contact and will contain important information about the proposed transaction and related matters.
Investors of Constant Contact are urged to read the definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials carefully and in their entirety when they become available because they will contain important information about Constant Contact, Endurance and the proposed merger. Investors may obtain a free copy of these materials when they're available and other documents filed by Constant Contact with the SEC at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, at Constant Contact's website at www.constantcontact.com or by sending a written request at Constant Contact at 1601 Trapelo Road, Waltham, Mass. 02451, Attention: Investor Relations.
Constant Contact, Endurance, and their respective directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in soliciting proxies from Constant Contact's stockholders in connection with the proposed merger. Information regarding Constant Contact's and Endurance's directors and executive officers is set forth in their respective definitive proxy statements for their respective 2015 annual meetings with stockholders and their respective most recent annual reports on Form 10-K.

Information regarding other persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be considered to be participants in the solicitation of Constant Contact's stockholders in connection with the proposed merger will be set forth in Constant Contact's definitive proxy statement for its special stockholder meeting. Additional information regarding these individuals and Constant Contact's and Endurance's respective directors and executive officers and any direct or indirect interests they may have in the proposed merger will be set forth in the definitive proxy statement when and if it is filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed merger.
During this call, we'll present several non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, unlevered free cash flow as reported, free cash flow, adjusted revenue, and average revenue per subscriber. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the presentation located in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With that, I'll turn you over to Hari Ravichandran, our Founder, President and CEO.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Angela. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Before providing commentary in Q3, I'd like to discuss the Constant Contact transactions that we announced this morning concurrent with earnings release. We're very excited about the transaction, the company, its offerings and how it fits with Endurance.
Strategically, this acquisition combines two companies focused on helping SMBs grow and succeed via online services and products. We share much in common such as our technology capabilities and our enthusiasm for small business to success. But we also see an opportunity to bring together our different competencies.
As some of you know, Constant Contact is a leading online marketing platform targeted at helping SMBs and nonprofits grow their enterprises through a suite of products such as e-mail marketing campaigns, event management and contact management. We, at Endurance, have historically focused on other SMB online services primarily through our Web presence solutions.
Typically, once SMBs are set up and running, key on their list of priorities is growing their business. In order to address these needs, over the years, we've expanded our offerings and provided tools such as security, back-up and e-commerce solutions but have done so primarily by means of partner offers through our distribution platform. With this transaction, we see continued opportunity to expand our position as a provider of complete end-to-end Web presence and marketing solutions for SMBs.
Endurance's 4.5 million subscribers on platform will now have access to a full suite of Constant Contact products and other services. Outside of Endurance space, Constant Contact will have access to our healthy subscriber acquisition funnel and capabilities in marketing to SMBs, thereby enhancing their subscriber acquisition economics.
We also believe that Endurance's experience promoting multiple brands targeted at specific SMB segments positions us well to potentially provide further adaptations of Constant Contact products through alternative brands while continuing to offer the higher engagement products Constant Contact currently offers.
The transaction also benefits us through scale, both operationally and financially. We expect that this will come from leveraging the fixed costs, the sharing of talent and technology and product, and the reduction of redundant costs, which Marc will discuss in his section. Additionally, as our scale continues to build, we believe we'll be able to leverage our position in technology, marketing channels and product to support longer-term growth and value creation for our subscribers.

The transaction is expected to bring Endurance to over $1 billion of estimated combined pro forma 2015 adjusted revenue and approximately $350 million of estimated pro forma 2015 adjusted EBITDA. On a combined pro forma basis for fiscal 2016, we expect our adjusted revenue to grow at low-double digits year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA to reach approximately $400 million. This positions us ahead of our original pace in our journey to reaching our longer-term adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow goals.
In addition to scale, we're excited that the Constant Contact team will be joining us and bringing complementary focus and capabilities in areas that we see as an extension of Endurance's competencies. We've historically focused more on our marketing network and distribution platform and, to a lesser degree, on product development.
Constant Contact is focused more on product and specifically on user experience, robust subscriber analytics, and engagement models. Their extraordinary understanding of the SMB market is a result of focus in investment and understanding the needs and addressing the problems in SMB space as they build their businesses.
We believe that the addition of these capabilities to our strong foundation will enhance our standing as a leader in online SMB services as we have expanded beyond Web presence to a full suite of products and services that are essential for SMBs in their journey to success.
While we believe the transaction will create many opportunities for future benefit, we've already seen many positives coming from our existing partnership with Constant Contact. We've known each other for many years and have partnered on different programs. We're excited by the cross-sell opportunities associated with adding Constant Contact's products and feel very comfortable that there is a considerable appetite within our subscriber base for their suite of products.
As a result of a program we launched earlier this year, we're now driving approximately 5% of Constant Contact's new unique customer additions. Further, after initial analysis, we're excited about the strong recurring revenue and high retention rates of the subscribers using the Constant Contact product.
To slide 6. Turning for a moment to our historic acquisitions and our track record, Endurance has completed over 40 acquisitions of varying sizes and strategic purposes since we started the business, and we believe that M&A is one of our core competencies. Constant Contact will continue to operate at its own distinct brand and join other brands in the Endurance portfolio that serve the large fragmented SMB online services market.
We believe that our approach to operating a portfolio of brands under one umbrella facilitates a united framework for management of operations, creating scale efficiencies in the organization. Regardless of whether an acquisition skews more towards a growth profile or a cash flow profile, we have been able to achieve improved efficiencies as we integrate their operations into the existing Endurance technology and distribution platform.
Now, to details of the transaction. We signed the definitive agreement for the purchase of outstanding Constant Contact shares of $32 per share in an all-cash transaction. With approximately 32 million shares outstanding, the total transaction is valued at $1.1 billion. The valuation translates into approximately 12 times estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA, including cash on their balance sheet at closing and before factoring in synergies. Assuming annualized run rate synergies in addition, the multiple is closer to seven times estimated 2015 adjusted EBITDA.
In 2015, we expect the combined pro forma adjusted revenue of approximately $1.1 billion and combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA of approximately $350 million. We expect cost savings of approximately $55 million by the end of year one on a run rate basis.

For 2016, on a combined pro forma basis, we expect 10% to 12% year-over-year growth in adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $400 million. This transaction is expected to generate double-digit accretion to free cash flow.
Financing for the transaction has been fully committed. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 contingent upon approval from Constant Contact shareholders, antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is also subject to a go-shop period that ends on November 21, 2015.
When we think about the SMB online services space and Endurance's place in the landscape, we believe that our low-cost subscriber on-boarding funnel sets us apart, leveraging our strong word of mouth and partner network to drive subscribers onto multiple brands supporting multiple product segments.
Once on our platform, we drive value with these subscribers via multiple touch points to provide them a more comprehensive Web presence solution. Over the years, every aspect of this strategy has expanded as you can see in slide 8.
As these SMBs grow their business, they look for tools and services that help them meet their goals. Constant Contact has been a leading online marketing platform that focuses on helping SMBs and non-profits grow with a suite of products and services aimed at helping their customers reach their growth and marketing goals.
The company was founded in 1995, went public in 2007 and has continued to be a category leader in SMB online marketing services. We believe that Constant Contact's core product still has less than 30% penetration in our target SMB market and still has significant room to grow.
In addition to e-mail marketing, the company has added other tools to its suite including surveys, event management, contact management and reporting. Again, we're very excited to bring their talent and capabilities to our portfolio of brands and excited at the prospect of offering our subscribers a more comprehensive suite of solutions that addresses the wide range of their online marketing needs.
Our focus on Web presence space has allowed us to grow the business and realize the scale benefits that come with a growing base of millions of subscribers and addressing their expanding needs. The acquisition of Constant Contact allows us to build on this model, providing both our subscribers and theirs with access to a full suite of products and services, and creating future opportunities for cross-sell over the lifetime of a subscriber. We believe that with the addition of these important tools for SMBs, we have a long runway to provide additional value.
Slide 11. Turning now to the Endurance business, we delivered a solid quarter with results that were within our range of expectations, which Marc will review in more detail in his section. In addition to the Constant Contact acquisition, we continue to focus on core business initiatives and expanding the gateways to our platform through products and services other than traditional hosting. We see positive indicators in our SiteBuilder joint venture, and other products such as security solutions.
Internationally, we continue to increase efforts and have invested in building out our teams to support Brazil on our recent Mexico site launch. Third quarter GAAP revenue in the international business was 38%, similar to Q3 of last fiscal year. Our current marketing partnership with Constant Contact continued to perform well. Also on the M&A front, during the quarter, we acquired a data center in Provo, Utah, which we believe will allow us to better align our technology operations and data center support.
Over time, as we complete the integration of the data center, we expect to see approximately $7 million of annualized savings. We feel confident that the investments we've been making in these core business initiatives will drive growth in fiscal 2016. We had expected some of these initiatives would bear results in the fiscal year. However, full launch of some products such as cloud hosting and Optimized WordPress have been delayed into the later part of the fiscal year and corresponding compounding of revenue will be pushed into 2016.

During Q3, we took further steps to form a more agile organization, which we believe will drive better decision-making and cost-efficiencies as the business evolves. As a result of these changes, we had higher-than-usual restructuring expenses in Q3. We feel very confident on our position to drive healthy growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2016 on a stand-alone basis.
Despite all the moving pieces during the quarter, we're very pleased of the results and the continued work of our teams in order to support our place as a leader in SMB online services space. We're excited about accelerating our journey to reaching our longer-term goals and driving long-term shareholder value.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Marc Montagner, our CFO.
Marc Montagner - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Hari. On slide 13, first of all, I am very pleased to report that in the third quarter, both adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 15% year-over-year and came within our range of expectation. Adjusted revenue was $190.3 million reflecting year-over-year growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITDA was $66.6 million also reflecting year-over-year growth of 15%. Unlevered free cash flow, as reported, was $51.2 million and free cash flow was $27.9 million. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by integration, restructuring, transaction and legal-related expenses of approximately $9.4 million.
Foreign currency fluctuation have also impacted our results over the last quarter. Excluding impact of year-over-year currency exchange rates, adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA would have been higher by approximately $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
Slide 14. Looking at the result on a year-to-date basis for the nine months ending September 30, 2015, adjusted revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $552.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year to $195.7 million. Unlevered free cash flow, as reported, grew 16% year-over-year to $166.5 million. And free cash flow grew 29% year-over-year to $107.7 million.
Slide 15 now. Turning to operating metrics, we increased net subscriber by over 87,000 in the third quarter, bringing total subscribers on our platform to approximately 4.5 million subs. Average revenue per subscriber, ARPS, was $14.29. On a year-to-year basis – year-to-date basis, ARPS was $14.36 versus $14.35 for the same period a year-ago.
Slide 16. Turning to other metrics, I would like to mention that we are not showing three performance metric this quarter: monthly recurring revenue or MRR, number of product per subs, PPS, and the number of subscribers paying us over $500 per year. We recently identified an error while migrating some data from our legacy business intelligence system to an upgraded BI system, which impacted these metrics. We're on the process of recalculating these numbers. This system is completely separate from the ERP system that produces our financial and subscriber data. We believe that our previously reported MRR numbers will remain at 99% for at least the last four quarters.
Revised numbers for both the number of product per subs and number of $500-plus subs are expected to be lower than the previously reported numbers. This does not impact our GAAP financial result, adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, or unlevered free cash flow metrics. This also does not impact ARPS subscriber count, churn, unit economics. We will provide update in metric information as soon as it is available.
The purpose of the PPS and the $500-plus metrics was to provide additional insights to element that can directly impact ARPS. Here, on this slide, we show you on a more granular level our customer spending on our platform evolves over time. We are providing two views: on the top, one for current active subscribers and one for subscriber over time on the bottom. The chart on the bottom factors in the impact of churn. Typically, a new sub will come to our platform at a lower introductory price for the first term, which is typically 12 months. Coming out of introductory pricing and cross-selling of additional products drive monthly spend higher over time. Driving subscriber unit growth puts downward pressure on average monthly spend because of the lower introductory pricing in the first year.

However, we drive significant value from new subs as they increase their spending with us over time. As a result, we tend to index more towards subscriber growth, which provide opportunities to generate additional revenues and free cash flow over the long term.
Slide 17. Now that we have reviewed the third quarter results, let's turn to guidance for the remainder of the year. Starting with adjusted revenue with one quarter left in the fiscal year, we're narrowing our 2015 guidance range and expect adjusted revenue in the range of $745 million to $750 million or 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range.
Adjusted EBITDA expectations for the full year are now $265 million to $270 million, reflecting 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. Full year 2015 expectation for unlevered free cash flow, as reported, remain unchanged at approximately $220 million to $230 million, reflecting 16% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $142 million, reflecting growth of 23% year-over-year.
Slide 16 (sic) [18] (21:14), turning to fiscal 2016 guidance, we expect that our fiscal 2015 investment, as well as our disciplined view on capital deployment, whether we are reinvesting in the business or through M&A, will continue to build value for our shareholders. For 2016, we want to focus on free cash flow generation and disciplined top-line growth.
First, on a stand-alone basis, our expectation for fiscal year 2016 are as follows: adjusted annual revenue year-over-year growth of approximately 11% to 13%, annual adjusted EBITDA year-over-year growth of approximately 11% to 13%, CapEx of approximately 5% of adjusted revenue, and a free cash flow year-over-year growth of approximately 15% to 20%.
When taking into consideration the impact of the acquisition of Constant Contact, our guidance for fiscal 2016 on a combined pro forma basis is the following: adjusted annual revenue year-over-year growth of approximately 10% to 12%, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $400 million for the full year including realized synergies, and CapEx of approximately 5% of combined adjusted revenues.
On a combined basis, pro forma run rate synergies of approximately $55 million will result in adjusted EBITDA margins of 35% or more. Also, including cost to achieve synergies, the transaction is expected to drive double-digit accretion to free cash flows in fiscal 2016.
We feel extremely confident about delivering at least $55 million of cost synergies on an annual run rate basis. These synergies have been built on a bottom-up approach, and we believe that they were very achievable. Our plan is to realize at least $25 million of cost synergies in fiscal 2016. Additional revenue synergies or cross-selling opportunities are not factored into these synergy numbers.
Slide 19. We plan to finance the Constant Contact transactions to an incremental $1.085 billion in debt, $735 million in an incremental term loan and $350 million in high-yield debt at a fixed rate. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are providing debt financing on a fully committed basis.
Additionally, as part of this transaction, we anticipate expanding the maturity of our existing term loan. Next year, fiscal 2016, we expect combined pro forma adjusted EBITDA of approximately $400 million for the full year, including realized synergies of $25 million. These translate into leverage of 4.3 turns on a secured basis and 5.2 turns on an unsecured basis. We plan on exiting 2016 with a run rate of synergies of $55 million and having pro forma adjusted EBITDA of approximately $430 million for the full year 2016. This will take our leverage down by almost half a turn by the end of 2016.
Slide 20. In conclusion, we are very pleased to see that are our business achieved a 15% year-over-year growth rate in the last quarter, and we feel very confident about fiscal 2016. Finally, we expect our business to drive significant adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth for the next few years. We feel very confident that the existing opportunities in our core business, combined with M&A, will accelerate delivery of our long-term financial goal.

Now, I'd like to turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could maybe address a little bit more color around how we might expect ARPU to trend over the next couple of quarters and maybe what's embedded in your guidance. I understand you have some introductory pricing that may be skewing it a little bit. So, just want to get a better understanding how long you might expect that to persist and maybe how that might act independent of the acquisition over time. And then I have a quick follow-up.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, thanks for the question, Brian. As you noticed in the transcript, we talked about sort of year-to-date ARPU numbers and that being about $0.01 or so higher than the same period for last year. So, obviously, looking at it in any given quarter makes it skew up and down. But our current plan is really the way we run the business is think about revenue, revenue growth, what the right products are for our customers, what do we need to add to make sure we drive value for the customers, and primarily keep indexing towards more subs as long as the lifetime value over the cost of acquiring the customer, those economics make sense to us in terms of returns.
So, I think that you could probably ask us most metrics about the business and we'd know them pretty well, pretty rapidly. But ARPU is one that typically tends to be an output for our business versus an input. We don't drive the business for ARPU, we drive it for subscriber growth. That's part of the reason why we wanted to put that slide out there today which shows that recurring trend of customers starting at a lower price point, whether they're active customers or customers that have stayed for us with for a time and canceled, both those data sets, you see the very compelling trajectory as they go from a lower price point to north of $20 for the active customer. So, when you know you've got those kinds of economics, it makes rational business sense for us to keep indexing towards higher subs.
So, thinking about ARPU being flat or in the kind of same trajectory we've had it is probably okay as long as we're getting the growth from good, high quality customers where subscriber acquisition cost is reasonable and the unit economics hold, we will continue to keep skewing towards that because that makes the best sense for long term.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. That's – cohort analysis is very helpful, so thank you for that. And then on the Constant Contact side, maybe just a quick comment in terms of how long you've been speaking with the company and was it a competitive process, and will you give us the visibility that they've given their investors historically over customer growth, churn and ARPU growth?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, the metrics, we're still kind of working our way into what makes sense for the combined business going into next year, Brian, but obviously on a simple pro forma basis we just took their total revenues, our revenues plus their subs plus ours, our ARPU would go up quite a bit. But from our standpoint, the way we tend to look at the business is once Constant Contact is integrated onto our platform and the teams are working closely together, we would look at growth from all of our different gateways and the Constant Contact product or perhaps some additional variations of the Constant Contact brand as we talked about on the transcript would end up becoming one gateway of many that we would be looking to spend marketing dollars on.

And we'd want to look at yields on marketing because it becomes a capital deployment decision as to what we're spending on that gateway, what the lifetime value of the customer looks like, what does churn look like, what kind of products are they buying incremental and what the cash-on-cash returns look like for that kind of a sub versus a traditional web presence sub. And that would drive a lot of the decision-making because, from our standpoint, we have a lot of tools and a lot of areas to put marketing dollars to work to, and this becomes an incremental one. But as always, we would aspire to make sure that the market is aware of how we're thinking about this, what the right metrics are to be able gauge it, and we hope to come back with something fairly thoughtful next year that would give you guys some comfort.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Oh, I'm sorry. And, Brian, on the how long have we been speaking.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We have – we've known Constant Contact...
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I know they're right down the street.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Exactly. So, we've known them since the late 1990s from when they were Roving Software. So, we've known the company for a long time. And this part of the negotiation has been going on from the beginning part of this year, maybe late last year. So, working with Morgan Stanley who's represented them on the sell side.
Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you very much and good morning to everyone. Hari, based on what you disclosed, it seems that you're expecting over $50 million in EBITDA synergies, which is a fairly large number. That's just based on, I guess, the sort of the multiple of Constant Contact and where you think that goes to post synergies.
I know you said cost savings should be $55 million by end of year one on a run rate basis. I think Marc also said you should realize at least $25 million of cost synergies in the full year of 2016. So, if I'm not mistaken, there is a fairly meaningful revenue synergy that is being baked into the model. So, any additional color that you could provide on how you get there both on the top line and through cost would be helpful. Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, just to clarify, Gregg, the $55 million number, as we kind of mentioned in the transcript, does not include any cross-selling or revenue synergies, that's primarily anticipated to be on just the cost-saving side. If you think about the levers for cost saving, obviously, there are multiple ones. There are overlap costs, obviously, as two public companies. There is basically, perhaps, some overlap cost on sort of the way the teams are organized, et cetera, what the platform on a combined basis looks like.
We do have a large marketing funnel that provides some potential there as well in terms of being able to drive, as we mentioned in the transcript, just for the last few months or so through the partnership, we're driving about 5% of the gross sign-ups into Constant Contact now. To us, that's obviously incrementally zero dollars of marketing spend because those are customers already coming into our platform. And there's obviously facilities and data centers and things like that, that have some overlap as well.
So, the revenue and the cross-sell opportunities we think of as further upside. The $55 million we're talking about at the end of the year run rate and the $25 million of realized in 2016 are primarily from the cost side.

Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the clarification, Hari. And then, in the actual quarter itself, the net adds were a little bit lower than we were expecting. It was down modestly year-over-year. So, any additional color on that would be great. Thank you.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Happy to. So, I think on the net subscriber additions for this quarter, we had been working through launching multiple product gateways, particularly around cloud and WordPress and a few other sort of brands that needed to come out to market that were a little bit delayed as we held our marketing cost kind of constant to be able to kind of put the dollars behind it. They have now launched. And we anticipate kind of going into 2016, there will be a lot of marketing spend behind those gateways because the initial testing has been quite positive.
That had sort of a compounding impact both on adjusted revenues, the flow-through to EBITDA and on the net subscribers as well. So it's just – nothing is shifted dramatically in the business. It's just a time shift of some of the launches that have pushed off the sub and the associated revenue growth out into 2016.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. A couple quick questions. I think you mentioned on the call that you see getting a half-turn improvement in the leverage in 2016, still consistent with your long-term view and where you want the leverage of the business to be. And then if you could remind us on the Constant Contact side, any noticeable difference in terms of the characteristics of the SMBs, and we know you've been working or partnering with them for a while. Maybe any comments around the overlap of the customer bases. Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, I got the second part of the question, Brian. We had a little cross-noise here from something. Would you mind repeating the first part again?
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Yeah. So, the first part was just on the leverage. I think you said in 2016, it improves by a half turn, still consistent with your long-term view of where you want the leverage of the business to be.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No. So, as we've always been fairly explicit with both the analyst community and also with the investors, our midterm target around leverage was about 4-ish turns, and this obviously puts it a little bit higher. But we've also been pretty explicit that if there are good opportunities that we have a lot of conviction around, we don't mind increasing leverage for short spurts or short windows of time where it does spike up a bit.
This is one of those situations, the way we think about it. This is a significant asset with a lot of both the revenue and kind of cost upside to us and a very strategic product for our customer base. So, we think of this one as something where leverage going up a little bit doesn't particularly bother us, given how accretive this is to both free cash flow and to EBITDA over the course of next year.
So if you look at the numbers that Marc provided which was, on a realized basis, about $400 million of EBITDA for 2016 exiting the year, without the incremental growth into 2017 of $435 million which is the rest of synergies that you would not realized and – what you would have executed on but not yet realized until 2017, the leverage ratio has come down about a half turn of that exit value and then there's obviously additional growth that comes into 2017. So, we would think that, in the midterm, we'd want to kind of get back very quickly to that 4 turns or less of leverage and we feel pretty comfortable doing that.

And then on the difference in the types of SMBs, it's amazing the overlap of the customer base here is something that was very exciting to us. There's maybe a slightly larger indexing of non-profits in the Constant Contact base but the business, from a subscriber composition looks very, very similar to Endurance.
We'd known that going into the transaction given the partnership we've had and the amount of sign-ups we've been driving and how much opportunity and excitement there was within our own customer base. But this fits. It's a different product than some of the other M&A activities we've taken on, but it is something that we understand, we're very familiar with, the base is very, very similar to our own base. And we think that the game plan of how we're planning on going around to both realizing the synergies and driving more incremental value in the long term is very similar to some of the other M&A we've done in the past.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks, Hari.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hey. Thanks. Two questions. And first, congratulations on the deal. So, Hari, it does seem like there just overall has been some headwind to subscriber growth. Is there anything you're seeing out there from a competitive aspect that other companies are doing or that you're seeing change in customer behavior where you're kind of not hitting the numbers that you want to hit and you – part of this (37:49) is addressing this with greater functionality and kind of working on the product portfolio?
And then the second question, can you help us understand the organic outlook for next year? So, if you strip out Constant Contact, what does it imply for subscriber, ARPU, collections and EBITDA growth? Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. On the headwind side of it, I think some of the headwinds we've created is our own doing more than what see in the macro side. There's obviously been some, as we mentioned, delays in launching some products out the door where we're seeing pretty significant customer demand.
We've been a little bit slow getting out the gate on a few of these products and part of that kind of resulted in us sort of forming a much more agile organization over the course of Q3, as I mentioned in the transcript. So, with that in place, we're pretty comfortable that we will continue to keep launching the products we need to be able to capture demand which is part of our core strategy.
So, we don't particularly look at the market and say there is a lot of headwind because a competitive dynamic has set in more now than before. It's much more that we could be a little bit tighter and do a little bit better job that we plan on doing and have already started going down the path of. So, less concerns on that piece of it. We feel comfortable kind of going into 2016 and 2017 that with the investments we've made, we feel good about where things will come out.
Without the Constant Contact piece of it, we guided to adjusted revenues of 11% to 13% growth year-over-year which, implies about $830 million to $844 million of revenue growth at the low end and high end, that's again on a stand-alone basis. EBITDA, we guided to, ballpark, about $300 million without Constant Contact baked in. So, we feel good about sort of where the trajectory is on the on-ramp going into next year. And a lot of the work we've done, while it's been a little bit shifted, still feels like it bodes well going into next year, and we're feeling quite good about the prospects for 2016 at this point.
Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And then just a quick follow-up. When you think about the marketplace, any change in the way you think about long-term acquisition pipeline? Are there still large enough subscriber transactions out there? Is the market just feel like it's fragmented enough that you'd rather address it with a product suite as opposed to, historically, kind of subscriber acquisition thing (40:20)?

Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think in general, we still see quite a bit of fragmentation, quite a bit of players out there in the core hosting space. Obviously, as we enter other spaces like marketing and online marketing services that opens up other opportunity for other acquisitions in the future there as well, but we still feel like there's a lot of subs out there, both getting them directly by marketing into it, and also by acquiring both bases of customers and moving them to our platform. Both those opportunities feel intact with at this point.
And so – and I think one of the earlier questions you had, Jason, was about again, the subscriber versus ARPU growth. We still will keep indexing towards subs and that part of our strategy has not changed at all. We still feel good that that's the right way to think about it long term where – especially when you see those vintage cohort charts that we provided, I think it makes clear sense as to why one should index more that way if you can.
Jason S. Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thanks. So, Hari, has the $9 introductory pricing been fairly consistent throughout 2010 to 2015 or has that been trending down as well? And secondarily, what are you seeing the overall market on this introductory pricing as you think about your marketing yield? You can choose to advertise, I guess, to reduce introductory pricing. So, what is the preferred channel for you? Thanks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, on that chart, what you see is obviously the active customers that are currently on platform at about $11.23 and the subscribers over time that includes the cancellations at around $9 going up to $18. I would say, again, this is more anecdotally this is – I don't have the exact kind of data here, but my intuition here is that the introductory pricing started going down in the early 2000s, mid-2000s time period for the last four years or five years. It's been low, but it's been stable on the front end. What people were paying for hosting now gets split into both shared hosting and other additional products that they buy as well. So, the $9, my gut sense, would be that it's been pretty consistent without a lot of shift there.
And given the fact that from a subscriber acquisition cost standpoint, our model is purely success-based. When you look at the lifetime value of what's left over, there is pretty significant cash-on-cash returns on these subs. So, we still feel very good about our go-to-market model and we feel that, especially as you think about other areas that are outside of the U.S. as well, there's still quite a bit of opportunity there for subscriber addition.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gray Powell of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple, if I may. You may have touched on this in the prepared remarks, I just want to make sure I understand correctly. What kind of revenue synergies should we think about with the Constant Contact acquisition that you haven't already highlighted in terms of the $55 million year end 2016 run rate? And then also Constant Contact has a partnership with at least one of your direct competitors, do you see any risk to that portion of the business?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, as we mentioned, the $55 million, Gray, doesn't include any form of revenue synergies associated with that number. But from a sort anecdotal standpoint, some of the things that we think about and get excited about, I can just lay those out for you to consider. So, if you think about our current customer base, we've got 4.5 million customers on our platform. The thing that our customers ask us for over and over again that they're willing to spend dollars on is the opportunity for them to have tools that help them grow their business.

So, if you think about kind of integration of multiple things between their web presence and their marketing solutions, their email marketing solutions, there's a lot of overlap there where you could easily onboard customers into a Constant Contact-like product with their e-mail list already preloaded, that makes them very easy and friction-free for them to be able to launch their products and to be able to launch their marketing campaigns off the bat. When people are coming in through our existing funnel, we have opportunities to basically intersect that, and see if they would be interested in a more broader bundle of products that would be interesting to them.
Using our web builders and the templated products that we have, we could mirror the e-mail campaigns to look exactly like their website, so they have one unifying brand across all of their sort of online campaigns, whether their sort of e-mail based or web presence-based. And again, as we expand gateways, it provides further opportunities for us to get customers into the Constant Contact products a little bit cheaper.
If you don't think about sort of one brand, but if you think about a multi-brand strategy, you could experiment with other things like a freemium model or other sort of good market strategies in pricing, which is a little bit harder to do when you've got one kind of premier marquee brand that is going after a segment of customers. So, all in all, we think there's a lot of good opportunities on the revenue growth side, none of which has been baked into the numbers or the models we've provided you folks for 2016 at this point.
Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then just more of a housekeeping question, if I may. On the ARPS side, can you give us a sense as to what the impact of foreign exchange was on the metric year-over-year, and then also how should we just think about sort of the mix of domestic versus international customers influencing the metric?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I think in total, when we talk about the impact to revenue from foreign exchange, it was about $1 million or so for the quarter, $900,000 or so, and it flowed through into ARPS again. We don't have that calculation, but that was sort of the impact of currency on the total revenue for the quarter. In terms of the international portion of it, again, our international year-over-year total was still about 38% last Q3 and it's still 38% this year.
So, there's not been a meaningful impact there yet but, over time, obviously, the FX delta was primarily due to the real and our Brazil business. But over time, again, we tend to think about it as CLT meet the CAC (46:58). So to the degree that there's an impact on pricing in foreign markets, we'd want to make sure that the subscriber acquisition cost or the cost to acquire a customer is in line with that lower ARPU that we would be able to command in those markets, and the lifetime value ratios still hold.
Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Bartlett of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Sure. Hari, not to beat a dead horse, but you talked about in your script, you think you've penetrated – or Constant Contact has penetrated 30% of your targeted e-mail audience. So, would that be somewhere around 1.5 million folks that you're – if they have 650,000 customers and there's – I'm sure there's some slippage in that number – would you have a targeted e-mail audience within your subscriber base of well over 1 million?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

So, sorry, Mitch, that 30% number we were referring to was the macro market in terms of how many total customers...
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Oh, okay.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
...are using the e-mail marketing product. The penetration rate of Constant Contact into our base would be much smaller which, again, we've started deep levels of testing only over the last four months to five months, and the results have been really, really reinforcing that gave us a lot of conviction around this transaction.
So, we think that there is a significant portion of our customer base that is interested in e-mail marketing that don't have any service provided that they're currently using, and a lot of the difficulty always comes down to how easy and friction-free can you make it for these customers to be able to use the product. And some of things that are difficult for them are to create e-mail lists, for example, and be able to import them, to be able to create collateral or campaigns in an easy way. Given that we have their website and we already have all of the e-mails they're using with their business and the outbound e-mails are being sent out of our platform, we have some good opportunities to make that – make those barriers a little bit simpler as we get a more deeper integration, which would be a positive thing in terms of getting people to take this us up on the Constant Contact product.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Got it. Thank you. So, second question would just be on Webzai, that acquisition, the joint venture and the rollout of that product. Could you talk to that just a little bit more?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I'd be happy to. That thing's been going fantastically well. We couldn't be more excited about the momentum around that product. As folks know, that is not included in our numbers. So, when you think about net additions of subscribers in Q3 or revenue, the impact of that JV is not in there until at some point if the company decides to consolidate that and bring that onto our platform entirely.
But the ramp-up has been very good. It's still, as we mentioned during Investor Day, we're signing up over 15,000 customers or so, ballpark, on a pay-up (49:56) basis, on a monthly basis on the product. We're investing, with our partner, a good amount of marketing dollars behind that gateway. We feel that that's a great market and the ratios have held quite well. And I think at this point, we're probably getting up to about 230,000 to 250,000-plus free sites being set up on a monthly basis. So, it's been pretty good momentum there.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
And when do you anticipate bringing it onto your books?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Still under discussion with our partners and with the company internally, but our hope is some time in the near future.
Mitchell Palmer Bartlett - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC
Very good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan. Your line is now open.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, for the quarter itself, can you give us what the organic revenue growth was ex the acquisitions from late last year and this year? What was the contribution from acquisitions maybe on a dollar basis? And then qualitatively, can you discuss about the growth profile of some of your bigger brands? I have one follow-up on the product after this.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, Deepak. I think that probably closest thing you're going to find to that is what you see in the flux (51:07) analysis of the earnings materials, that there's sort of an increase of about $25-ish million. What you'll see is about – it's hard to break it out because sometimes the growth that comes from the acquisitions get ascribed into the bucket for acquisitions. But it's about a split of about $10 million, $15 million – I think $15 million from the acquisition kit and the other is from the core business. However, in that $15 million is also any revenue growth and revenue synergies in that same bucket as well. So, that's probably the closest we're able to break out.

And I think your question on the profile of growth for larger brands, I don't quite follow that. Can you maybe...?
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
No. I'm just trying – yeah, I was trying to get a sense about what the profile is like for Bluehost and HostGator, the bigger brands that you have, particularly now you have multiple pricing elements into it?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, that's – I think on the growth side of those brands, they continue to perform well. They're going after different segments of the marketplace. HostGator is still indexing much more towards customer service. Bluehost continue to index more towards the technology-focused customer base with a good partnership with WordPress. So, they're both continuing to perform well. And all of those would be loaded up into the split of numbers that I gave you that you'll find in our Q.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, one other question on the product side. You mentioned about the delay of offerings related to WordPress and the cloud-hosting into late this year. What were the factors that caused the delay? And then maybe how much of that have you factored into your FY 2016 guidance?
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. So, I think foundationally, it's basically as we get bigger and bigger, there is obviously sort of distributed teams, teams that work in different geographies, teams that work in different spots, and getting everybody aligned sometimes takes a little bit of a concerted effort. And I would say where we had some fillings (53:07) is that alignment between DevOps, SysOps, product and marketing.
Sometimes, as you get bigger and bigger, tend to go, even if it's slightly off-kilter then delivery of products end up slipping. So, what we've done is gone back and reorganized that portion of our business with very clear lines of organization into clear leadership with clear lines of accountability. So, we think that delivery will get better and faster. It already has. And so we feel confident in terms of the 2016 numbers because a lot of that is baked on things that we have a high degree of comfort or have already launched and we see the ramp into it, and certainly want to be cognizant of the fact we're accounting for any mistakes we've made not being factored into future guidance we're providing the market.
Deepak Mathivanan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Hari.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Deepak.
Operator
Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further participants in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Hari K. Ravichandran - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, everyone, for listening. We're excited about the Constant Contact acquisition, and we're very excited as we look towards the end of this year and into 2016. Lots of exciting things going on. And as we finish out the second-year anniversary of being a public company, we feel very good about our trajectory of going into next year with $400 million of EBITDA and continue to grow from there. Thank you for your time.
