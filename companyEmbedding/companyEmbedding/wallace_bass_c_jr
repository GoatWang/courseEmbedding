 Educational Background



BA in Economics 


University of Virginia

                  The University of Virginia (often abbreviated as UVA, UVa, or Virginia) is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was conceived and designed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and established in 1819. UVA's initial Board of Visitors included former Presidents of the United States Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. Monroe owned the initial site of the University, which was mostly farmland. His law office and farmhouse are now the site of Brown College at Monroe Hill, a residential college at UVA.

UVA is one of the eight original Public Ivy universities, and it is the only university campus in the United States that is designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In the 2013 edition of U.S. News and World Report's National University Rankings, the school was listed as America's 2nd best public university; tied with UCLA and surpassed only by UC Berkeley.

University of Texas at Austin - School of Law

                  The University of Texas School of Law began as the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Law when the University was founded in 1883. The Law School started with two professors and fifty-two students in the basement of the University's Old Main Building. The Law School has since grown to more than 1,200 students and offers the Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) and the Master of Laws (LLM). The School of Law is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and is approved by the American Bar Association.
