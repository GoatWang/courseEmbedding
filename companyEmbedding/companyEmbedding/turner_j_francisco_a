There's a lot that you have to do each day. With an easy-to-use calendar, professionals can easily keep track of important dates, times and events. Browse 2016 calendars at Staples to find tools that help you stay on schedule.

Choose the Right Calendar Layout
While comparing planners and calendars, users can explore various layout options. Factors to consider when choosing a layout include planner size, the amount of detail on each page and your scheduling needs. Academic calendars typically run from August of one year to December of the following year, allowing students to start each school year with a fresh planner. Other planners generally start in January and include one year of spreads. 

Wall calendars with daily layouts make it easy to plan each day down to the hour, while those with weekly spreads permit users to look at the week ahead on one page. For on-the-go planning, many people prefer planners with monthly spreads. These thin, lightweight options are ideal for scheduling appointments and vacation plans. Monthly layouts are the most common option for calendars.

Calendars of Different Sizes Suit Various Needs
Calendars and planners come in a variety of sizes for each user's needs. Book-style planners and calendars are easy to transport and offer convenience to those who need constant access to their schedule. Binder planners are similar, but they have additional customizable features. Desk calendars lie flat on desks for reference and schedule changes during work hours. Wall calendars are designed to be hanged on the wall, freeing up desk space and making schedule information available to everyone in the room.

2017 Calendars Make It Easy to Plan Ahead
Any of the 2017 calendars you choose should help you plan ahead, keep track of various schedules and make full use of your day. For many professionals, combined use of wall calendars and portable planners is the solution.

Can You Choose Which Pages Are in a Calendar?
Users who like to customize their daily planners often prefer binder planners. This design permits professionals to choose the pages and spreads they want to include. Binder planners often feature options such as contact and address pages, daily schedule spreads, monthly spreads and to-do lists.

Are Academic Calendars Different from Standard Calendars?
Academic planners have some key differences that set them apart from other personal organization tools. In addition to starting at the beginning of the school year, rather than January, they usually have pages for class schedules and teacher contact information. Some academic calendars have spots to note exam dates and homework due dates.

Which Calendars Are Optimal for Business Use?
Since business needs vary, users should compare multiple monthly calendars to find one that fits their style. Those who have frequent meetings, appointments and deadlines benefit from planners with daily scheduling pages. These pages let professionals plan out each hour of the day without running out of space.

Make it to every meeting on time with calendars and planners. Use planners to keep track of personal, professional and medical appointments and feel confident about what each day will bring.

Staples also offers a collection of free printable 2017 calendars for your office or home needs. 



Make sure you get your deals!

							Keeping track of important dates and events is essential, whether you're a parent with children in activities, or a business person looking to create an organized schedule. Calendars come in a variety of sizes and styles from those that fit in your pocket for portability to desktop and wall units that are easy to view. In addition to its own brand, Staples® carries top brands such as House of Doolittle and AT-A-GLANCE®.   Choose the Calendar Format That Works for You Calendars come in a wide array of formats, from those that display a single month to wall models that showcase the upcoming year. Flip styles have a wire binding that makes it simple to turn pages to look at past or future dates. You can store them in a desk drawer or choose to pin them up on a wall or cubicle for increased visibility. Some have a two or three-month view for those who like to see and plan ahead. Dry and wet erase models come with a laminated surface so you can jot down notes, and some even have blank date slots to create a custom calendar that suits a work or home schedule.   Track Upcoming Appointments and Meetings Those who attend a lot of meetings can benefit from a visible calendar that tracks appointments. Choose lined boxes to jot down meeting times and related notes for the upcoming event. Having a desktop calendar helps to keep office employees organized, giving them a space to record upcoming deadlines, meetings, and seminars. They have reinforced corners for holding pages and small items such as business cards in place.   What Size Calendars Are Available? Calendars come in a wide array of sizes from the daily desktop models that showcase two days at once and measure 5 x 7 inches to oversize wall models that measure over 4 feet and come in handy for yearly planning. Desktop pads come as large as 22 x 17 inches and as small as 8.5 x 11 inches to fit smaller surface areas. Those who need a calendar for referencing while on the go can find pocket units that fit in a wallet or briefcase for added convenience.   Can You Purchase Eco-Friendly Calendars? Yes. Many brands offer eco-friendly options, including those made with post-consumer content to lessen the impact on the environment. These units often have a declaration on the packaging to distinguish its recycled content. Additionally, once you finish with a paper calendar, you can recycle the pages and the cardboard if services are available in your area. Laminated, blank calendars also work well as you can use them over and over again, just changing the dates to reflect the current month and year.   What Colors Do Calendars Come In? Shoppers looking for a standard unit can find one in a regular black and white color scheme. Those looking for bold shades can find many that have modern designs or landscape art to brighten up the wall or desk. You can even create custom units by uploading your pictures into special software and make it a memorable experience each time you change the month.

The Amazon founder’s net worth soared to $91 billion Thursday morning, but an afternoon pullback in Amazon stock meant he ended the day at $88.5 billion (and back below Bill Gates). Is it just a matter of time before he retakes the top spot? Judging by the size of the empire he’s amassed on his way to the top of the billionaires list, that could be a fair guess. Bezos’s empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too. Here is a snapshot of his empire, as compiled by Visual Capitalist:LifestyleMarketWatch7 real ways for millennials to save money (not by brownbagging and skipping Starbucks)It seems young people get blamed for everything these days.

They’re also being accused of killing their own net worth.
