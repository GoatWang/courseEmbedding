Click to PrintDean Foods Announces Robert Wiseman Elected To The Board of Directors
DALLAS, Feb. 14, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Dean Foods Company (NYSE: DF) today announced that Robert Tennant Wiseman was elected as a new member of the Board of Directors of Dean Foods Company on February 8, 2013.
"We are thrilled that Robert has agreed to join the Dean Foods Board," said Gregg Tanner, Chief Executive Officer. "The breadth and depth of his business experience in the dairy industry will strengthen the Board's ability to guide Dean Foods to continue to be a leading food and beverage company."
Mr. Wiseman helped grow Robert Wiseman Dairies from a local dairy company in the 1970s to Britain's largest fresh liquid milk processor. He joined the family business in 1975 and in 1994 after the company began trading on the London Stock Exchange, he was appointed Managing Director of Robert Wiseman & Sons PLC. Recently, Mr. Wiseman executed the sale of Robert Wiseman Dairies to the Muller Group in 2012. He currently serves as Non-Executive Director of Robert Wiseman Dairies Limited.
"With the sale of Morningstar and the pending spin-off of The WhiteWave Foods Company, Robert's success in leading strategic business transformations will help Dean Foods focus on driving value in our core business to build on the success of 2012," said Mr. Tanner.
Mr. Wiseman previously served on the Board of UK Dairy for eight years and was appointed its Chairman for a two-year period which ended in September 2012.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.
