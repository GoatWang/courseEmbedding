  EVENT DETAILS
  



Boston Product Marketing Conference 2017
 Disruption--the good kind-happens when you fill a room with the best and the brightest among your peers, thought leaders, and product marketing gurus. That's the inspiration behind Product Marketing Community Boston--created by product marketers for product marketers. With the theme "Architects of Growth", it's a day packed with insights, networking, and "Holy crap, I didn't know that!" moments. Come join us on June 09th at the Boston Park Plaza, where industry leading Architects of Growth will share their insights all morning and than learn how to apply them in afternoon workshops. You will hear from industry leaders such as Pragmatic Marketing, SiriusDecisions, CEB, HUBSPOT, AKAMAI, Baron Strategic, MarketReach and many more.  Product Marketing Community recently and successfully brought the conference to the Toronto and San Francisco market and the feedback was nothing short of amazing. We're excited to bring our event to Boston for all of the Product Marketing Professionals out there!  "As a product marketer, I could not find any event that catered to what I was doing specifically. I'm so glad I attended the Product Marketing Community Conference in San Francisco. I can't wait to attend their 2017 event." - Industry Product Marketing Manager, based in San Francisco  "I was having a lot of challenges in helping my organization understand the differences in Product Management, Product Marketing and Marketing. I attended the Product Marketing Community Conference in Toronto and I was amazed by all of the insights that I learned that day. I was able to take my learnings and apply it to my job the very next day." Software Product Marketing Manager, based in Toronto

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: July 30, 2009

 The Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, founded and led by prominent Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun, was a small non-profit organization with an outsized mission. The Beijing-based group aimed to be a catalyst in "greening" China's manufacturing facilities. The IPE operated public, online databases of air and water violations by factories throughout China, creating a groundbreaking "blacklist" of polluters. By mid-2009, IPE had compiled databases with more than 47,000 air and water violations. To get off the list, 22 multinational corporations took corrective actions and accepted IPE-supervised environmental audits of their Chinese factories. Ma was a champion of increasing access to environmental information, which he believed could bring public pressure on companies to operate more responsibly. Ma also was a well-respected voice on China's environment and a leading advocate of public participation in managing China's environment. But the environmental entrepreneur was searching for ways his organization could make a bigger impact. The case presents the contributions that a non-governmental organization can make in bringing about environmental change. It focuses on the role that information transparency and supply chain improvements can play in reducing pollution.

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Ma (surname).


Ma Jun



Ma at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012



Native name
马军


Born
(1968-05-22) 22 May 1968 (age 49)
Qingdao, China


Ma Jun (simplified Chinese: 马军; traditional Chinese: 馬軍; pinyin: Mǎ Jūn; born 22 May 1968) is a Chinese environmentalist, non-fiction writer, environmental consultant, and journalist. He is a director with the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE).
In the 1990s Ma became known as an investigative journalist, working at the South China Morning Post from 1993 to 2000. There, he began to specialize in articles on environmental subjects. He eventually became the Chief Representative of SCMP.com in Beijing.[1]
He was named as one of the 100 most influential persons in the world by Time magazine in May 2006, in an article written by Hollywood film star Ed Norton.[2]
Ma's 1999 book China's Water Crisis (Zhongguo shui weiji) has been compared to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring – China's first major book on the subject of that nation's environmental crisis.
He directs the IPE (Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs), which developed the China Water Pollution Map[3] (中国水污染地图), the first public database of water pollution information in China. He also serves as environmental consultant for the Sinosphere Corporation.[1]
Ma said: "Water pollution is the most serious environmental issue facing China. It has a huge impact on people’s health and economic development. That is why we have begun to build this database. To protect water resources, we need to encourage public participation and strengthen law enforcement. In some places, polluting factories and companies are being protected by local governments and officials." [4]
In 2010, Ma, addressing air pollution particularly in the wake of efforts made at the time of the Beijing Olympics, "said many of the government’s efforts to curtail pollution had been offset by the number of construction projects that spit dust into the air and the surge in private car ownership."[5]
In 2012, Ma received the Goldman Environmental Prize.[6]
In 2015, Ma Jun became the first Chinese social entrepreneur who won the Skoll Award.[7]

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Ma (surname).


Ma Jun



Ma at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions in 2012



Native name
马军


Born
(1968-05-22) 22 May 1968 (age 49)
Qingdao, China


Ma Jun (simplified Chinese: 马军; traditional Chinese: 馬軍; pinyin: Mǎ Jūn; born 22 May 1968) is a Chinese environmentalist, non-fiction writer, environmental consultant, and journalist. He is a director with the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE).
In the 1990s Ma became known as an investigative journalist, working at the South China Morning Post from 1993 to 2000. There, he began to specialize in articles on environmental subjects. He eventually became the Chief Representative of SCMP.com in Beijing.[1]
He was named as one of the 100 most influential persons in the world by Time magazine in May 2006, in an article written by Hollywood film star Ed Norton.[2]
Ma's 1999 book China's Water Crisis (Zhongguo shui weiji) has been compared to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring – China's first major book on the subject of that nation's environmental crisis.
He directs the IPE (Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs), which developed the China Water Pollution Map[3] (中国水污染地图), the first public database of water pollution information in China. He also serves as environmental consultant for the Sinosphere Corporation.[1]
Ma said: "Water pollution is the most serious environmental issue facing China. It has a huge impact on people’s health and economic development. That is why we have begun to build this database. To protect water resources, we need to encourage public participation and strengthen law enforcement. In some places, polluting factories and companies are being protected by local governments and officials." [4]
In 2010, Ma, addressing air pollution particularly in the wake of efforts made at the time of the Beijing Olympics, "said many of the government’s efforts to curtail pollution had been offset by the number of construction projects that spit dust into the air and the surge in private car ownership."[5]
In 2012, Ma received the Goldman Environmental Prize.[6]
In 2015, Ma Jun became the first Chinese social entrepreneur who won the Skoll Award.[7]

Environmental Policy

Ma Jun developed an online database and digital map that show which factories are violating environmental regulations across China.
After experiencing tremendous economic growth, China now faces severe problems with the environmental quality of its air, land and water. More than 300 million people have no access to safe drinking water, while more than half of its urban residents face daily exposure to badly polluted air. Unsafe levels of lead have been measured in children’s blood and cases of toxic poisoning have increased across several provinces in China.
As the workshop of the world, a significant portion of this pollution comes from multinational corporations with manufacturing and sourcing operations in China. While they all make promises of clean production, transparency and accountability at home, many often fall short on these claims overseas.


In 2008, the Chinese government passed a series of regulations granting the public the right to access certain types of environmental information and ordering local environmental protection bureaus to release data about polluters violating national standards. However, enforcement was weak and the disclosure was piecemeal, making it difficult for the public to access such information. Media coverage of environmental problems was thin, and environmental organizations working to address these issues were few in number and too small to have an impact.
While working at the South China Morning Post in the 1990s, Ma Jun had the opportunity to travel extensively in the country. He witnessed the environmental pollution, eco-degradation and sufferings of people in various watersheds in China. He began focusing on research into water challenges, and his book “China’s Water Crisis” became a national call for environmental protection.
Realizing that access to information was a prerequisite for public participation in pollution control, Ma Jun founded the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), where he organizes the monitoring and enforcement data from the Chinese government to make it available to the public through online air and water pollution maps.
To date, Ma Jun and his team at IPE have exposed over 90,000 air and water violations by local and multinational companies operating in China. Chinese citizens, for the first time in history, have at their fingertips information that reveals which companies are violating environmental regulations across China’s 31 provinces—and with it, the power to demand justice.
Through its Green Choice supply chain program, which has 41 local NGO participants, IPE has encouraged consumers to use their buying power to influence corporate sourcing and manufacturing behavior. Although IPE has no regulatory authority within the government, under Ma Jun’s leadership the organization has succeeded in getting more than 500 companies to disclose to the public their plan and efforts to clean up their facilities. Ma Jun is now working collaboratively with major brands such as Wal-Mart, Nike, GE, Coca Cola, Siemens, Vodafone, H&M, Adidas, Sony, Unilever, Levi’s and Lenovo, all who now regularly reference the maps and self-regulate.
Ma’s most recent high-profile effort involved Apple, one of 29 companies named in a 2010 Green IT report about heavy metal pollution in China—and the only one that did not respond, citing a long-term policy not to disclose its supplier information. He led a coalition of NGOs to launch a “Poison Apple” campaign to protest the company’s lack of supply chain oversight. In September 2011, after a year and a half of silence, Apple approached Chinese environmental groups and began to drive its suppliers to clean up their practices. Ma Jun and his partners continue to communicate with Apple representatives on a regular basis.

马军建立了一个在线数据库和污染地图，披露了在中国运营的本地及跨国公司空气污染和水污染的超标违规排放记录多达90,000多条。此举使得中国的环境信息公开达到史无前例的高度，赋权中国公民呼唤公正。
中国环保工作背景
中国经济在飞速前进的同时，也面临了严峻的环境污染挑战。大气、土壤和水资源质量严重恶化；超过三亿人民无法获得安全饮用水；一半以上的城市居民每天都呼吸着严重污染的空气；多地儿童血液中含铅量超过安全线，国内许多省份的有毒物质污染事件有增无减。
作为世界的工厂，跨国公司在逐渐将制造和采购向中国转移的同时，也把污染转移到了这里。虽然他们在各自国家均宣称要实现清洁生产，保持环境信息公开，并对环境负责，然而许多公司往往无法在海外履行这些承诺。
2008年，中国政府通过了一系列条例，赋予公众获取某些类型环境信息的权利，并要求地方环保局发布排污单位的超标违规排放数据。然而，由于执法能力薄弱，信息披露量严重不足，导致公众难以真正获取有效的环境信息。此外，媒体对环境问题的报道缺乏深度和广度，从事环境信息公开的环保组织数量少，影响弱。环境信息公开之路步履维艰。
马军捍卫环境的动力
20世纪90年代，马军在《南华早报》任职期间，他有机会造访了中国大部分地方。他目睹了中国各大主要河流流域的环境污染、生态恶化，以及人民因此遭受的不幸。于是，他开始潜心研究中国水资源面临的挑战。他的《中国水危机》一书向全国吹响了保护环境的号角。
马军意识到公众参与污染控制的前提是能够获取环境信息，因此他创立了公众与环境研究中心（IPE），搜集政府的环境监测和执法数据，并以在线的空气和水污染地图的可视化形式向公众公开数据。
草根行动的影响
到目前为止，马军和他的公众与环境信息研究中心（IPE）披露的跨国公司和本土企业大气、水污染超标违规排放记录达90,000对条。人们只需点击鼠标就能知道全国31个省中有哪些公司违反了环保法律法规，这在中国是前所未有的。掌握此类信息为普通公民维护自己的环境权益提供了基础。
公众与环境信息研究中心（IPE）还成立了针对产品供应链的“绿色选择”项目，吸引了41家本土民间组织的参与。该中心号召消费者利用他们的购买选择权力来影响公司的采购和生产行为。虽然作为一个民间组织没有政府的监管权力，但是在马军的领导下，IPE成功地让500多家公司向公众披露治理工厂污染问题的计划和措施。如今，与马军合作的大品牌包括：沃尔玛、耐克、GE、可口可乐、西门子、沃达丰，H&M、阿迪达斯、索尼、联合利华、李维斯和联想等。这些品牌公司如今都会经常性地去依照污染地图和数据库中的信息进行自我监管。
马军最近一次备受瞩目的行动涉及了大名鼎鼎的美国苹果公司。苹果和其他28家公司在2010年中国绿色IT行业报告中，因重金属污染问题被点名，但苹果是唯一一家没有做出回应的公司，他们的理由是供应商名单保密是苹果长期以来的政策。马军领导了一个民间组织联盟，发起了一场“毒苹果”运动，抨击苹果公司缺乏对供应链的监管。2011年9月，在沉默了一年半之后，苹果公司开始与中国环保组织接触，并敦促其供应商开展清洁生产的整改。马军和他的伙伴们继续与苹果的代表们进行定期沟通。
 关于戈德曼环境保护奖
戈德曼环境保护奖支持不畏险阻，赢得环保胜利的个人，并鼓励平凡的人采取不平凡的行动来保护地球。戈德曼环境奖于1989年由民权领袖和慈善家理查德•戈德曼和妻子罗达•戈德曼创立。两位创始人已经离世，如今理事会的工作由他们的子女领导。
戈德曼奖侯选人由世界各地的环保团体和环保人士秘密提名，并由国际评委会最终确定获奖者。获奖者将在旧金山和华盛顿参加为期 10 日的交流访问、颁奖礼、新闻发布会等活动，并将有机会与众多政治、公共政策和环保领袖会面。更多信息，请点击 www.goldmanprize.org.

Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs






 


Awarded: 2015
Issue Areas: Environmental Sustainability · Sustainable Markets
Countries Served: China
Web: ipe.org.cn


 






About the Organization
The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) is a non-profit organization based in Beijing. They have developed pollution databases to monitor corporate environmental performance and to facilitate public participation in environmental governance.
IPE provides a wealth of information about the state of pollution in China, and the companies and factories responsible. Their website allows users to search the environmental records of Chinese manufacturers, locate the companies on a map, and view the status of air and water pollution in their regions.
IPE’s aim is to expand environmental information disclosure to allow communities to fully understand the hazards in the surrounding environment, thereby promoting public participation in environmental governance.
The IPE is a member of a coalition of Chinese NGOs that promotes a global green supply chain by pushing large corporations to pay attention to the environmental performance of their suppliers. This “Green Choice Alliance” consumer initiative considers the environmental performance of manufacturers and calls on consumers and brands to use their purchasing power to make green choices.
 


Economic progress in China has come at a cost – serious pollution and degradation of air, water, and land. IPE analyzes data on environmental violations and makes it accessible to  the press, investors, and citizens.Ma Jun's experience as a journalist convinced him that transparency and disclosure are more urgently needed than additional regulation.1,400 factories have taken steps to reduce pollution as a result of data transparency.  






Ambition for Change
Information on sources of pollution pressures multinational companies to force their subsidiaries and suppliers to clean up factories, and helps the central government hold local governments accountable for enforcement.




Path to Scale
Citizen Engagement in Policy Action
Web-based platform makes pollution information widely available. Partnerships with grassroots organizations encourage dissemination and action. Partnerships with companies and governments identify practical and reasonable solutions.




Business Model
Philanthropic support for educational and disclosure activities.









Skoll Awardee


Ma JunDirector, Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs 


As an investigative journalist traveling throughout China, Ma Jun saw the dark side of his country’s economic growth – polluted rivers and lakes, foul air. His 1999 book, China’s Water Crisis, was the first major publication on China’s environment, often compared to Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring as a call for massive action. His research showed that despite good intentions, government capacity to enforce environmental standards was weak. Polluters often found penalties and fines less onerous than the cost of compliance. Convinced that public engagement was crucial for better compliance, he founded the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in 2006.

IPE gathers and analyzes hard-to-find, public environmental data on water and air quality and environmental violations records across China. IPE makes this data accessible and easy to use, so that the press, investors, and citizens can hold suppliers, multinational corporations, and local governments accountable. IPE’s Corporate Information Transparency Index ranks multinational brands by their environmental impact. Its Pollution Information Transparency Index ranks 113 Chinese cities according to their level of environmental information disclosure. A recently launched mobile app allows users to see air quality by location and which nearby companies are polluting. And through its Green Choice Alliance, IPE partners with grassroots NGOs who pressure factories and help publicize environmental violations to inspire local regulatory action.

Impact & Accomplishments

15,000 companies represented on the pollution map
1,400 cited factories, including factories from the most polluting industries, such as textiles and electronics, have taken steps to decrease pollution (IPE worked directly with 500 of these)
IPE’s Green Choices Alliance has helped 150 international companies improve environmental performance in their supply chains.

Transcriptions

Ma Chün








This is a Chinese name; the family name is Ma.
Ma Jun (fl. 220–265),[1] courtesy name Deheng (徳衡), was a Chinese mechanical engineer and government official during the Three Kingdoms era of China. His most notable invention was that of the south-pointing chariot, a directional compass vehicle which actually had no magnetic function, but was operated by use of differential gears (which applies equal amount of torque to driving wheels rotating at different speeds).[2] It is because of this revolutionary device (and other achievements) that Ma Jun is known as one of the most brilliant mechanical engineers and inventors of his day (alongside Zhang Heng of the earlier Eastern Han Dynasty). The device was re-invented by many after Ma Jun, including the astronomer and mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429-500 AD). In the later medieval dynastic periods, Ma Jun's south-pointing chariot was combined in a single device with the distance-measuring odometer.

According to his friend and contemporary poet and philosopher Fu Xuan (217-278 AD), Ma Jun was born in Fufeng, located in the Wei River valley between Wugong and Baoji.[3] In his youth Ma Jun traveled throughout modern day Henan province, and obtained a minor literary degree, or bo shi.[3] Despite this degree, Ma Jun was relatively poor in his youth, yet found means to gain recognition by employing his natural genius in creating mechanical contraptions and inventions.
Ma Jun was a somewhat distinguished official serving under the northern state of Wei, becoming a Policy Review Advisor (Ji Shi Zhong).[2] Ma Jun once oversaw the construction of Chong Hua's palace, under the orders of Emperor Ming of Wei, Cao Rui. Ma Jun was very well known in Wei as a very gifted designer of weapons and certain types of devices, and was praised especially by Fu Xuan in an essay of his. Fu Xuan noted that Ma Jun was not the best orator or master of rhetorics, and had trouble conveying his ideas to others with his somewhat introverted personality. Nonetheless, he gained fame for his mechanical genius, and is universally considered one of the greatest mechanical engineers of ancient China.
Engineering and technological achievements[edit]

One of Ma Jun's early inventions was an improved silk loom, which, according to Fu Xuan, earned Ma Jun considerable recognition for his innovative skill.[3] In his time, silk looms generally had fifty heddles and fifty treadles, some even up to sixty of each.[3] Ma Jun crafted a loom that had only twelve treadles, which not only made the process faster and more efficient, but also allowed the weaving of new intricate patterns.[3]
While serving the Wei court, Ma Jun got into a dispute with the Permanent Counsellor Gaotang Long and the Cavalry General Qin Lang at court over the concept of the south-pointing carriage, or the south-pointing chariot. The minister and the general mocked Ma Jun for his belief in historical texts that the south-pointing chariot had actually been invented in the past (as the legend goes, by the Yellow Emperor), something they viewed as nonsensical, non-historical myth. Ma Jun retorted against them, saying "Empty arguments with words cannot (in any way) compare with a test which will show practical results".[2] After being instructed to craft such a device, Ma Jun completed his fully functional design of the south-pointing chariot in the year 255 AD.[4] With this mechanical-driven compass-vehicle device, Ma Jun created one of the first mechanical devices in the world to employ differential gear designs. Referring to history of differential gears, Ma Jun's differential gear is the earliest historically verifiable design. In China the south-pointing chariot was re-invented a second time by Zu Chongzhi (429-500 AD) due to the original detailed instructions being lost.
For the Emperor Ming of Wei, he once invented an intricate hydraulic-powered, mechanical-operated puppet theatre (much more complex than the mechanical puppet set discovered by Liu Bang, first Emperor of the Han Dynasty, when he observed the state-absorbed items taken from the old treasury of the deceased Qin Shi Huang).[5] His puppet theatre is similar to that of a Greek model invented by Heron of Alexandria, the difference being that the latter used instead a rotating cylindrical cogwheel with ropes and pulleys to operate his mechanical theatre. Joseph Needham describes Ma Jun's mechanical theatre in a passage taken from the Sanguo Zhi, Records of the Three Kingdoms:


“
Certain persons offered to the emperor a theatre of puppets, which could be set up in various scenes, but all motionless. The emperor asked whether they could be made to move, and Ma Jun said that they could. The emperor asked whether it could be possible to make the whole thing more ingenious, and again Ma Jun said yes, and accepted the command to do it. He took a large piece of wood and fashioned it into the shape of a wheel which rotated in a horizontal position by the power of unseen water. He furthermore arranged images of singing-girls which played music and danced, and when (a particular) puppet came upon the scene, other wooden men beat drums and blew upon flutes. Ma Jun also made a mountain with wooden images dancing on balls, throwing swords about, hanging upside down on rope ladders, and generally behaving in an assured and easy manner. Government officials were in their offices, pounding and grinding was going on, cocks were fighting, and all was continually changing and moving ingeniously with a hundred variations...[5]
”


Possibly inspired by this incredible mechanical theatre of puppets, Qu Zhi of the subsequent Jin Dynasty made similar mechanical sets with wooden dolls. Joseph Needham states that he was famous for his "wooden dolls' house, with images which opened doors and bowed, and for his 'rats' market', which had figures which automatically closed the doors when the rats wanted to leave".[6]
Ma Jun was also responsible for the construction of square-pallet chain pumps meant for irrigation. However, Ma Jun was not the first in China to invent such a device. An earlier account was made in the year 80 by philosopher Wang Chong, in his Discourses Weighed in the Balance. The Eastern Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang once ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of chain pumps outside the capital city of Luoyang, used for irrigation and means of fresh water source. Ma Jun constructed his square-pallet chain pumps to water newly designated garden space established within Luoyang by Emperor Ming of Wei (Cao Rui).[2]

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Ma.
Ma Jun (fl. 220–265),[1] courtesy name Deheng (徳衡), was a Chinese mechanical engineer and government official during the Three Kingdoms era of China. His most notable invention was that of the south-pointing chariot, a directional compass vehicle which actually had no magnetic function, but was operated by use of differential gears (which applies equal amount of torque to driving wheels rotating at different speeds).[2] It is because of this revolutionary device (and other achievements) that Ma Jun is known as one of the most brilliant mechanical engineers and inventors of his day (alongside Zhang Heng of the earlier Eastern Han Dynasty). The device was re-invented by many after Ma Jun, including the astronomer and mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429-500 AD). In the later medieval dynastic periods, Ma Jun's south-pointing chariot was combined in a single device with the distance-measuring odometer.

Abstract:

 The Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, founded and led by prominent Chinese Environmentalist Ma Jun, was a small non-profit organization with an outsized mission. The Beijing-based group aimed to be a catalyst in 'greening' China's manufacturing facilities. The IPE operated public, on-line databases of air and water violations by factories throughout China, creating a groundbreaking 'blacklist' of polluters. By mid-2009, IPE had compiled databases with more than 47,000 air and water violations. To get off the list, 22 multinational corporations took corrective actions and accepted IPE-supervised environmental audits of their Chinese factories. Ma was a champion of increasing access to environmental information, which he believed could bring public pressure on companies to operate more responsibly. Ma also was a well-respected voice on China's environment and a leading advocate of public participation in managing China's environment. But the environmental entrepreneur was searching for ways his organization could make a bigger impact. The case presents the contributions that a non-governmental organization can make in bringing about environmental change. It focuses on the role that information transparency and supply chain improvements can play in reducing pollution.
