The building was evaluated in six categories: energy, water, resources, emissions, indoor environment and environmental management systems. The Riverwoods Corporate Center was developed by Irgens Development Partners, LLC and Podolsky Northstar CORFAC International. The Green Building Initiative, which owns and operates Green Globes in the U.S., is a national not-for-profit organization headquartered in Portland, OR.

Two Office Buildings Added at Redland Corporate Center


September 01, 2009 ROCKVILLE, Md. – Two Class-A core and shell office buildings and a six-story parking garage join an existing office building at Perseus Realty, LLC's Redland Corporate Center, a 28-acre office campus in Rockville, Md. Clark Construction Group, LLC, built the nine-story, 208,344 rentable square-foot Redland II and the six-story 139,120 rentable square-foot Redland III office buildings, as well as a 314,600 square-foot parking garage. The $53 million project was completed earlier this summer.
Redland II and Redland III are comprised of a structural steel frame on concrete footings with concrete grade beams; Redland II has 46 drilled piers. Both buildings' skin is architectural precast concrete panels with a stone apron and embedded medallions. Exterior glass elements include ribbon windows with a curtain wall system. In addition, the storefront entrance to Redland II is comprised of a three-quarter-inch thick structural glass system affixed with spider brackets that acts as a self-supporting system.
The lobbies in both buildings feature walls lined with cherry millwork, granite, and glass panels and a granite stone floor with stainless steel trim. The lobby doors are an all-glass system with stainless steel trim. Located in each lobby is a display case that will hold the work of renowned Washington, D.C. glass artist Mindy Weisel. She also provided a large-scale sculpted glass piece for the project's center island.
Two of the structural precast garage's six levels are below grade. Sitework for the garage required approximately 15,000 cubic yards of mass excavation, 40,000 square feet of new asphalt roads and parking areas, and remediation to the existing site.
The Clark project team faced several logistical and schedule-related challenges while constructing the Redland Corporate Center. A single access point to the project site, shared by construction traffic and the existing office building's tenants and visitors, was controlled by a parking gate and attendant. The site's restricted footprint prevented the sequenced phasing of each building and garage. With a single staging area for all three project components, materials for each of the structures often arrived simultaneously. Despite these challenges, Redland Corporate Center was completed ahead of schedule.
The Redland Corporate Center project is designed to achieve LEED® Silver certification.

FAQs



Could you send me samples or coupons for your products?


Please contact your local Unilever careline to see if free samples or coupons are being distributed. You can find their details from our contacts page.



I wish to suggest a business proposal to you. How do I go about it?

We partner with external organisations – individuals, businesses, existing suppliers, universities or NGOs – to research and develop new products in an approach called Open Innovation.Read more here about Open Innovation and find out what we are looking for – our challenges and wants.Our company European Ventures Ltd – the European venture capital arm of Unilever – partners with entrepreneurs to develop products, new distribution channels and marketing technologies in the following areas: technologies linked to sustainability; personal care products and distribution; digital marketing; novel foods; and health and vitality. To find out more, visit Unilever Ventures where there are full details and a section on online submissions.



Does Unilever test any of its products on animals?

Our commitment to ending animal testing is under-pinned by our research since the 1980s to develop alternatives to animal tests for assessing safety. We routinely use a wide range of non-animal approaches to assess the safety of our products for consumers. We do not test our products on animals, but occasionally some ingredients we use have been tested to meet government requirements. A few governments still test our products on animals in their own laboratories, and we are working with these authorities to help them adopt non-animal approaches.Our leading-edge research has one clear purpose: to continue to develop new non-animal approaches that can guarantee our products are safe. We are making good progress in developing a non-animal approach for assessing the safety of ingredients that may cause skin allergy. Information about our research strategy and partners is available on our Safety Science in the 21st Century website. Find out more about alternative approaches to animal testing.

New backyard for maker of Weber grills


The maker of Weber grills is cooking up new office space in Rolling Meadows.Weber-Stephen Products LLC leased all 47,980 square feet of a two-story office building at 2900 W. Golf Road, confirmed Colliers International broker Jason Simon, who represented the landlord in the deal.It is unclear whether Weber is moving there from its Palatine headquarters, about 6 miles north at 200 E. Daniels Road, or whether it is simply adding space. Michael Kempster, global chief marketing officer at privately held Weber, did not respond to requests for comment.The premium grill maker plans to move to the Rolling Meadows space in April, said Mr. Simon, a Rosemont-based senior vice president at Seattle-based Colliers.Any new lease is welcome news  in the northwest suburbs, where overall office vacancy was 26.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 — second-highest of all submarkets — vs. 27.2 percent a year earlier, according to Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. Overall suburban vacancy was 24.3 percent. The Golf Road property became vacant when its only remaining tenant, Addison, Texas-based commercial cleaning and janitorial company Jani-King International Inc., moved out in February of the fourth of the building it occupied. Jani-King leased 9,628 square feet at Two Woodfield Lake, a building at 1100 E. Woodfield Road in Schaumburg, Mr. Simon said.Jani-King had been in the Rolling Meadows structure since 2009, when a venture led by Jani-King's president, Jerry Crawford, bought it out of foreclosure for $2.6 million.Mr. Simon, who also represented Jani-King in its move, declined to disclose the length of the Weber lease. Mr. Crawford did not respond to a request for comment.'INCREASING THEIR VISIBILITY'Weber's new space is between Golf Road and Interstate 90, alongside larger office towers in the Meadows Corporate Center office complex. It is next door to the 10-story tower that insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher bought last month for its new headquarters.Weber is “increasing their visibility, right on Golf Road with great signage,” broker Gregg Raus, a JLL executive vice president who is not involved in the deal.BDT Capital Partners LLC, the Chicago-based investment firm headed by former  investment banker Byron Trott, bought a majority stake in Weber-Stephen, the top seller of grills in the U.S., in 2010.
