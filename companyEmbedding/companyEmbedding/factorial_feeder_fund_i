In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

{\displaystyle (n+1)!=(n+1)\cdot n!}

In order for this recurrence relation to be extended to n=0, it is necessary to define

so that





1
!

⋅

!
=

.


{\displaystyle 1!=1\cdot 0!=1\ .}



Other consequences that indicate defining 



0
!
=
1


{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

.


{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of









n

(

)
⋯
(
n
−
k
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is








n

k

=

(

k
(
k

)
(
k

)
⋯
(
1
)



.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n


k
_



=



n
!


(
n
−
k
)
!



;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}




while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property[7][8] of binomial coefficients:

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm





ln
⁡
n
!
=

∑

x
=

n


ln
⁡
x
.


{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

)

d
x


{\displaystyle \int _{1}^{n}\ln x\,dx\leq \sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x\leq \int _{0}^{n}\ln(x+1)\,dx}



which gives us the estimate

e


)

+
1.


{\displaystyle n\ln \left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)+1\leq \ln n!\leq (n+1)\ln \left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)+1.}



Hence 



ln
⁡
n
!
∼
n
ln
⁡
n


{\displaystyle \ln n!\sim n\ln n}

 (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that





e


(


n

)


n

n
!

e


(



n

e


)


n
+
1


.


{\displaystyle e\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}\leq n!\leq e\left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)^{n+1}.}



It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have 



(
n

/

3

)

n


<
n
!


{\displaystyle (n/3)^{n}<n!}

, and for all n ≥ 6 we have 



n
!
<
(
n

/

2

)

n




{\displaystyle n!<(n/2)^{n}}

.




Comparison of Stirling's approximation with the factorial


For large n we get a better estimate for the number n! using Stirling's approximation:





n
!
∼


2
π
n




(


n
e


)


n


.


{\displaystyle n!\sim {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}.}



This in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation:

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}<n!<{\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}e^{\frac {1}{12n}}.}



Another approximation for ln n! is given by Srinivasa Ramanujan (Ramanujan 1988)

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

i




⌋



{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

0

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was





Γ

∏

n


(
z
+
k
)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k

=


{

if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k

n

0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large

Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k

{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]

Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 factorials. So the superfactorial of 4 is

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula

(

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n
=

{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

{\displaystyle H(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n}k^{k}=1^{1}\cdot 2^{2}\cdot 3^{3}\cdots (n-1)^{n-1}\cdot n^{n}.}



For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

{\displaystyle H(n)\sim An^{(6n^{2}+6n+1)/12}e^{-n^{2}/4}}



where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

so that

{\displaystyle 1!=1\cdot 0!=1\ .}



Other consequences that indicate defining 



0
!
=
1


{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

.


{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of









n


k
_



=
n
(
n
−

)
(
n
−
2
)
⋯
(
n
−
k
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is








n


k
_




k
!



=



n
(
n

)
(

⋯

)


k
(
k
−
1
)
(
k

)
⋯
(
1
)



.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n


k
_



=



n
!


(
n
−
k
)
!



;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}




while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property[7][8] of binomial coefficients:

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

i




⌋



{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

n

0

n

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was

∏

n


(
z

k
)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

{\displaystyle (2k-1)!!=\prod _{i=1}^{k}(2i-1)={\frac {(2k)!}{2^{k}k!}}={\frac {_{2k}P_{k}}{2^{k}}}={\frac {{(2k)}^{\underline {k}}}{2^{k}}}.}



For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0
<
n
≤
k




n
(
(
n

)



if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:









n
!

Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]
Main article: Large numbers
"N$" redirects here. For the currency, see Namibian dollar.
Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 factorials. So the superfactorial of 4 is





sf

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (4)=1!\times 2!\times 3!\times 4!=288.}

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula





sf
⁡
(
n
)
=

∏

0
≤
i

j
≤
n


(
j
−
i
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n
=
0


{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

Alternative definition[edit]

Clifford Pickover in his 1995 book Keys to Infinity used a new notation, n$, to define the superfactorial

or as,

$

[
4
]
n

{\displaystyle n\$=n![4]n!}



where the [4] notation denotes the hyper4 operator, or using Knuth's up-arrow notation,





n
$

n

(
n

.


{\displaystyle n\$=(n!)\uparrow \uparrow (n!).}



This sequence of superfactorials starts:

{\displaystyle 3\$=6[4]6={^{6}}6=6^{6^{6^{6^{6^{6}}}}}.}



Here, as is usual for compound exponentiation, the grouping is understood to be from right to left:






a

c




=

a

(

)


.


{\displaystyle a^{b^{c}}=a^{(b^{c})}.}



Hyperfactorial[edit]
Occasionally the hyperfactorial of n is considered. It is written as H(n) and defined by





H

{\displaystyle H(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n}k^{k}=1^{1}\cdot 2^{2}\cdot 3^{3}\cdots (n-1)^{n-1}\cdot n^{n}.}



For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

{\displaystyle H(n)\sim An^{(6n^{2}+6n+1)/12}e^{-n^{2}/4}}



where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of

⋯

)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n

;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

Hence

{\displaystyle e\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}\leq n!\leq e\left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)^{n+1}.}



It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have

{\displaystyle n!\sim {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}.}

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

n

0

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)

∫

∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

There is a misconception that

(

{\displaystyle \displaystyle \log(z!)=P(z)}

 or 



log
⁡

)
)
=
P
(
z
)


{\displaystyle \log(\Gamma (z\!+\!1))=P(z)}

 for any complex z ≠ 0.[citation needed] Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while 




|

ℑ

Γ

z

)

|

<
π


{\displaystyle |\Im (\Gamma (z\!+\!1))|<\pi }

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

ℑ

z

>

{\displaystyle |\Im (z)|>2}

 or 



ℜ

z
)
>

{\displaystyle \Re (z)>2}

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,





(

)

{\displaystyle (2k-1)!!=\prod _{i=1}^{k}(2i-1)={\frac {(2k)!}{2^{k}k!}}={\frac {_{2k}P_{k}}{2^{k}}}={\frac {{(2k)}^{\underline {k}}}{2^{k}}}.}



For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0
<
n
≤
k




n
(
(
n
−
k
)

!

(
k
)


)



if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:









n
!



=
n
!
!
⋅
(
n

)
!
!
,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}n!&=n!!\cdot (n-1)!!,\ n\geq 1\\&=n!!!\cdot (n-1)!!!\cdot (n-2)!!!,\ n\geq 2\\&=\prod _{i=0}^{k-1}(n-i)!^{(k)},\ {\text{ for }}k\in \mathbb {Z} ^{+},n\geq k-1.\end{aligned}}}



Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]
Main article: Large numbers
"N$" redirects here. For the currency, see Namibian dollar.
Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 factorials. So the superfactorial of 4 is





sf

(

4

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (4)=1!\times 2!\times 3!\times 4!=288.}



In general

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula





sf
⁡
(
n
)
=

∏

0
≤
i
<
j
≤
n


(
j
−
i
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n
=
0


{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

Alternative definition[edit]

Clifford Pickover in his 1995 book Keys to Infinity used a new notation, n$, to define the superfactorial

or as,





n
$

n
!
[
4
]
n

{\displaystyle n\$=n![4]n!}



where the [4] notation denotes the hyper4 operator, or using Knuth's up-arrow notation,





n
$
=
(
n
!
)
↑↑
(
n

)
.


{\displaystyle n\$=(n!)\uparrow \uparrow (n!).}



This sequence of superfactorials starts:

{\displaystyle 1\$=1}

{\displaystyle 3\$=6[4]6={^{6}}6=6^{6^{6^{6^{6^{6}}}}}.}



Here, as is usual for compound exponentiation, the grouping is understood to be from right to left:






a


b

c




=

a

(

b

)


.


{\displaystyle a^{b^{c}}=a^{(b^{c})}.}



Hyperfactorial[edit]
Occasionally the hyperfactorial of n is considered. It is written as H(n) and defined by





H

∏

{\displaystyle H(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n}k^{k}=1^{1}\cdot 2^{2}\cdot 3^{3}\cdots (n-1)^{n-1}\cdot n^{n}.}



For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

{\displaystyle H(n)\sim An^{(6n^{2}+6n+1)/12}e^{-n^{2}/4}}



where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

Other consequences that indicate defining

{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of

)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is

{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as

;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

{\displaystyle n\ln \left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)+1\leq \ln n!\leq (n+1)\ln \left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)+1.}



Hence

{\displaystyle \ln n!\sim n\ln n}

 (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that

{\displaystyle e\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}\leq n!\leq e\left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)^{n+1}.}



It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have

{\displaystyle (n/3)^{n}<n!}

, and for all n ≥ 6 we have

{\displaystyle n!<(n/2)^{n}}

.

{\displaystyle n!\sim {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}.}



This in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation:

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i

1


∞



⌊

p

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

n

0

n

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ

z
)

∫

∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was





Γ

)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

{\displaystyle \Gamma \left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)=\left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\right)!=\Pi \left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\right)={\sqrt {\pi }},}



from which it follows that for n ∈ N,

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

{\displaystyle \displaystyle \log(z!)=P(z)}

 or

P
(
z
)


{\displaystyle \log(\Gamma (z\!+\!1))=P(z)}

 for any complex z ≠ 0.[citation needed] Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while 




|

ℑ

Γ

z

|

{\displaystyle |\Im (\Gamma (z\!+\!1))|<\pi }

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

{\displaystyle |\Im (z)|>2}

 or 



ℜ

z
)
>

{\displaystyle \Re (z)>2}

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0
<
n
≤
k




n
(
(
n

(

)



if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:









n
!

Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]

"N$" redirects here. For the currency, see Namibian dollar.
Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n

{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

{\displaystyle a^{b^{c}}=a^{(b^{c})}.}

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

so that

{\displaystyle 1!=1\cdot 0!=1\ .}



Other consequences that indicate defining

{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of

⋯

)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n

;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

which gives us the estimate

{\displaystyle n\ln \left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)+1\leq \ln n!\leq (n+1)\ln \left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)+1.}



Hence

{\displaystyle \ln n!\sim n\ln n}

 (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that

{\displaystyle e\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}\leq n!\leq e\left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)^{n+1}.}



It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have 



(

{\displaystyle (n/3)^{n}<n!}

, and for all n ≥ 6 we have

{\displaystyle n!<(n/2)^{n}}

.




Comparison of Stirling's approximation with the factorial


For large n we get a better estimate for the number n! using Stirling's approximation:

{\displaystyle n!\sim {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}.}



This in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation:

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

i




⌋



{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,








n
−

s

p


(
n
)


p

,


{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

n

0

n

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was





Γ
(
z
)
=

n
→

n

z


n

∏

k

n


(
z
+
k
)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

{\displaystyle \log(\Gamma (z\!+\!1))=P(z)}

 for any complex z ≠ 0.[citation needed] Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while

{\displaystyle |\Im (\Gamma (z\!+\!1))|<\pi }

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

{\displaystyle |\Im (z)|>2}

 or 



ℜ

{\displaystyle \Re (z)>2}

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{

if

n

k




n
(

if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:

Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n

{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

(

{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

Other consequences that indicate defining

{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of









n

(

)
⋯
(
n
−
k
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is








n

(

(
1
)



.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n


k
_



=



n
!


(
n
−
k
)
!



;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}




while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property[7][8] of binomial coefficients:

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:

The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was

∏

n


(
z

k
)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]

{\displaystyle (2k-1)!!=\prod _{i=1}^{k}(2i-1)={\frac {(2k)!}{2^{k}k!}}={\frac {_{2k}P_{k}}{2^{k}}}={\frac {{(2k)}^{\underline {k}}}{2^{k}}}.}



For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0
<
n
≤
k




n
(
(
n

)



if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:









n
!



=

!

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}n!&=n!!\cdot (n-1)!!,\ n\geq 1\\&=n!!!\cdot (n-1)!!!\cdot (n-2)!!!,\ n\geq 2\\&=\prod _{i=0}^{k-1}(n-i)!^{(k)},\ {\text{ for }}k\in \mathbb {Z} ^{+},n\geq k-1.\end{aligned}}}



Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]
Main article: Large numbers
"N$" redirects here. For the currency, see Namibian dollar.
Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 factorials. So the superfactorial of 4 is





sf
⁡
(
4

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (4)=1!\times 2!\times 3!\times 4!=288.}



In general

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula





sf
⁡
(
n
)
=

∏

0
≤
i
<
j
≤
n


(
j
−
i
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n
=
0


{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

Alternative definition[edit]

where the [4] notation denotes the hyper4 operator, or using Knuth's up-arrow notation,

{\displaystyle n\$=(n!)\uparrow \uparrow (n!).}

{\displaystyle a^{b^{c}}=a^{(b^{c})}.}



Hyperfactorial[edit]

{\displaystyle H(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n}k^{k}=1^{1}\cdot 2^{2}\cdot 3^{3}\cdots (n-1)^{n-1}\cdot n^{n}.}



For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

{\displaystyle H(n)\sim An^{(6n^{2}+6n+1)/12}e^{-n^{2}/4}}



where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

The hedge fund manager who challenged the US wireless broadband connectivity system by launching a cheaper alternative has been under investigation by the SEC for alleged manipulation of bond prices and favoring certain clients over others. The SEC said that Philip Falcone, through his hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, had “fraudulently obtained $113.2 million from a hedge fund that he advised and misappropriated the proceeds to pay his personal taxes.” Falcone took out a loan against his hedge fund in 2009. Ex-Goldman Partner Chan Named Dymon CEO As Hedge Fund Grows (Bloomberg)
Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore) Pte, the best-performing large hedge fund in Asia in 2011, hired a former head of macro trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as chief executive officer, strengthening its interest-rate trading. David Chan, 41, will also be a partner of Singapore-based Dymon, said founder Danny Yong. Chan, who headed macro trading at Goldman in Asia, will focus on managing the investment team, Yong said. The appointment is subject to regulators’ approval. Ex-JPMorgan Trader Feldstein Biggest Winner Betting Against Bank (Bloomberg)
Andrew Feldstein, who bet against JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) before helping the bank unwind more than $20 billion of trades, has emerged as one of the biggest winners among hedge-fund managers profiting from a flawed strategy. The $4.3 billion flagship fund of Feldstein’s BlueMountain Capital Management LLC returned 9.5 percent this year through June 22, according to a person familiar with the data. That’s up from the 5.4 percent return before JPMorgan announced a $2 billion loss by one of its traders known as the London Whale. BlueMountain, which was on the other side of those wagers, stands to make as much as $300 million, said market participants familiar with the trades. Hedge Fund ETF: Take the Edge Off (InvestingDaily)
Investors are worried that the global economy could soon be headed for another recession, and those fears have once again inspired a “risk-off” mentality in the markets. Anxious investors are increasingly looking for ways to insulate their portfolios from market volatility, so they’re turning to exchange- traded funds (ETF) that use a mix of alternative investment strategies to achieve that end. IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker ETF (NYSE: QAI) employs a hedge fund-like investment strategy that may not be impressive from a total-return standpoint, but is notable for its ability to limit volatility. Hedge fund-of-funds assets plunge 20.4% over 5 years (Pionline)
Assets invested in hedge funds of funds declined 20.4%, or $233 billion, to $910 billion in the five years ended March 31, according to analysis from database provider eVestment Alliance. The decline in hedge funds-of-funds assets was even steeper — down 36% — from the industry’s peak of $1.421 trillion at the end of the second quarter 2008. By contrast, hedge funds-of-funds assets were up $19.8 billion for the quarter ended March 31 despite net outflows of $7.3 billion, due “primarily to performance gains,” eVestment Alliance’s report said. Hedge funds boost bets against the euro (Reuters)
Large hedge funds increased their bets against the euro last week as investors viewed the two-day European Union summit in Brussels with skepticism. The funds boosted their short position against euro futures to $20 billion in the latest week from $17.9 billion in the previous week, according to an analysis in Hedge Fund Monitor, a report compiled by analysts with Bank of America. SEI Named Hedge Fund Administrator of the Year by Global Investor Magazine (Sys-Con)
SEI (NASDAQ: SEIC) today announced that it was named “Hedge Fund Administrator of the Year” at the 2012 Global Investor Awards, held in London on June 28. The award, presented by Global Investor magazine, is the latest in a series of awards recognizing SEI’s leadership and technology in providing enhanced data services and operational outsourcing services to the investment management industry worldwide. “We’re honored to be recognized by Global Investor as Hedge Fund Administrator of the Year,” said Steve Meyer, Executive Vice President and Head of SEI’s Investment Manager Services division. BofAML: Hedge Funds Shed 1.38% In Q2 (Finalternatives)
Hedge funds were down 1.38% in the second quarter of 2012 according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch investable hedge fund composite index. Hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500, which was down 5.44% quarter to date. According to the latest BofAML Hedge Fund Monitor, CTA Advisors (up 0.99% QTD) and macro strategies (up 0.46% QTD) were the best performers in the second quarter and the only strategies to end in the black. Hedge Funders Einhorn, Shak Alive in Richest-Ever Poker Tournament (Observer)
Hedge fund manager David Einhorn is playing cards right now in what is apparently the biggest poker tournament ever, and if you’re one those people who likes watching others gamble, or can’t get enough news of the Greenlight Capital founder—you can watch the livestream here. The 48 participants in the World Series of Poker’s Big One for One Drop put up $1 million to enter the tournament, with about 11 percent of each player’s buy-in supporting a nonprofit organization that seeks to provide access to clean water. Organizers say the first prize of more than $18 million is the richest-ever pool for a poker tournament. How Will the JOBS Act Impact Hedge Fund and Private Equity Marketing (SBWire)
At its core, the JOBS Act included “Title II – Access to Capital for Job Creators.” This provision lifted an 80-year-old prohibition on general advertising by private equity funds and hedge funds. For financial marketers who once had to operate clandestinely, the JOBS Act adds more flexibility, opportunity, and freedom compared to the Securities Exchanges Commissions draconian policies. Tripp Kyle, a partner at the public relations firm Brunswick Group, said, “I think it presents a real opportunity for firms to evolve their mind-set from what they can’t do to what they can and perhaps should be doing.” Investors back Ucits hedge multi-manager model in theory, if not in practice (InvestmentEurope)
Investors in Ucits hedge funds overwhelmingly believe in the fund of funds model for investing their vehicle type, but it is not clear they are putting their money behind them, as 40% of the products hold €20m or less. In surveys of the offshore hedge fund industry, investors typically say between $50m and $100m is the minimum size for a workable hedge fund, and funds of funds need more to spread their risk adequately between funds, and conduct due diligence, among other expenses. The Chinese Wants to Replicate Guernsey’s Funds Sector (HedgeFund)
The Chinese government is so impressed by the way British island Guernsey regulates its hedge funds that it plans to replicate that system for its own funds sector. Investment Europe reported that the Shanghai Municipal Services Office has enlisted Guernsey-based firm International Administration Group to help the Chinese government better understand and regulate its private equity and hedge fund firms. Dallas hedge fund Becker Drapkin takes control of four board seats at retailer Tuesday Morning Corp. (DallasNews)
A Dallas-based hedge fund has gained control of four board seats at Tuesday Morning Corp. signaling more changes ahead following the firing last month of CEO Kathleen Mason. Becker Drapkin Management L.P. said Monday it has appointed its co-founder and partner Steven R. Becker and Navarare Corp. CEO Richard S. Willis to the retail company’s board effective immediately. The hedge fund, which owns 5.7 percent of Tuesday Morning shares, has control of two more seats. One will likely be a new chief executive officer. Becker is chairing the board’s nominating and governance committee and so will be leading the search. Blackstone Group Expands its Advisory Unit (HedgeFund)
New York-based hedge fund and private equity firm Blackstone Group has expanded its investment advisory division through the appointment of a senior executive. As the senior managing director, Jan Weidner will be based in Germany and will be responsible for the German-speaking franchise for Blackstone Advisory Partners, according to a company statement. Liquidity concerns driving multi-asset managers (MoneyManagement)
Fund-of-hedge-fund (FOHF) and multi-strategy managers are tailoring their products to provide investors with improved protection in negative markets, according to Standard & Poor’s Fund Services (S&P). According to S&P’s report on the alternative strategies/multi-asset peer group, investor demand is “inextricably tied to the performance and flight-to-liquidity issues that arose in a difficult 2011”. Factorial Management implements integrated portfolio and risk management system (Opalesque)
Hong Kong based pan-Asia multi-asset hedge fund firm Factorial Management Limited has announced the implementation of its integrated portfolio and risk management system for its flagship fund, Factorial Master Fund. Barun Agarwal, Chief Investment Officer of Factorial disclosed that the firm uses Imagine Software’s risk management solution for its system, including its core front, middle and back office system. Elliott Management sells MF Global stake-source (Reuters)
Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has resigned from a committee of MF Global Holdings Ltd creditors after selling its position in the bankrupt commodities broker, according to a source close to the matter.

Apple’s Reliance on China Just Increased (TheStreet)
Apple(AAPL) has demonstrated that it doesn’t need help selling iPads, but it still received some very beneficial news in that regard on Monday. The company finally settled its long-running dispute with Proview Technology over the iPad name in China. As part of the agreement, Apple has agreed to pay $60 million to Proview. Prop shops face start up woes (FierceFinance)
The Volcker Rule was expected to lead to a stream of prop traders leaving the bulge bracket banks to set up their own shops. That trend played out as expected for the most part. The surprise has been the outcome, as not a lot of these prop-trader-created hedge funds have panned out. Traders Magazine notes that many of these funds are now having trouble raising capital. Many ex-prop traders may have underestimated the difficulty in this endeavor. BlackRock To Buy Swiss Re Infrastructure-Investments Unit (Bloomberg)
BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, will buy Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN)’s Private Equity Partners AG for an undisclosed amount to extend its investments into infrastructure. Swiss Re’s $7.5 billion European private equity and infrastructure fund of funds unit will be integrated with BlackRock’s existing business, the New York-based firm said today in an e-mailed statement. Those funds include a “significant” commitment from Swiss Re. Money can buy you luxury (AsiaOne)
Celebrity hairstylist Addy Lee spends three weeks every month abroad, primping the coiffures of the rich and famous. But whenever the CEO of Monsoon Hair Group is in Singapore, you will find him hanging out at his swanky Sentosa Covepad. His three-room apartment sits within Singapore’s resort-playground for the rich. Nomura Dropped From DBJ Bond Sale Due To Insider Leak Case (Bloomberg)
Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604), Japan’s biggest brokerage, was dropped as a lead underwriter for state-owned Development Bank of Japan Inc.’s bond sale this month because of its involvement in leaking insider information. Nomura was replaced by Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (MS) Securities Co. on the deal, according to a faxed statement from Mizuho Securities Co. today. DBJ, which had said in May that it had hired Tokyo-based Nomura as well as Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411), today said it made the change to avoid “any disruption” to the offering. Insight: Green Mountain’s coffee distributor brews controversy (Reuters)
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the accounting practices of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is casting a spotlight on M. Block & Sons, a little-known consumer products distributor. The 18-month Green Mountain probe marks the third time in a dozen years that securities regulators have looked at the accounting practices of a company that used Chicago-based M. Block to store and help deliver its products to major retailers. Check Out Phil Falcone’s Breathtaking St. Barts Estate Mentioned In The SEC Complaint Against Him (BusinessInsider)
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a fraud suit against hedge fund billionaire Phil Falcone and his Harbinger Capital Partners. The SEC alleges that Falcone and his fund engaged in “illicit conduct that included misappropriation of client assets, market manipulation and betraying clients,” the release said. Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank buys Daiwa Global Asset Services (Opalesque)
Daiwa Securities Group Inc (“Daiwa”) has signed a sale and purchase agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (“SMTB”), to transfer its Global Asset Services Division to them. The Global Asset Services Division comprises Daiwa’s Fund Administration/ UCITs Management Company, Custodian, Trustee and Authorized Corporate Director entities domiciled in Ireland, UK and Cayman servicing clients across the globe, including the activities in Hong Kong. This transaction is subject to the customary regulatory approvals. M&A activity light in the first half of 2012 (Opalesque)
Despite a slight upswing in M&A activity in North America last quarter, overall transaction volume is down for the first half of 2012. Research from US-based financial services firm Freeman & Co. cites continued European distress and global deleveraging as causes for keeping deal volume down. The findings are corroborated by similar research released by Thompson Reuters today. Mergers and acquisitions activity was up 10% in North America last quarter after three straight quarters of decline, according to Ernst & Young’s quarterly tracker of M&A activity. Whereas overall activity was down 17% in the Eurozone countries as concerns over regional debt and tumultuous elections continue to keep money on the sidelines. SEC Freezes Assets of Missing Georgia-Based Investment Adviser (SEC)
The Securities and Exchange Commission today obtained a court order to freeze the assets of a Georgia-based investment adviser who has apparently gone into hiding after orchestrating a $40 million investment fraud. The SEC alleges that Aubrey Lee Price raised money from more than 100 investors living primarily in Georgia and Florida by selling shares in an unregistered investment fund (PFG) that he managed. Price purported to invest fund assets in traditional marketable securities, but he also made illiquid investments in South America real estate and a troubled South Georgia bank. The Daily Docket: Lehman Sells Aurora Bank (WSJ)
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said Friday it has sold its Aurora Bank FSB subsidiary, a move that should help funnel some $1.5 billion into the pockets of Lehman’s creditors.  A hedge fund manager is demanding that the trustee unwinding the brokerage of Lehman Brothers use more than $3 billion in its reserves to quickly make payments to customer claimants, saying the trustee’s “aspirational date” to pay those claims keeps slipping “further and further into the future. Hedge Fund Survey: Smarsh Report Reveals Challenges in Oversight of Electronic Communications (HedgeCo)
The survey of more than 200 compliance professionals in the hedge fund industry was conducted to better understand the attitudes and current practices for electronic communication compliance. “This year’s survey findings illuminate the shifts underway related to electronic communications compliance,” said Stephen Marsh, CEO and founder of Smarsh. “The retention and oversight of electronic communications has becoming increasingly complicated as employees are presented with a growing number of options to communicate—from instant messages and mobile devices to websites and social collaboration tools—and compliance officers must adjust quickly and comprehensively to mitigate risks to their firms.” Level Global Co-Founder, Two Others To Face Trial Together (Finalternatives)
Three accused hedge fund insider-traders will stand trial together in October. Level Global Investors co-founder Anthony Chiasson, former Diamondback Capital Management trader Todd Newman and former SAC Capital Advisors analyst Jon Horvath were arrested in January as part of the government’s ongoing insider-trading crackdown. According to federal prosecutors, the three men were part of a “criminal club” that made more than $60 million in illegal profits, including a single $53 million profit on Dell Inc. shares that is the “largest single trade ever charged in the Southern District in an insider-trading case.” Chief Executive of Barclays Resigns (NYTimes)
Robert E. Diamond Jr., the chief executive of Barclays, resigned on Tuesday, less than a week after the British bank agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it had tried to manipulate key interest rates for its own benefit. Mr. Diamond’s resignation, which was effective immediately, comes after mounting criticism of the bank’s actions from politicians and shareholders. US fines Glaxo record $3bn for mis-promoting drugs (Telegraph)
The historic penalty came as Britain’s biggest drugmaker admitted to mis-promoting two medicines, Paxil and Wellbutrin, in the US between 1998 and 2003. The settlement also saw Glaxo admit that it failed properly to report all the necessary safety data to US regulators concerning Avandia, a diabetes drug, between 2001 and 2007. The settlement ends a seven-year investigation into Glaxo’s mis-promotion of medicines in the US, which is the company’s largest research centre after Britain and home to almost a fifth of its 100,000 employees. Glaxo warned shareholders last November that it had put aside more than £2bn to pay for the settlement. Chase Carey would be News Corp CEO in a perfect world, investor says (Telegraph)
“In a perfect world we would have liked to see Chase Carey in the CEO role and Rupert move up to the chairman role,” said Kevin Holt, a senior fund manager at Invesco, News Corp’s largest shareholder after Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and the Murdoch family. “Chase Carey’s involvement in this company is very important to our ownership.” Mr Carey, who is highly regarded on Wall Street for his experience in the television business, is currently News Corp’s chief operating officer. This Is A Story About A Guy Telling A Random Dude On The Street “I’m actually building a hedge fund that uses quantitative strategies to pick stocks” And That Dude Actually Being Jim Simons (DealBreaker)
Something we’ve long-maintained around the Dealbreaker office is that hedge fund manager Jim Simons would make a great fairy godmother, what with his soothing voice, white beard, and the fact that he’s really just a lovable math teacher who happened to make a zillion dollars by tinkering away the computers in his garage and would be happy to lend the powers of his magic cigarette wand to those in need.  So we were extremely pleased to see our fantasy brought to life by way of an anecdote from Scott Patterson’s new book Dark Pools, in which Simons seems to appear out of nowhere, just like a FGM would, sprinkles unexpected gifts on a young man and woman (of both hope* and nicotine), and then disappears as quickly as he came via golden carriage. Misjudging Tennessee (WSJ)
George Soros-funded groups like Justice at Stake have been pushing to expand the so-called Missouri plan of judicial selection to new states, but so far things are moving in the opposite direction. In Tennessee, lawmakers took a huge step toward junking the system entirely when they approved a constitutional amendment in April to move the state into a modified version of the federal method. Now, the lawyers groups who have dominated the Tennessee system are getting nervous, and pulling out the … Jim Rogers Prediction: America Will Certainly Go Through A Period Of Default (GLD, SLV, IAU, AGQ, PHYS) (ETFDailyNews)
13-year host Rick Wiles and famed investor Jim Rogers of Rogers Holdings discussed many of the same topics Rogers’ is asked to update from time to time, on many programs, including the gold market, Europe’s woes, the US dollar, and the economic outlook of Asia. But Rogers ended the interview with a bang, taking on the controversial subject weighing on a growing number of Americans: Is the US headed into an extreme social/political catastrophe?  And by implication, should Americans head for the exits? Graves have their own way of touching us (ADN)
My friend Jim Rogers explains the psychological value of graves to the living this way. “A grave is a place to walk to and a place to walk away from.” This is concise way of saying — a place to pay tribute to the dead, then return to the living. With cremation now common, there are fewer graves to walk to and from. You don’t hike to the base of Mount McKinley and meditate on grandpa’s ashes scattered at 18,000 feet. I have visited cemeteries for 40 years, often as a tourist come to pay tribute. Eastman completes acquisition of Solutia (News-Journal)
Eastman Chemical Co. on Monday said it has completed its previously announced acquisition of Solutia Inc. The approximately $4.8 billion acquisition supports Eastman’s growth strategy to increase revenues and profit margins by expanding the company’s geographic reach, especially in emerging markets, and establishing a more diverse and sustainable product portfolio, according to Jim Rogers, chairman and CEO of Eastman. Carl Icahn: ‘Chesapeake Is A Very Undervalued Company’ (BusinessInsider)
Carl Icahn told CNBC that embattled natural gas giant Chesapeake Energy remains a “very undervalued company” and that he is in no way ready to sell his recently purchased 7.5 percent stake in the firm. Icahn’s interview came as Reuters reported the Justice Department had opened an inquiry into possible bid-rigging Chesapeake engaged in with Canadian company Encana over land deals in Michigan.

HedgeZ Fund Profile
































Factorial
Feeder Fund

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The Factorial Fund focuses on bottom-up analysis on sectors, companies and situations. Once it finds a compelling idea on which it has an edge, it looks across the capital structure, and plays this idea through the best risk-reward instruments. It puts in place hedges to make the portfolio largely market neutral. It also hedges out most of the macro risks, such as interest rates and currencies. The Fund also leverages the strong relationships built by the investing team over a decade of interaction with sell-side sales and bankers in both large international houses as well as small local houses which are normally overlooked but can be a source of information and local currency denominated transactions. Actual inception date is January 18, 2012. AUM is not disclosed.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

{\displaystyle 1!=1\cdot 0!=1\ .}



Other consequences that indicate defining

{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of

)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as

;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

which gives us the estimate

{\displaystyle n\ln \left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)+1\leq \ln n!\leq (n+1)\ln \left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)+1.}



Hence

{\displaystyle \ln n!\sim n\ln n}

 (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that

{\displaystyle e\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}\leq n!\leq e\left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)^{n+1}.}



It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have

{\displaystyle (n/3)^{n}<n!}

, and for all n ≥ 6 we have

{\displaystyle n!<(n/2)^{n}}

.

{\displaystyle n!\sim {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}.}

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i

∞



⌊

p

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

0

The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by

An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

t

z

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z

)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z

)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n

1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z

=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

{\displaystyle \displaystyle \log(z!)=P(z)}

 or

P
(
z
)


{\displaystyle \log(\Gamma (z\!+\!1))=P(z)}

 for any complex z ≠ 0.[citation needed] Indeed, the relation through the logarithm is valid only for specific range of values of z in vicinity of the real axis, while 




|

ℑ

Γ

z

{\displaystyle |\Im (\Gamma (z\!+\!1))|<\pi }

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

{\displaystyle |\Im (z)|>2}

 or 



ℜ

>

{\displaystyle \Re (z)>2}

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0
<
n
≤
k




n
(
(
n

)



if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:









n

Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]

Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n

{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

{\displaystyle a^{b^{c}}=a^{(b^{c})}.}

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

so that

{\displaystyle 1!=1\cdot 0!=1\ .}



Other consequences that indicate defining

{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of

⋯

)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n

(

;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}




while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property[7][8] of binomial coefficients:

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

{\displaystyle \ln n!=\sum _{x=1}^{n}\ln x.}



The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

which gives us the estimate

{\displaystyle n\ln \left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)+1\leq \ln n!\leq (n+1)\ln \left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)+1.}



Hence

{\displaystyle \ln n!\sim n\ln n}

 (see Big O notation). This result plays a key role in the analysis of the computational complexity of sorting algorithms (see comparison sort). From the bounds on ln n! deduced above we get that

n

.


{\displaystyle e\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}\leq n!\leq e\left({\frac {n+1}{e}}\right)^{n+1}.}



It is sometimes practical to use weaker but simpler estimates. Using the above formula it is easily shown that for all n we have 



(

n

{\displaystyle (n/3)^{n}<n!}

, and for all n ≥ 6 we have

n




{\displaystyle n!<(n/2)^{n}}

.




Comparison of Stirling's approximation with the factorial


For large n we get a better estimate for the number n! using Stirling's approximation:

{\displaystyle n!\sim {\sqrt {2\pi n}}\left({\frac {n}{e}}\right)^{n}.}



This in fact comes from an asymptotic series for the logarithm, and n factorial lies between this and the next approximation:

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications

×

)
×
3
)
×

×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

i




⌋



{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,








n

s

,


{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

0

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was





Γ
(
z
)
=

n

n

n

∏

k

n


(
z
+
k
)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]
For the large values of the argument, factorial can be approximated through the integral of the digamma function, using the continued fraction representation. This approach is due to T. J. Stieltjes (1894). Writing z! = exp(P(z)) where P(z) is

{\displaystyle \log(\Gamma (z\!+\!1))=P(z)}

. The larger is the real part of the argument, the smaller should be the imaginary part. However, the inverse relation, z! = exp(P(z)), is valid for the whole complex plane apart from zero. The convergence is poor in vicinity of the negative part of the real axis.[citation needed] (It is difficult to have good convergence of any approximation in vicinity of the singularities). While

 or

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0

n

k




n
(

if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:

Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that

{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers,

Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]

Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first

{\displaystyle n}

 factorials. So the superfactorial of 4 is

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula

which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.

{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).

where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example,





5
!
=
5
×
4
×
3
×
2
×
1
=
120.


{\displaystyle 5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120.}



The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1]
The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] Fabian Stedman, in 1677, described factorials as applied to change ringing.[3] After describing a recursive approach, Stedman gives a statement of a factorial (using the language of the original):

Now the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends [includes] the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;[4]

The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[5]
The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis.

so that

{\displaystyle 1!=1\cdot 0!=1\ .}



Other consequences that indicate defining 



0
!
=

{\displaystyle 0!=1}

 and the convention that the product of no numbers at all is 1 are:

There is exactly one permutation of zero objects (with nothing to permute, "everything" is left in place).
It makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all applicable sizes. The number of ways to choose 0 elements from the empty set is

.


{\displaystyle e^{x}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}.}





Factorial of a non-integer[edit]
The factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values using more advanced mathematics (the gamma function 



n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1)}

), detailed in the section below. This more generalized definition is used by advanced calculators and mathematical software such as Maple or Mathematica.
Applications[edit]
Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics.

There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects.[6][7]
Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations (subsets of k elements) from a set with n elements. One can obtain such a combination by choosing a k-permutation: successively selecting and removing an element of the set, k times, for a total of









n


k
_



=
n
(
n

)
(
n

)
⋯
(
n
−
k
+
1
)


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}




possibilities. This however produces the k-combinations in a particular order that one wishes to ignore; since each k-combination is obtained in k! different ways, the correct number of k-combinations is








n


k

k
!



=



n
(

k
(
k

)
(
k

)
⋯
(
1
)



.


{\displaystyle {\frac {n^{\underline {k}}}{k!}}={\frac {n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots (1)}}.}




This number is known[8] as the binomial coefficient 







(


n
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{k}}}

, because it is also the coefficient of Xk in (1 + X)n.


Factorials occur in algebra for various reasons, such as via the already mentioned coefficients of the binomial formula, or through averaging over permutations for symmetrization of certain operations.
Factorials also turn up in calculus; for example, they occur in the denominators of the terms of Taylor's formula,[9] where they are used as compensation terms due to the n-th derivative of xn being equivalent to n!.
Factorials are also used extensively in probability theory.[10]
Factorials can be useful to facilitate expression manipulation. For instance the number of k-permutations of n can be written as









n


k
_



=



n
!


(
n
−
k
)
!



;


{\displaystyle n^{\underline {k}}={\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}};}




while this is inefficient as a means to compute that number, it may serve to prove a symmetry property[7][8] of binomial coefficients:

Rate of growth and approximations for large n[edit]




Plot of the natural logarithm of the factorial


As n grows, the factorial n! increases faster than all polynomials and exponential functions (but slower than double exponential functions) in n.
Most approximations for n! are based on approximating its natural logarithm

The graph of the function f(n) = ln n! is shown in the figure on the right. It looks approximately linear for all reasonable values of n, but this intuition is false. We get one of the simplest approximations for ln n! by bounding the sum with an integral from above and below as follows:

which gives us the estimate

Computation[edit]
If efficiency is not a concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result fits in the variable. In functional languages, the recursive definition is often implemented directly to illustrate recursive functions.
The main practical difficulty in computing factorials is the size of the result. To assure that the exact result will fit for all legal values of even the smallest commonly used integral type (8-bit signed integers) would require more than 700 bits, so no reasonable specification of a factorial function using fixed-size types can avoid questions of overflow. The values 12! and 20! are the largest factorials that can be stored in, respectively, the 32-bit and 64-bit integers commonly used in personal computers, however in 2017 with a AMD 64 bits and 4 gigabytes RAM using Python was possible calculate 21700! with 84680 digits[12]. Floating-point representation of an approximated result allows going a bit further, but this also remains quite limited by possible overflow. Most calculators use scientific notation with 2-digit decimal exponents, and the largest factorial that fits is then 69!, because 69! < 10100 < 70!. Other implementations (e.g., computer software such as spreadsheet programs) can often handle larger values.
Most software applications will compute small factorials by direct multiplication or table lookup. Larger factorial values can be approximated using Stirling's formula. Wolfram Alpha can calculate exact results for the ceiling function and floor function applied to the binary, natural and common logarithm of n! for values of n up to 249999, and up to 20,000,000! for the integers.
If the exact values of large factorials are needed, they can be computed using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Instead of doing the sequential multiplications 



(
(
1
×
2
)
×
3
)
×
4
×
⋯


{\displaystyle ((1\times 2)\times 3)\times 4\times \cdots }

, a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.[13]
The asymptotically best efficiency is obtained by computing n! from its prime factorization. As documented by Peter Borwein, prime factorization allows n! to be computed in time O(n(log n log log n)2), provided that a fast multiplication algorithm is used (for example, the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm).[14] Peter Luschny presents source code and benchmarks for several efficient factorial algorithms, with or without the use of a prime sieve.[15]
Number theory[edit]
Factorials have many applications in number theory. In particular, n! is necessarily divisible by all prime numbers up to and including n. As a consequence, n > 5 is a composite number if and only if





(
n
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
0


(
mod

n
)

.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!\ \equiv \ 0{\pmod {n}}.}



A stronger result is Wilson's theorem, which states that





(
p
−
1
)
!
 
≡
 
−
1


(
mod

p
)



{\displaystyle (p-1)!\ \equiv \ -1{\pmod {p}}}



if and only if p is prime.[16][17]
Legendre's formula gives the multiplicity of the prime p occurring in the prime factorization of 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 as






∑

i
=
1


∞



⌊


n

p

i




⌋



{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{p^{i}}}\right\rfloor }



or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle {\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}},}



where 




s

p


(
n
)


{\displaystyle s_{p}(n)}

 denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of n.
Adding 1 to a factorial n! yields a number that is divisible by a prime larger than n. This fact can be used to prove Euclid's theorem that the number of primes is infinite.[18] Primes of the form n! ± 1 are called factorial primes.
Series of reciprocals[edit]
The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series whose sum is Euler's number e:

Although the sum of this series is an irrational number, it is possible to multiply the factorials by positive integers to produce a convergent series with a rational sum:






∑

n

0

{\displaystyle \sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{(n+2)n!}}={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{30}}+{\frac {1}{144}}+\cdots =1\,.}



The convergence of this series to 1 can be seen from the fact that its partial sums are less than one by an inverse factorial. Therefore, the factorials do not form an irrationality sequence.[19]
Extension of factorial to non-integer values of argument[edit]
The Gamma and Pi functions[edit]
Main article: Gamma function




The factorial function, generalized to all real numbers except negative integers. For example, 0! = 1! = 1, (−0.5)! = √π, (0.5)! = √π/2.


Besides nonnegative integers, the factorial function can also be defined for non-integer values, but this requires more advanced tools from mathematical analysis. One function that "fills in" the values of the factorial (but with a shift of 1 in the argument) is called the Gamma function, denoted Γ(z), defined for all complex numbers z except the non-positive integers, and given when the real part of z is positive by





Γ
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z
−
1



e

−
t




d

t
.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t.}



Its relation to the factorials is that for any natural number n





n
!
=
Γ
(
n
+
1
)
.


{\displaystyle n!=\Gamma (n+1).}



Euler's original formula for the Gamma function was

∏

n


(
z

k
)



.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\lim _{n\to \infty }{\frac {n^{z}n!}{\displaystyle \prod _{k=0}^{n}(z+k)}}.}



An alternative notation, originally introduced by Gauss, is sometimes used. The Pi function, denoted Π(z) for real numbers z no less than 0, is defined by





Π
(
z
)
=

∫

0


∞



t

z



e

−
t




d

t

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }t^{z}e^{-t}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}



In terms of the Gamma function it is





Π
(
z
)
=
Γ
(
z
+
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=\Gamma (z+1)\,.}



It truly extends the factorial in that





Π
(
n
)
=
n
!

 for 

n
∈

N


.


{\displaystyle \Pi (n)=n!{\text{ for }}n\in \mathbf {N} \,.}



In addition to this, the Pi function satisfies the same recurrence as factorials do, but at every complex value z where it is defined





Π
(
z
)
=
z
Π
(
z
−
1
)

.


{\displaystyle \Pi (z)=z\Pi (z-1)\,.}



In fact, this is no longer a recurrence relation but a functional equation. Expressed in terms of the Gamma function this functional equation takes the form





Γ
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
Γ
(
n
)

.


{\displaystyle \Gamma (n+1)=n\Gamma (n)\,.}



Since the factorial is extended by the Pi function, for every complex value z where it is defined, we can write:





z
!
=
Π
(
z
)


{\displaystyle z!=\Pi (z)}



The values of these functions at half-integer values is therefore determined by a single one of them; one has

The Pi function is certainly not the only way to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even the only one that is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n + 1) = nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n) = nΠ(n − 1) functional equation.
However, there exist complex functions that are probably simpler in the sense of analytic function theory and which interpolate the factorial values. For example, Hadamard's 'Gamma'-function (Hadamard 1894) which, unlike the Gamma function, is an entire function.[20]
Euler also developed a convergent product approximation for the non-integer factorials, which can be seen to be equivalent to the formula for the Gamma function above:

However, this formula does not provide a practical means of computing the Pi or Gamma function, as its rate of convergence is slow.

Approximations of factorial[edit]

, the 6 coefficients above are sufficient for the evaluation of the factorial with the complex<double> precision. For higher precision more coefficients can be computed by a rational QD-scheme (H. Rutishauser's QD algorithm).[22]
Non-extendability to negative integers[edit]
The relation n! = n × (n − 1)! allows one to compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a smaller integer. The relation can be inverted so that one can compute the factorial for an integer given the factorial for a larger integer:





(
n
−
1
)
!
=



n
!

n


.


{\displaystyle (n-1)!={\frac {n!}{n}}.}



Note, however, that this recursion does not permit us to compute the factorial of a negative integer; use of the formula to compute (−1)! would require a division by zero, and thus blocks us from computing a factorial value for every negative integer. (Similarly, the Gamma function is not defined for non-positive integers, though it is defined for all other complex numbers.)
Factorial-like products and functions[edit]
There are several other integer sequences similar to the factorial that are used in mathematics:
Double factorial[edit]
Main article: Double factorial
The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer n is called the double factorial of n, and denoted by n!!.[23] That is,

{\displaystyle (2k-1)!!=\prod _{i=1}^{k}(2i-1)={\frac {(2k)!}{2^{k}k!}}={\frac {_{2k}P_{k}}{2^{k}}}={\frac {{(2k)}^{\underline {k}}}{2^{k}}}.}



For example, 9!! = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 = 945.
The sequence of double factorials for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... starts as

1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395, 135135, .... (sequence A001147 in the OEIS)

Double factorial notation may be used to simplify the expression of certain trigonometric integrals,[24] to provide an expression for the values of the Gamma function at half-integer arguments and the volume of hyperspheres,[25] and to solve many counting problems in combinatorics including counting binary trees with labeled leaves and perfect matchings in complete graphs.[23][26]
Multifactorials[edit]
A common related notation is to use multiple exclamation points to denote a multifactorial, the product of integers in steps of two (



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

), three (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

), or more (see generalizations of the double factorial). The double factorial is the most commonly used variant, but one can similarly define the triple factorial (



n
!
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!!}

) and so on. One can define the k-th factorial, denoted by 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

, recursively for positive integers as





n

!

(
k
)


=


{



n



if 

0
<
n
≤
k




n
(
(
n

!

(

)



if 

n
>
k








{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}={\begin{cases}n&{\text{if }}0<n\leq k\\n((n-k)!^{(k)})&{\text{if }}n>k\end{cases}}}



though see the alternative definition below. In addition, similarly to 0! = 1!/1 = 1, one can define:





n

!

(
k
)


=
1
 

if 

−
k
<
n
≤
0


{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}=1\ {\text{if }}-k<n\leq 0}



For sufficiently large 



n
≥
1


{\displaystyle n\geq 1}

, the ordinary single factorial function is expanded through the multifactorial functions as follows:









n
!



=
n
!
!
⋅

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}n!&=n!!\cdot (n-1)!!,\ n\geq 1\\&=n!!!\cdot (n-1)!!!\cdot (n-2)!!!,\ n\geq 2\\&=\prod _{i=0}^{k-1}(n-i)!^{(k)},\ {\text{ for }}k\in \mathbb {Z} ^{+},n\geq k-1.\end{aligned}}}



Some mathematicians have suggested an alternative notation of 



n

!

2




{\displaystyle n!_{2}}

 for the double factorial and similarly 



n

!

k




{\displaystyle n!_{k}}

 for other multifactorials, but this has not come into general use. Another common notation is to place the 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 parameter as a subscript as 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!_{(k)}}

 to denote the multifactorials defined above.
In the same way that 



n
!


{\displaystyle n!}

 is not defined for negative integers, and 



n
!
!


{\displaystyle n!!}

 is not defined for negative even integers, 



n

!

(
k
)




{\displaystyle n!^{(k)}}

 is not defined for negative integers divisible by 



k


{\displaystyle k}

.
Primorial[edit]
The primorial (sequence A002110 in the OEIS) is similar to the factorial, but with the product taken only over the prime numbers.
Superfactorial[edit]
Main article: Large numbers
"N$" redirects here. For the currency, see Namibian dollar.
Neil Sloane and Simon Plouffe defined a superfactorial in The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Academic Press, 1995) to be the product of the first 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 factorials. So the superfactorial of 4 is





sf
⁡
(

{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (4)=1!\times 2!\times 3!\times 4!=288.}

Equivalently, the superfactorial is given by the formula





sf
⁡
(
n
)
=

∏

0

j

n


(
j

)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {sf} (n)=\prod _{0\leq i<j\leq n}(j-i)}



which is the determinant of a Vandermonde matrix.
The sequence of superfactorials starts (from 



n
=
0


{\displaystyle n=0}

) as

1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560, 24883200, 125411328000, ... (sequence A000178 in the OEIS)

Alternative definition[edit]

Clifford Pickover in his 1995 book Keys to Infinity used a new notation, n$, to define the superfactorial

or as,

[
4

n

{\displaystyle n\$=n![4]n!}



where the [4] notation denotes the hyper4 operator, or using Knuth's up-arrow notation,





n
$

(

.


{\displaystyle n\$=(n!)\uparrow \uparrow (n!).}

{\displaystyle 3\$=6[4]6={^{6}}6=6^{6^{6^{6^{6^{6}}}}}.}



Here, as is usual for compound exponentiation, the grouping is understood to be from right to left:






a


b

c




=

a

(

b

)


.


{\displaystyle a^{b^{c}}=a^{(b^{c})}.}



Hyperfactorial[edit]
Occasionally the hyperfactorial of n is considered. It is written as H(n) and defined by

{\displaystyle H(n)=\prod _{k=1}^{n}k^{k}=1^{1}\cdot 2^{2}\cdot 3^{3}\cdots (n-1)^{n-1}\cdot n^{n}.}



For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... the values H(n) are 1, 4, 108, 27648,... (sequence A002109 in the OEIS).
The asymptotic growth rate is

{\displaystyle H(n)\sim An^{(6n^{2}+6n+1)/12}e^{-n^{2}/4}}



where A = 1.2824... is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.[27] H(14) = 1.8474...×1099 is already almost equal to a googol, and H(15) = 8.0896...×10116 is almost of the same magnitude as the Shannon number, the theoretical number of possible chess games. Compared to the Pickover definition of the superfactorial, the hyperfactorial grows relatively slowly.
The hyperfactorial function can be generalized to complex numbers in a similar way as the factorial function. The resulting function is called the K-function.

attention to our use of the factorial operator and videos on
permutations and combinations. You may or may not have noticed something
that might be interesting. So let's just review factorial a little
bit. So if I were to say n factorial, that of
course is going to be n times n minus one times n minus two. And I would just keep going down, until I
go to times one. So I'd keep decrementing n until I get
to one and then I would multiply all of those things together. So for example:
if I were to say three factorial: that's going to be three times
two times one. If I were to say two factorial: that's
going to be two times one. One factorial: well I just keep
decrementing until I get to one but I don't even have to decrement here
I'm already at one. So I just multiply one. Now what about zero factorial?
This is interesting, zero factorial. So one logical thing is to say:
"Oh hey you know maybe zero factorial is zero." I'm just starting with itself, it's
already below one, and maybe it is zero. Now what we will see is that this is not
the case, that mathematics and mathematicians have decided. Remember this is what's interesting that
the factorial operation is something that humans have invented. That they think it's just an interesting
thing, it's a useful notation. So they can define what it does,
and mathematicians have found it far more useful to define zero factorial as
something else. To define zero factorial as -- and there's
a little drum roll here... They believe zero factorial should be one,
and I know, based on the reasoning, the conceptional reasoning of this, this
doesn't make any sense. But since we've already been exposed to a
little bit to permutation I'll show you why this is a useful concept, especially
in the world of permutations and combinations,
which is frankly where factorial shows up the most. Most of the cases that I've ever seen
factorial in anything has been in situations of combinations
& permutations, and in a few other things but mainly permutations and combinations. So let's review a little bit, we've said
if we have n things and we want to figure out the number of ways to permute
them into k spaces it's going to be n factorial over n minus k factorial. Now we've also said that if we had
n things that we wanna permute into n places, well this really should just be
n factorial, the first place has -- Let's do this, so this is the first place,
this is the second place, this is the third place, all the way
you get to the nth place. Well there would be n possibilities for
who's in the first position or which object is in the first position,
and for each of those possibilities there would be n minus one possibilities
for which object you choose to put in the second position.
Because we've already put one into that position. Now for each of these n times n minus one
possibilities where you've placed two things, there would be n minus
two possibilities of what goes in the third position, and then you would
just go all the way down to one. This thing right over here is
exactly what we wrote over here. This is equal to n factorial, but if we
directly apply this formula this would need to be n factorial
over n minus n factorial, and then you might see why this is
interesting, because this is going to be n factorial over zero factorial. So in order for this formula to apply even
in the case where k is equal to n, which is this one right over here, and
for that to be consistent with just plain old logic, zero factorial needs to be
equal to one. And so the mathematics community has
decided "hey this thing we've constructed called factorial, you know we set an
exclamation mark behind something and in all of our heads we say that you kind of
count down that number all the way to one and you
keep multiplying them. For zero, we're just gonna define this,
make a mathematical definition. We're just gonna say zero factorial is
equal to one." And it's actually quite useful.Possible three letter wordsWays to arrange colorsUp NextWays to arrange colors

around that round table. This is one chair right over here, this is another chair, and that is another chair. We can number the chairs; that is chair one, that is chair two, and that is chair three. Now let's assume that
there are three people who want to sit in these three chairs, so there is Person A, there is Person B, and there is Person C. What we want to do is we want to count the number of ways that these three people can sit in these three chairs. What do I mean by that? Well, if A sits in chair
one, B sits in chair three, and C sits in chair two, that is one scenario right over there. So this is one of the possible scenarios, A in seat one, C in seat
two, B in seat three. Another scenario could be B in seat one, maybe C still sits in seat
two, C still sits there, and now A would be in seat three. So this is one scenario and two scenarios. My question to you is how many scenarios are there like this? I encourage you to pause the video and try to think through it. I'm assuming you've had a go at it, now let's work through it together. I want to do it very systematically so that we don't forget
any of the scenarios. The way I'm going to
do it is, I'm going to create three blanks that
represent each of the chairs. So here, it's in a circle,
but we could just say that blank is chair one,
that's the blank for chair two, and that is the blank for chair three. I'm going to start with seat
one, and I'm going to say, "Well, what are the different scenarios?" A could sit there, B could
sit there, C could sit there. Then for each of those, figure
out who could sit in seat two and then for each of those, figure out who could sit in seat three. So let's do that. First, what are the scenarios
of who could sit in seat one? Maybe I'll write it this way, maybe I'll do seat one. So right now, we're only
going to fill seat one. Well A could sit in seat one, in which case we haven't filled
seat two or seat three yet. So that's two or three. B could sit in seat one,
and we haven't figured out who sits in seat two or seat three yet. Then we could have C sitting in seat one, and we still have to figure
out who's going to sit in seat two and seat three. For each of these, let's figure out who could be sitting in seat two. So, seats one and two. For this one right over here, we have A in seat one for sure. We could either have
B sitting in seat two, in which case, I'll leave this
blank although you can use a little bit of deductive
reasoning to figure out who's going to be sitting in seat three. So I'll leave seat three blank. Or, you could have C sitting in seat two. We still haven't figured out
who's sitting in seat three, although once again, a little bit of deductive reasoning might tell us. So these are the scenarios
where A is in seat one. Now what about when B is in seat one? We could put A in seat two, and we still need to figure out who's in seat three. Or, we could put C in seat two, and we still need to figure out who's going to be in seat three. Finally, let's look at C,
where C is in seat one. You could either put A in seat two or you could put B in seat two. Now let's fill out all three of the seats. So seats one, two, and three. For this scenario right over here, there's only one option that
you could put in seat three, the only person who hasn't
sat down yet is person C. So this will be A, B, C. And what would this be? The only person who hasn't sat down in this scenario yet to fill this chair, the only option for this chair, there's only one option here, it's going to be person B. It's A, C, B. This one is going to be B, A, C. C's the only person who could sit there, A is the only person who could sit there. B, C, A. And then here, B is the only person who could sit in seat three. And here A is the only person who could sit in seat three. How many scenarios do we have? We have one, two, three, four, five, and six. And six is our answer. That's the number of
scenarios that you could have the different people sitting
in the different chairs. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Okay Sal, this was a
scenario with three people "and three chairs and I
might've been able just do this "even if I didn't do it systematically. "But what if I have many many more chairs? "What if I had 60 chairs?" Well, the number of scenarios
would get fairly large. What if I had five people and five chairs? Even this method right over here would take up a lot of paper space, or a lot of screen space. What do we do in that scenario? And the realization here is just thinking about what happened here. How many people could sit in seat one? If we're going seat by seat, how many possibilities were there to put in seat one? If you're seating in order, if you haven't filled
any of the seats yet, right at the beginning,
there's three possible people who could sit in seat one. You see it right over here, one two, three, because there's
three possible people. For each of those, how many
people could sit in seat two? For each of them, let's
say the scenario where A is sitting in seat one,
there's two possibilities for who could sit in seat two. Let me do this in a different color. So this, right over here. For each of these three,
there's two possibilities of who could sit in seat two. If A is sitting in seat
one, you could have either B or C in seat two. If B is sitting in seat one, you have either A or C for seat two. So for each of these three,
you have two possibilities of who could sit in seat two. So you have six possibilities
where you're filling in three times two, or you're filling in the scenarios for seats one and two. And then for each of those, how many scenarios are
who can sit in seat three? For each of those, there was only one possibility for who could sit in seat three. We see it right there, that's because there's only one person left
who hasn't sat down yet. So how many total possibilities are there? Well, three times two
times one is equal to six. And so if we were to do that
same exact thought exercise, with say, five seats, let's
go through that exercise. It's interesting. So if we have one, two, three, four, five. So this is five seats with
five people sitting down, and we want to figure out
how many scenarios are there for all the different people
and all the different seats. For the first seat, there's five different people who could sit in it. For each of those scenarios,
there's four people who haven't sat down yet who
could sit in the second seat. For each of those scenarios,
there's going to be three people who haven't sat down yet, so those are the people who
could sit in the third seat if we're filling out
the seats in this order. For each of all of these scenarios, there's two people left
who haven't sat down yet, who could sit in the fourth seat. And then for all of these scenarios, there's only one person
left who hasn't sat down who would have to sit in the fifth seat. If you had this exact
same thing, but instead of three chairs you had five chairs, the number of scenarios would be five times four times
three times two times one. Which is what, 20 times six, which is equal to 120 scenarios. And so you see that the
scenarios grow fairly quickly. And if you're wondering,
"Hey, this is kind of a neat mathematical thing. Three
times two times one." Or five times four times
three times two times one. If you start with a number
and you multiply that number times number one less than that all the way down to getting to one, that seems like neat kind of
fun mathematical operation. And lucky for you, or
maybe unlucky for you, because this might have
been your chance at fame, this operation has already been defined. It's called the factorial operation. So this thing right over here, this is the same thing as three factorial. You write this little exclamation mark. This right over here,
this is the same thing as five factorial. In general, if I said six factorial, that would be equal to six times five times four times three
times two times one. Hopefully you enjoyed that.Permutation formulaUp NextPermutation formula
