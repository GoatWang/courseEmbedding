The increase in room revenues was primarily due to a 0.8% increase in ADR as well as a 90 bps increase in occupancy, resulting in a 2.1% increase in RevPAR. These increases were primarily a result of a shift in our customer mix to a greater number of high yield, shorter-stay business and leisure guests, the collective impact of our hotel renovation program and focus on service excellence.  Income tax expense. Our effective income tax rate increased by approximately 5.4 percentage points to approximately 21.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to approximately 16.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due to ESH REIT's status as a REIT under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") during these periods. During the three months ended March 31, 2016 the Company recognized a benefit of approximately $0.3 million related to current payable adjustments and a benefit of approximately $1.7 million with respect to the reversal of net deferred tax liabilities which related to the previously estimated 5% of taxable income expected to be retained under ESH REIT's prior 95% distribution policy, which was changed during the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Business Wire




May 1, 2015 11:42 AM EDT













 




























































  Extended Stay America, Inc.'s (NYSE:STAY) (the "Company") subsidiary, ESH Hospitality, Inc., today announced that it has priced the previously announced offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The Notes will have an interest rate of 5.25% per annum and will be issued at a price equal to 100% of their face value. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2025.  ESH Hospitality, Inc. will use substantially all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under a mortgage loan.  The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis by certain of ESH Hospitality, Inc.'s subsidiaries.  The notes will be offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the U.S. pursuant to Rule 144A and outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  The sale of the Notes is expected to be consummated on May 15, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions.  The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.  This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Notes or any other securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.   Forward Looking Statements   This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements related to, among other things, the consummation of the offering and potential changes in market conditions constitute forward-looking statements. For a description of factors that may cause the Company's and ESH Hospitality, Inc.'s actual results, performance or expectations to differ from any forward-looking statements, please review the information under the headings "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" included in the Company's and ESH Hospitality, Inc.'s combined annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2015 and other documents of the Company and ESH Hospitality, Inc. on file with or furnished to the SEC. Any forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company and ESH Hospitality, Inc. will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, the Company and ESH Hospitality, Inc. or its business or operations. Except as required by law, the Company and ESH Hospitality, Inc. undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted by the Company's and ESH Hospitality, Inc.'s forward-looking statements.

Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On
December 7, 2016, Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality,
Inc. (together, the “Company”) entered into a share
repurchase agreement (the “Share Repurchase Agreement”)
with the Selling Stockholders (as defined below) pursuant to which
they intend to repurchase, directly from the Selling Stockholders,
625,000 Paired Shares, each Paired Share consisting of a share of
common stock of Extended Stay America, Inc. and a share of Class B
common stock of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are attached and trade
together as Paired Shares. The share repurchase will be effected in
a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal
to the price paid by the underwriter in the offering (as defined
below). Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc.
expect to fund the share repurchase from cash on hand. The share
repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the
offering. Although the completion of the share repurchase will be
conditioned upon the closing of the offering, the closing of the
offering will not be conditioned upon the closing of the share
repurchase. The share repurchase has been approved by the audit
committees of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc.
and is pursuant to, and will count toward, the Company’s
existing combined Paired Share repurchase program. The foregoing
description of the Share Repurchase Agreement does not purport to
be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the Share Repurchase Agreement, which is filed as
Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  

Item 8.01
Other Events.

On
December 12, 2016, the Company issued a press release which
announced the pricing of the underwritten secondary offering (the
“offering”) of 12,500,000 Paired Shares. The Paired
Shares were offered by certain entities affiliated with
Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson & Co. Inc. and The
Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Selling Stockholders”),
which is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately
$206,250,000. The offering is expected to close on December 16,
2016, subject to customary closing conditions.

The
Company will not sell any Paired Shares in the offering and will
not receive any proceeds from the offering. In addition, none of
the Company’s officers or directors are selling any Paired
Shares beneficially owned by them in the offering.

A copy of
the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Stock ”) and one share of Class B common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of ESH REIT (the “ Class B
Common Stock ”), which are attached and trade
together. These paired shares are collectively referred to as the
“ Shares ” in this Agreement;

WHEREAS,
the Companies and the Sellers propose to enter into a transaction
(the “ Repurchase Transaction ”) whereby
the Sellers shall sell to the Companies and the Companies shall
purchase from the Sellers a number of Shares (the “

nearest whole Share), as set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS,
the Corporation will purchase shares of Corporation Common Stock
(its portion of the Repurchase Shares) and pay its portion (the
“ Corporation Proportion ”) of the Per
Share Purchase Price, with such portion being determined by
reference to the proportionate amount of the aggregate valuation of
the Shares that was attributable to the Corporation Common Stock in
connection with the most recent third party valuation of the fair
market value of the Shares performed before the Secondary
Offering;

WHEREAS,
ESH REIT will purchase shares of Class B Common Stock (its portion
of the Repurchase Shares) and pay its portion (the “
ESH REIT Proportion ”) of the Per Share
Purchase Price, with such portion being determined by reference to
the proportionate amount of the aggregate valuation of the Shares
that was attributable to the Class B Common Stock in connection
with the most recent third party valuation of the fair market value
of the Shares performed before the Secondary Offering;

WHEREAS,
the Sellers propose to sell through an underwritten public offering
(the “ Secondary Offering ”) registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “
SEC ”) certain other Shares owned by the
Sellers (the “ Secondary Shares
”);

NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, of the mutual

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
