James M. Jenness

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James M. Jenness (born 1946) is the chairman of the board and former CEO of the Kellogg Company, succeeding Carlos Gutierrez after President George W. Bush nominated Gutierrez to become Secretary of Commerce on November 29, 2004. Jenness was CEO until December 31, 2006, when he was succeeded by David MacKay.[1]
A native of Chicago, Illinois, Jenness received a bachelor's degree in marketing and an MBA from DePaul University. He was a long-time employee of the Leo Burnett advertising agency, eventually becoming vice-chairman and chief operating officer. In 1997, Jenness left Leo Burnett to become CEO of the retail consultancy Integrated Merchandising Systems in Chicago. He resigned as its CEO upon being named CEO at Kellogg.
Although regarded by some as an outsider to Kellogg, Jenness has had a long association with the company. His first assignment at Leo Burnett in 1974 was an advertising campaign for the Special K brand of cereal. Since then, he worked on campaigns for most of Kellogg's brands. He was named to Kellogg's board of directors in July 2000.

James M. Jenness - Wikipedia





















 






James M. Jenness

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James M. Jenness (born 1946) is the chairman of the board and former CEO of the Kellogg Company, succeeding Carlos Gutierrez after President George W. Bush nominated Gutierrez to become Secretary of Commerce on November 29, 2004. Jenness was CEO until December 31, 2006, when he was succeeded by David MacKay.[1]
A native of Chicago, Illinois, Jenness received a bachelor's degree in marketing and an MBA from DePaul University. He was a long-time employee of the Leo Burnett advertising agency, eventually becoming vice-chairman and chief operating officer. In 1997, Jenness left Leo Burnett to become CEO of the retail consultancy Integrated Merchandising Systems in Chicago. He resigned as its CEO upon being named CEO at Kellogg.
Although regarded by some as an outsider to Kellogg, Jenness has had a long association with the company. His first assignment at Leo Burnett in 1974 was an advertising campaign for the Special K brand of cereal. Since then, he worked on campaigns for most of Kellogg's brands. He was named to Kellogg's board of directors in July 2000.

James Jenness Elected to Chair DePaul University’s Board of Trustees

Kellogg Co. Chairman James M. Jenness (COM ’69, MBA 71), a devoted DePaul University alumnus who has remained engaged with his alma mater in a variety of capacities, has been elected to chair DePaul’s Board of Trustees. Jenness, 65, who joined the board in 2002 and has been its vice chair, succeeds Chicago Library Commissioner Mary Dempsey, who completed her three-year term.
“I love DePaul,” Jenness said. “The education and values I received here have been the biggest enablers of my life. DePaul opened possibilities I never dreamed of growing up on the South Side of Chicago.”
The Rev. Dennis H. Holtschneider, C.M., DePaul’s president, respects the experience and perspective Jenness brings to his new role. “Jim understands what it means to be a part of a great company and has distinguished himself on both corporate and nonprofit boards for many years. Most important, he understands how significant DePaul is to Chicago. I’m proud to be working with him.”
Jenness, who also previously served as Kellogg’s CEO, is one of four trustees who oversee the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust, one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations. His association with Kellogg, the world’s largest cereal maker, dates back to 1974.
Jenness is involved in wide-ranging civic and philanthropic interests. He serves on the boards of Kimberly-Clark Corp., the Schwarz Paper Co., Children’s Memorial Hospital and the Mercy Home for Boys and Girls.
Jenness received his bachelor’s degree (cum laude) in marketing from DePaul in 1969 and his MBA, also from DePaul, in 1971. He was awarded a doctor of humane letters from DePaul in 2006, and he has been a member and chairman of the College of Commerce Advisory Council. In 1995, he received the College of Commerce Alumni Award of Merit and currently serves on the trustee steering committee of DePaul’s Many Dreams, One Mission fundraising campaign.
Jenness is an accomplished long-distance runner, having run in the Chicago Marathon each of the past 20 years and often participating alongside DePaul faculty and staff in many other races and marathons. Fr. Holtschneider observed, “I suspect this means I’ll be getting in better shape.”

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
