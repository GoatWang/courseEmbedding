Wynnefield Capital, Inc. (WCI) is a value investor, specializing in U.S. small cap situations that have a company or industry specific catalyst(s). Surfacing of these catalysts unlocks existing, but previously unrecognized value for shareholders. WCI maintains an active investment philosophy. We are not involved in "Greenmail" situations, but focus on initiatives with management and outside directors to release value. 
We seek out under-followed, unrecognized and undervalued companies that fit our parameters which include minimal balance sheet risk and potential for micro or macro change. WCI adds value by uncovering both long and short opportunities through in-depth original research. The investment manager holds core positions about 6-8 years, turning the portfolio approximately 25% per year, providing its limited partners the benefit of tax efficient returns.
WCI was established in 1992. Our founding partners, Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes, held senior research and institutional equity positions at Lazard Freres & Co. Among the initial Wynnefield investors were Nelson's and Joshua's colleagues at Lazard.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include

                  Wynnefield Capital (WC) is a value investor that specializes in investments in US small-cap situations that have company or industry specific catalysts. The firm employs an active investment philosophy. They are not involved in Greenmail situations, but focus on initiatives with management and outside directors to release value.The firm seeks to invest in underfollowed, unrecognized and undervalued companies that fit their parameters. They look for companies with minimal balance sheet risk and the potential for micro or macro change. WC adds value by uncovering both long and short opportunities through original research. They are tax-conscious investors and generally maintain portfolio positions for 24 to 36 months. Catalytic factors they consider include a balance sheet with little or rapidly decreasing debt, changes in governmental regulation, scale-driven industry consolidation and management succession issues or situations where management compensation is related directly to creation of shareholder value and shareholder friendly board of directors. They also consider insider buying and turnaround situations where changes in the structure of a business improve focus on shareholder value.WC maintains a proactive posture with respect to their portfolio names when they believe management is not responding appropriately to surface shareholder value, where corporate governance issues exist or where outside assistance can be provided to a management working to implement value-creating strategies.  In numerous cases, they are forms 13-D and 4 filers and have, in rare circumstances, accepted a board of director's seat.The firm seeks to provide hedged returns, not only through individual securities, but also by using index futures when their research indicates systemic market or sector, risk. WC looks for overextended valuations relative to earnings potential, increasing balance sheet risk, unfavorable marketplace changes for a company's products, management instability, extreme speculative market moves or the emergence of deteriorating industry macros.WC is an activist firm and is included in the SharkWatch50 as one the 50 most prominent activist investors.

Wynnefield Capital, Inc., is an employee-owned hedge fund founded in 1992 by Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes. The fund is a value investor, specializing in U.S. small-cap companies with a business- or industry-specific catalyst. It employs long and short strategies and conducts in-house research in making its investments.[1][2] The fund has been an activist investor[3] with a number of companies, including Cornell Companies,[4] Crown Crafts,[5] Breeze-Eastern,[6] MAM Software,[7] Chiquita Brands,[8] and Omega Protein.[9]
Wynnefield Capital is based in New York City and is named after Nelson Obus’ and Landes’ childhood neighborhood of Wynnefield in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[3]
In May 2014, after a 12-year battle, Nelson Obus and a Wynnefield analyst were exonerated of all insider trading accusations made by the SEC in a trial by jury.[10][11][12][13][14] Nelson Obus has been an outspoken critic of the SEC[15] and penned an op-ed on regulatory overreach for The Wall Street Journal.[16]
Founders: Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes[edit]
Prior to founding Wynnefield, Nelson Obus and Landes both held senior research equity positions at Lazard Feres & Co.[2] Nelson Obus currently serves on the Board of Directors for Zionist Organization of America,[17] Layne Christensen Co.,[18] MK Acquisition LLC, and the Princeton Historical Society.[19] Obus also serves on the Board of Advisors of the Bank of Princeton,[20] the Appalachian Mountain Club,[21] and the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association.[22] He previously served on the Boards of Directors of Breeze-Eastern Corporation and Underground Solutions, Inc.[2]
Landes is a member of the Board of Trustees of S.A.R. Academy in Riverdale, New York;[23] Board of Directors of Ken's Krew[24] and the Zionist Organization of America,[17] and the Vice President of the American Jewish Historical Society.[25] Landes led the financing efforts for the creation of a statue commemorating Uriah P. Levy, the first Jewish admiral to serve in the U.S. Navy.[26]

Wynnefield Capital, Inc. (WCI) is a value investor, specializing in U.S. small cap situations that have a company or industry specific catalyst(s). Surfacing of these catalysts unlocks existing, but previously unrecognized value for shareholders. WCI maintains an active investment philosophy. We are not involved in "Greenmail" situations, but focus on initiatives with management and outside directors to release value. 
We seek out under-followed, unrecognized and undervalued companies that fit our parameters which include minimal balance sheet risk and potential for micro or macro change. WCI adds value by uncovering both long and short opportunities through in-depth original research. The investment manager holds core positions about 6-8 years, turning the portfolio approximately 25% per year, providing its limited partners the benefit of tax efficient returns.
WCI was established in 1992. Our founding partners, Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes, held senior research and institutional equity positions at Lazard Freres & Co. Among the initial Wynnefield investors were Nelson's and Joshua's colleagues at Lazard.
