The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

ToolsLet Us Recommend Your Investment PortfolioLearn MoreUSAA Capital Growth Fund FactsUSAA Capital Growth FundPeriod Ending March 31, 2017The first quarter of 2017 largely extended the so-called "Trump rally" that began at the end of last year, with steady equity gains tapering off after mid-March. Most major economies, including the Eurozone and the United States, saw solid growth throughout the period. Germany, Italy, and Taiwan hit five-year highs in manufacturing. The positive trends prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve to continue to modestly raise rates, and to set expectations for two more rate hikes in 2017. The top-performing regional segment in the benchmark was Developed Asia (excluding Japan), with a double-digit return. Of the major regions, Continental Europe saw the strongest returns. Most European countries performed well, led by Spain and the Netherlands. In the United States, results were in line with the global markets as U.S. employment data was strong. The UK was also up for the quarter, strongly led by consumer staples. Lastly, while Japan's GDP grew at a slower pace than expected and the country lagged among the major regions, numerous indicators were positive, including the country's largest trade surplus in seven years.Against this backdrop, the USAA Capital Growth Fund performed well during the quarter. (Fund performance for the quarter and various other time periods, as well as respective fund expenses, can be viewed by clicking here.)Our most recent quarterly update can be viewed here. As always, investors should maintain a long-term perspective while making investment decisions based on their time horizon, investment goals, and risk tolerance, not the day-to-day movements of the financial markets that are impossible to predict.

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Texas-based Fortune 500[4] diversified financial services group of companies[5] including a Texas Department of Insurance regulated[6] reciprocal inter-insurance exchange and subsidiaries offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families that serve, or served, in the United States military. At the end of 2016, there were 11.9 million members.[7]
USAA was founded in 1922 in San Antonio, Texas by a group of 25 U.S. Army officers[8] as a mechanism for mutual self-insurance when they were unable to secure auto insurance because of the perception that they, as military officers, were a high-risk group.[9] USAA has since expanded to offer banking and insurance services to past and present members of the Armed Forces, officers and enlisted, and their immediate families.
The company was one of the pioneers of direct marketing and most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees[citation needed] instead of agents.

History[edit]
The organization was originally called the United States Army Automobile Association. In 1924, the name was changed to United Services Automobile Association, when commissioned officers of other U.S. military services became eligible for membership. The company opened offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and London, England early in its history. The company was formed based on a meeting of twenty five United States Army Officers on June 22, 1922 at the Gunter Hotel to discuss the procurement of reliable and economical auto insurance.
USAA is headquartered in northwest San Antonio, Texas, occupying 286 acres (116 ha) (a former horse farm)[10] in the largest single-occupancy office building in the world, exceeding the size of The Pentagon.[11]
USAA is a pioneer of the concept of direct marketing; most of its business is conducted over the Internet or telephone using employees instead of agents. Until the 1960s the bulk of its business was conducted via mail. In the late 1960s, USAA began a transition from mail to phone-based sales and service. A toll-free number was launched in 1978, and Internet sales and service were launched in 1999 via its website.
The organization started offering homeowner's and life insurance in the 1960s, and brokerage and investment management services in the 1970s, and banking services in the 1980s.
USAA offered restricted membership to civilians between September 2009 and August 2013. This membership provided access to USAA’s investment products, most bank deposit products, and life insurance. Auto and property insurance policies were not included for non-military members due to eligibility restrictions.[12]
During this period, USAA changed it customer service approach and began posting customer satisfaction ratings on its website. This proved controversial as USAA did not allow members to post serious complaints or repeated low ratings, as evidenced in hundreds of complaints logged on external sites such as Consumer Affairs' "Top 1,146 Complaints and Reviews about USAA."
USAA is not Better Business Bureau accredited.[13]
Lines of business[edit]
Property, casualty, and life insurance[edit]
USAA offers a range of personal property and casualty (P&C) insurance, including automobile insurance, homeowner insurance, renters' insurance, as well as umbrella and personal property insurance. In addition to P&C insurance, USAA provides whole life insurance, term life insurance, and annuities. USAA's life insurance policies, while not completely unique in the industry, are different from most offerings since they do not include a war-exclusion clause[14]
Banking[edit]
Banking services are provided by USAA Federal Savings Bank. The bank was established on December 30, 1983. According to USAA's 2015 Annual Report to Members, USAA held over $62.549 billion in deposits with more than 6.3 million accounts, making the company the 28th largest bank in the world.
USAA Federal Savings Bank's bank lobby located in San Antonio is its only full-service banking location. Other cities, however, hold financial centers, often near military bases, which provide advice and assistance in obtaining services of any kind offered by USAA, in addition to opening those accounts online.
Banking services can be accessed in person, by mail, by phone, or through the internet. USAA Federal Savings Bank provides members with the ability to deposit checks to their accounts using mobile applications on the Apple iPhone and iPad,[15] mobile devices with Google's Android operating system,[16] and Microsoft's Windows Phone.[17] USAA was the first bank in the world to develop and deploy remote depositing by the Apple iPhone and holds a patent to this technology that has since been licensed widely by the banking industry across the world.
Major banking competitors include Bank of America-Military Bank, Pentagon Federal Credit Union,[18] and Navy Federal Credit Union.
Investing and financial planning[edit]
USAA provides brokerage services and no-load mutual funds. Mutual funds established by other companies and can be purchased as well as held by USAA investment accounts (or IMCO).
Target market[edit]
USAA's mission statement indicates its focus to serve its niche market, which consists of members of the U.S. military and their immediate families. To that end, the association has always marketed directly to members of the U.S. military. USAA membership is offered to officers and enlisted personnel, including those on active duty, those in the National Guard and Reserve, Officer candidates in commissioning programs (Academy, ROTC, OCS/OTS) and all those who have served in the aforementioned categories and who have retired or have been discharged honorably.[19][20] Children of USAA members are also eligible to purchase USAA's P&C insurance products, and former members of USAA are allowed to resume membership at any time (without an age limit).
Eligibility can be determined using its website;[21] however, the site does not contain a comprehensive statement of eligibility. USAA has, in the past, published a list[22] of other eligible persons including special agents of the FBI and Secret Service, agents of the various military investigative services (NCIS, OSI, CI and CID), U.S. Foreign Service Officers, and officers from a variety of other smaller agencies. Recently, USAA has been sharpening its focus on members of the military. So, people working for certain non-military agencies that were accommodated in the past may find that they are no longer eligible.[23]
Historically, only U.S. military officers (among certain other federally sworn officers) were eligible to join USAA, with descendants of USAA members able to purchase insurance from USAA-CIC. It did not matter if one was an active duty or retired officer; one could join at any time. In 1973, membership was opened to members of the National Guard and Reserves, and in 1996, eligibility was expanded to enlisted members of the armed services. As the number of persons who have served on active duty in an enlisted status in the U.S. Armed Forces is quite large, USAA chose to limit the establishment of eligibility to those who were currently on active duty or who had recently separated. The same time limit on establishment of eligibility was then applied to military officers. In 2008, USAA expanded membership eligibility to all military personnel and retirees, and all veterans who separated after 1996.[19] In November 2009, USAA expanded eligibility requirements to offer coverage to anyone who has ever served honorably in the US Military.[20]
Auto and property insurance and some banking services require that the customer meet membership eligibility criteria. USAA investment products[24] as well as deposit-only banking services[25] are available to non-members.[26]
Legal structure[edit]
One of the characteristics that allows USAA to operate differently than most other Fortune 500 companies is that it is not a corporation. The United Services Automobile Association is an inter-insurance exchange, the establishment of which is provided for under the Texas Insurance Code.[27] This insurance exchange is made up of current and former military officers and NCOs who have taken out P&C policies with USAA; thus they simultaneously are insured by each other and, as a group, own USAA's assets.
Normally, in the event of a catastrophe threatening the solvency of the exchange, each member could be held completely responsible for all the losses of all the other members. However, the Texas Insurance Code added a provision (Section 942.152) which stipulates that an inter-insurance exchange can, by agreement of the subscribers, limit member liability only to the premiums or premium deposits that the subscribers have paid to USAA.[28]
Other insurance services are provided by a variety of wholly owned subsidiaries. Adult children of USAA members and U.S. military junior enlisted personnel make up a group known at USAA as "associate members" insured through a subsidiary called USAA-Casualty Insurance Company (USAA-CIC). USAA-CIC is not an insurance exchange but rather a Delaware Insurance Corporation. This is a subtle nuance but is important concerning the return of profits – described below. Non-standard-risk drivers are insured by subsidiaries like USAA's County Mutual Insurance Company or USAA-General Indemnity Company. USAA also insures members in Europe through its subsidiary, USAA Limited.[29] It is uncommon for a U.S. based insurance company to provide international P&C coverage, but USAA does so because so many military families are stationed out-of-country.
Returning profits to the insured[edit]
Since there are no shareholders, profits are retained for financial strength or returned to the members. Returns are accomplished through a Subscriber's Account, commonly known as a distribution. Each year a portion of USAA's profit is retained as "unassigned," the rest is allocated to each member's Subscriber's Account using a formula based on the amount of premium the member paid that year as well as the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The allocation of capital to a member's Subscriber's Account occurs early in the calendar year. Late in the calendar year a portion of the member's Subscriber's Account is distributed to the member via checks or electronic funds transfer. Members with more than 40 years of membership also receive a special yearly "senior bonus" distribution which amounts to 10% of the member's Subscriber's Account balance. The entirety of the Subscriber's Account belongs to the member, but is not completely distributed until approximately 6 months after the member no longer has a USAA P&C policy.[30] In 2015, USAA returned $1.666 billion to its members.[31]
Those not eligible to join USAA but who are eligible to purchase insurance from USAA's subsidiaries, such as USAA-CIC, may receive dividends as declared by USAA.[32]
Miscellaneous information[edit]




USAA's Colorado Springs location


Besides its headquarters in San Antonio, USAA has a second major office in Phoenix, AZ, and other operations in Colorado Springs, CO; Norfolk, VA; Tampa, FL; Highland Falls, NY; London, England; Frankfurt, Germany;[33] and Plano, TX.[34]
As of 2016, USAA has expanded its Bitcoin integration to all members.[35]
Controversial leadership[edit]
Led by USAA Chairman of the Board Gen. Lester Lyles, USAF (Ret.), USAA’s Board of Directors named Stuart Parker CEO-elect in August 2015 to succeed former CEO Joe Robles after his retirement in February 2015. Parker became CEO in March 2015 and is a former USAF officer. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various leadership positions including Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. He has been with USAA since 1998, serving in various positions including chief operating officer (COO) and CFO. Carl Liebert succeeded Parker as COO after serving as USAA Capital Corporation President. Carl Liebert is a former U.S. Navy officer, and joined the USAA management team in 2013.[36]
USAA experienced much growth under its former CEO, retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert F. McDermott. The USAA building was constructed under his tenure and McDermott was behind USAA's shift from service-by-mail to service-by-phone.[37] He was succeeded as CEO by retired Air Force General Robert Herres.[38] It was under Herres that USAA expanded its services to enlisted members of the military and developed Internet based financial services.[39] Following General Herres as CEO was Robert G. Davis, a former Army officer[40] who came to USAA with experience in a variety of financial services companies. Davis is said to have changed the culture at USAA; during his time at USAA, membership, assets and net worth grew significantly, and customer satisfaction declined precipitously.
His tenure, however, was not without controversy. Davis oversaw USAA's first layoffs and by some reports had a confrontational style of leadership. Davis had indicated to USAA employees that he intended to continue to lead USAA until 2010, however, he retired in December 2007.[41] The nature of his retirement seems to have been precipitous, as USAA CEO Josue Robles has stated that upon assuming the role of CEO, "I thought I was just going to be a temporary CEO and (the board) said, 'Guess what? The permanent CEO is you'."[42]
On Glassdoor.com, claims adjusters reported satisfaction at 3.5 on a scale of 1-5[43].
Oversight[edit]
USAA is subject to insurance regulation and examination by state regulators as well as federal entities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,[clarification needed] Federal Trade Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Its records are audited by Ernst & Young.[citation needed]
Falling service ratings[edit]
USAA, which is not BBB accredited[44], has not consistently received the highest customer service ratings available to financial services companies. In 2002, JD Power awarded USAA its Chairman's Award.[45] This turn of the century evaluation was the last time that USAA was ever noted for customer service by JD Power.
Its discount brokerage service has fared better in more recent evaluations. In its May 2009 issue, Consumer Reports named USAA's brokerage division as the top rated discount brokerage service in the United States.[46] Yelp scored it at 2 out of 5.[47]
Employment[edit]
As of the end of 2015, USAA employed more than 28,200 people at its offices throughout the world.[48]

The Life, Death and Rebirth of USAA Ventures | Fortune.comFinanceSearchSearchTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDGovernmentHours After North Korea Missile Launch, Trump Reassigns Homeland Security ChiefCourtesy of USAAVenture CapitalThe Life, Death and Rebirth of USAA VenturesDan PrimackJan 28, 2016In 2010, private insurance and financial services giant USAA dipped its toe into the waters of startup investing, backing an auto-buying and pricing information platform called TrueCar. By the time TrueCar (true) went public in May 2014, USAA would have a full-fledged venture capital program with dedicated staffers and $330 million of committed capital.Today, however, USAA's venture capital business is in restart mode, after losing its top executives.The program originally began with the TrueCar (true) investment, which was led by a USAA attorney named Ron DiGiacomo and his colleague Tom Ferries. The pair, which had some experience with corporate strategic investing from their prior jobs at Ford Motor Co. (f), were seeking ways to boost USAA's auto loan volume and, in particular, aid a small business unit that helped members get good deals on new cars.DiGiacomo and Ferries came to know TrueCar's CEO Scott Painter, who jumped at the chance to get his company's product in front of USAA members. Soon USAA was participating in its first venture capital round, and would follow a similar strategic model with deals for loyalty rewards startup Mall Networks (later renamed Cartera Commerce) and a company that facilitated the auto titling process.DiGiacomo and Ferries would both move on by early 2012, with the nascent investment program handed over to another USAA attorney named Vic Pascucci (who became the company's head of corporate development). Pascucci picked up the pace, backing startups like babysitting marketplace Care.com (care) and SnapSheet, a self-service photo app that helps users settle auto insurance claims.By 2014, Pascucci had a growing portfolio but not nearly enough help. So he began to hire from the corporate venture world. His first senior recruit was Alex Marquez, a 12-year Intel Capital veteran who had invested in such companies as Ancestry.com, Kabam, and GameStop (gme). Next came Gopi Rangan, who had been leading venture capital and M&A for Silicon Valley chip-maker Altera.Together, the trio pumped around $180 million in more than a dozen companies. But almost as quickly as it had come together, the program began to unravel due to a series of small cuts and tumults.First came the retirement of CEO Joe Robles, who had originally championed the investment initiative. Second, a USAA member suffered a family tragedy related to his use of Care.com, which cast a pall over the program. Third, USAA began facing broader market challenges, including lower gas prices that increased the risk profile of auto insurance. In short, USAA seemed to have bigger fish to fry ― which didn't sit well with the senior ventures pros.Marquez resigned last July, later joining NantMobile as an executive vice president. Pascucci left in September. Two months later, Rangan was gone. Plenty of portfolio companies stayed behind ― and several corporate development staffers kept their unit's lights on ― but more than $100 million of dedicated capital remained untapped."USAA's top priority now is defending itself from the types of startups that the venture program was working with, and investing in," says a source. "Regular venture capital firms fade away very slowly, but this is how it goes with corporate groups."Get Term Sheet, our daily newsletter on deals & deal-makersFollowing Pascucci's departure, USAA installed a longtime product manager named Nathan McKinley as head of corporate development (so far he has taken one of Pascucci's five portfolio company board seats, per his LinkedIn profile). USAA also staffed up his department in December, with a company spokesman saying that it now has 14 full-time employees ―nearly double the number it had last year ― although venture investing is only one of their responsibilities. There also are plans to hire at least one more senior executive, alongside McKinley and another longtime USAA corporate development pro named Michael Smith (whose prior job was as a consultant on corporate strategy and valuations).So far the McKinley-led team has made one investment, a follow-in deal for Snapsheet. It also is expected to announce its first new portfolio company sometime next month. A source says that the strategy is to significantly slow the investment pace from where it was during Pascucci's tenure, although it remains too early to know for sure how things will shake out. For the record, USAA says it has no prescribed deal pace.The group still is allowed to have up to $330 million invested at any one time."If deals make strategic sense, they'll make them," says a source. "But I think the new team has fewer interest in really blowing the thing out and marching to their own drummer. They know what happened last time."Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
