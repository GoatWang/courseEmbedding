Ventas to Acquire Ardent Health Services for $1.75 Billion




Creates Growth Platform in Attractive U.S. Hospital Real Estate Market


Ventas to Retain Owned Real Estate and Separate Operations into 
      Company Led by Ardent Management Team








April 06, 2015 06:33 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) announced today 
      that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately-owned 
      Ardent Medical Services, Inc. (with its affiliates “Ardent Health 
      Services”), a premier provider of health care services and one of the 
      ten largest for-profit hospital companies in the U.S., for $1.75 billion 
      in cash. Ardent Health Services will be entitled to distribute up to $75 
      million in excess cash to its existing shareholders. The transaction is 
      expected to be immediately accretive to Ventas’s normalized funds from 
      operations (“FFO”) per share by $0.08 to $0.10 in the first full year 
      after close.
    


      Ardent Health Services is owned by private equity funds managed by Welsh, 
      Carson, Anderson & Stowe. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Ardent Health 
      Services and its subsidiaries own and operate leading health systems in 
      major markets in the U.S. Ardent Health Services currently generates 
      approximately $2 billion in annual revenues with over 50 percent of its 
      revenue derived from commercial (private) payors.
    

      Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, Ventas intends to 
      separate Ardent Health Services’ hospital operations from its owned real 
      estate and sell the hospital operations to one or more newly formed 
      entities (collectively, “Ardent”) owned by current management of Ardent 
      Health Services, other equity sources, and up to 9.9 percent owned by 
      Ventas. Ventas and Ardent will enter into pre-agreed long-term 
      triple-net leases with an expected going in cash yield exceeding 7 
      percent and annual escalators estimated at 2.5 percent. The EBITDARM to 
      rent coverage ratio for the purchased facilities is expected to be 
      approximately 2.9x in year one.
    

      Ventas will own ten high-quality hospitals (and related real estate) 
      operated by Ardent under the names BSA Health System in Amarillo, Texas, 
      Hillcrest HealthCare System in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Lovelace Health 
      System in Albuquerque, New Mexico. These assets include acute care, 
      heart, rehab and women’s health hospitals, comprising approximately 3.2 
      million square feet and 2,045 beds.
    

      “This transaction builds upon our excellent track record of executing 
      innovative and value-creating opportunities, and solidifies our 
      leadership position in healthcare real estate,” said Ventas Chairman and 
      Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro. “The addition of Ardent’s 
      platform, which includes high-quality assets with significant market 
      share in three key markets, and a highly-regarded hospital management 
      team, creates a strong avenue for growth in the attractive hospital real 
      estate market. The transaction also increases our diversification by 
      property type and operator. We look forward to partnering with Ardent’s 
      seasoned management team as a best-in-class operator to grow its 
      business.”
    

      David T. Vandewater, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ardent, 
      said, “We have built a leading U.S. hospital franchise, currently 
      focused on three key markets with incredible growth potential. The 
      current management team and Ardent employees are excited about this 
      agreement with Ventas and we look forward to expanding Ardent and 
      capitalizing on the significant growth opportunities we see in the 
      immense, highly fragmented U.S. hospital market. With this strong 
      capital and operating partnership, we can expand while continuing to 
      serve patients and our communities.”
    

Transaction Benefits



Accretive Transaction/Leverage Neutral. This transaction is 
        expected to be immediately accretive to Ventas’s normalized FFO per 
        share by $0.08 to $0.10 (cash) in the first full year after close on a 
        leverage neutral basis. Ventas’s going in cash unlevered yield on the 
        Company’s aggregate net investment is expected to exceed 7 percent. 
        Ventas will maintain its strong credit profile and balance sheet, and 
        there is no expected change to the Company’s credit rating or outlook.
      

Increases Ventas’s Presence in Attractive Industry. The $1 
        trillion U.S. hospital market (by revenues) is benefiting from 
        attractive dynamics, including an increase in U.S. hospital 
        expenditures, increasing emergency room visits and admissions, a 
        growing 65 and over population, and more than 10 million newly insured 
        individuals. With Ventas’s support, Ardent will be well positioned to 
        drive future consolidation opportunities in a highly fragmented 
        market. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has 
        recommended a 3.25 percent increase in Medicare rates for acute-care 
        services for fiscal year 2016.
      

Provides Follow On Investment Opportunities. Ventas expects to 
        participate in Ardent’s future hospital acquisitions. Ardent has a 
        robust pipeline of attractive revenue-enhancing investment 
        opportunities in its portfolio, in addition to a visible external 
        growth pipeline.
      

Adds High-Quality Hospital Portfolio with >50 Percent Commercial 
        (Private) Payor Mix and Substantial Market Share. Ardent is a top 
        ten for-profit hospital operator in the U.S. with high-quality 
        hospital systems with strong payor and provider relationships and 
        substantial market share in three key markets. Over 50 percent of 
        Ardent’s revenue base is derived from private pay commercial payors.
      

Ardent Will Continue to be Run by an Exceptional, Tenured 
        Management Team. Ardent’s best-in-class management team will 
        continue to lead the company, and its strong employee base will remain 
        in place. Ardent will remain headquartered in Nashville with no 
        expected changes to its current operations.
      

Enhances Diversification. The transaction enhances Ventas’s 
        rental revenue diversification by property type and operator. U.S. 
        acute care hospitals will represent approximately 6 percent of 
        Ventas’s pro forma net operating income (“NOI”).
      

Extends Proven Track Record of Fueling Operator Growth. Ventas 
        has a successful track record of identifying and growing scalable 
        operating platforms as evidenced by the dramatic growth of Lillibridge 
        Healthcare Services and Atria Senior Living since investment by 
        Ventas. The Ardent acquisition adds a best-in-class operator and will 
        expand Ventas’s industry leadership across healthcare segments.
      


Approvals, Timing and Funding


      The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain specified 
      closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, and is 
      expected to close mid-year 2015.
    

      Ventas expects to fund the transaction on a leverage neutral basis with 
      proceeds from previously announced dispositions and loan repayments, 
      bank debt and long-term debt and equity capital sources.

Delivering on Our Promise – Excellence. Sustained.®
Excellence is Ventas’s hallmark. It comes from the Ventas Advantage of superior properties, platforms and people.
As a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) with a highly diversified portfolio of nearly 1,300 seniors housing and healthcare properties in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, Ventas is excited to operate at the intersection of two powerful and dynamic industries – healthcare and real estate.

Ventas (VTR) Closes Spin-Off of Care Capital Properties


August 19, 2015, 03:30:00 PM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

As expected, Ventas, Inc.
VTR

, the Chicago, IL-based healthcare real estate investment trust
("REIT"), completed the spin-off of majority of its
post-acute/skilled nursing facility ("SNF") portfolio into Care
Capital Properties, Inc. ("CCP"). This spin-off underscores Ventas'
consistent efforts to enhance its shareholders' value by setting up
two separate REITs with distinct strategies.



Care Capital will operate as an independent, pure-play, skilled
nursing REIT, backed by Ventas' legacy and opportunities to
leverage an experienced management team, a solid balance sheet and
a diversified portfolio. The spun-off entity will also be capable
of capitalizing on contractual escalations and redevelopment
opportunities (read more:
Ventas Set to Close Care Capital Properties
Spin-Off Deal

).



Following the spin-off, Ventas is expected to pay a dividend of at
least 73 cents per share; while Care Capital will likely pay a
dividend of at least 57 cents per share. This comes in line with
the earlier expectation that post spin-off, the combined
disbursement would be up at least 10% from the current combined
dividend payment of 79 cents per share. Subject to approval of the
company's board of directors, the dividend hike is expected to be
effective from third-quarter 2015.



Further, it is anticipated that Ventas will provide updated
guidance for 2015 normalized funds from operation ("FFO") during
the third quarter. On a full-quarter basis, the company expects the
spin-off to impact its normalized FFO in a range of 20-22cents.



Ventas currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).



Investors interested in the REIT industry may consider stocks like
CoreSite Realty Corporation
COR

, Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc.
AHT

and Summit Hotel Properties, Inc.
INN

. All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).



Note:
FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is
obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other
non-cash expenses to net income.

Kindred Sells Skilled Nursing Facility Business for $700M









Armie Margaret Lee




Jul 3, 2017 8:14 PM EDT













 














































































 Kindred Healthcare Inc. (KND) said Friday, June 30, it has inked a deal to sell its skilled nursing facility business for $700 million in cash to a joint venture led by alternative asset manager  BlueMountain Capital Management LLC. The divestiture comes after Kindred in November of last year announced its decision to exit its skilled nursing facility business as both an owner and an operator. Louisville, Ky.-based Kindred is selling 89 nursing centers with 11,308 licensed beds and seven assisted living facilities with 380 licensed beds across 18 states to the JV called BM Eagle Holdings LLC. Thirty-six of the nursing facilities are leased from real estate investment trust Ventas Inc. (VTR) . Kindred on November 14, 2016 announced an agreement with Ventas that gives Kindred the option to buy the real estate for the 36 facilities leased from Ventas for $700 million, a deal that facilitates Kindred's exit from the skilled nursing facility business. Kindred said on June 30 that as it closes on the sale of the Ventas properties to BlueMountain, Kindred will pay Ventas the allocable portion of the $700 million purchase price for the Ventas properties and Ventas will convey the real estate for the applicable Ventas property to BlueMountain or its designee. Shares of Kindred closed Monday at $11.70, up 5 cents. The company has a market capitalization of $1.01 billion. Kindred said it expects that the cash proceeds, anticipated working capital liquidation, tax benefits, retained assets and other items will result in approximate total value to Kindred of $910 million after subtracting estimated transaction and severance costs.

The premise is simple, however. When RSI moves above 70, it is overbought and could lead to a downward move. When RSI moves below 30, it is oversold and could lead to an upward move. But, we must be patient before we enter our trades, because sometimes the RSI can stay overbought or oversold for quite awhile. The worst thing we can do is try to pick a top or a bottom of a strong move that continues to move into further overbought or oversold territory. So we must wait until the RSI crosses back under 70 or crosses back above 30.

As traders, we are more interested to take part in strong moves and don’t join moves that show weakness – or we may even watch for an entry in the opposite direction of a weak move. These guidelines do not hold true in all situations, but they are a good general aid in trading decisions. When a stock traded on high volume then is it is good time for active Investors to attain the opportunity of this situation. For every buyer, there needs to be someone who sold them the shares they bought, just as there must be a buyer in order for a seller to get rid of his or her shares. This battle between buyers and sellers for the best price in all different time frames creates movement while longer-term technical and fundamental factors play out. Using volume to analyze stocks can bolster profits and also reduce risk.
