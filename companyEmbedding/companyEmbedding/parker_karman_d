Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Standard Wheelchairs: When you need to get around town, using a standard wheelchair might be your best option. Standard wheelchairs are designed for everyday use and let most people get around their house or travel locally. The person sitting in the wheelchair will push the wheelchair on their own. These are typically some of the most affordable wheelchairs available, even though they can be improved with a variety of add-ons for comfort and safety.
Transport Wheelchairs:Transport wheelchairs are often the best way for caregivers to get patients to doctor’s visits, physical therapy sessions and other necessary appointments. Unlike standard wheelchairs, transport wheelchairs are designed to be pushed by another person rather than propelled by the patient. These wheelchairs are lightweight and easy to push. They also are designed to be easy to break down for storage, as well as having many features that help increase the comfort of the person being transported.
Lightweight Wheelchairs: Lightweight wheelchairs are often the solution for people who want more freedom when using their manual wheelchairs. These chairs are convenient solutions for individuals who travel frequently and want a wheelchair that will easily break down for storage. They’re perfect for putting in the trunk of a car or storing when taking a flight. Weighing up to 35 pounds, the light nature of these wheelchairs mean that they are easy for anyone to maneuver.
Ultra Light Wheelchairs: When having the lightest wheelchairs possible is the most important factor in your life, consider ultra light wheelchairs. At 12 to 27 pounds, they are the lightest wheelchairs available for general use today. You can choose between foldable or rigid ultra light wheelchairs. Foldable wheelchairs will have more moving parts than rigid wheelchairs, which makes them better for use on rough or uneven terrain. Rigid wheelchairs can be as light as possible.
Heavy Duty Wheelchairs: When patients weight more than 350 pounds, they need special bariatric wheelchairs to help support their weight. Heavy duty wheelchairs are designed to let people who weigh up to 700 pounds feel comfortable when using their chairs. Along with being wider and having more support, bariatric wheelchairs have many of the same features of standard wheelchairs and are designed to enhance comfort for users.
Sport Wheelchairs: Being in a wheelchair doesn’t mean that you can’t be active and participate in sports. Whether it means hitting the court for some basketball or tennis, or getting on the road to train for a marathon or triathlon, athletic people need sport wheelchairs to perform their best. Daily Care Inc. has sport wheelchairs for all types of athletes. These chairs are lightweight but durable and are designed for maximum speed and performance.
Tilt Wheelchairs: It’s easy for people to experience pain and discomfort when sitting in a wheelchair for long periods of time. Having all of their weight shifted onto a few pressure points can lead to aches and pains, along with the potential for bedsores. Comfort is important for people confined to wheelchairs, which is where tilt wheelchairs come in handy. These wheelchairs can be adjusted to find a comfortable position for a wheelchair user that shifts weight while they are sitting.
Pediatric Wheelchairs: Children who are in wheelchairs have special needs. Purchasing a standard, adult-sized manual wheelchair for them often won’t be comfortable or allow them to move with freedom. Special pediatric wheelchairs have the features kids need, including a smaller and lighter frame. Many of these models are have adjustable seats to grow as a child gets older so that a parent doesn’t need to replace the chair.
Reclining Wheelchairs: A manual reclining wheelchair is any chair that has a footrest or a backrest that can be placed into a reclining position. Reclining wheelchairs are an option for people who will be using their wheelchairs at night during activities such as watching TV or reading and who might fall asleep while still in their chair. They are also good choices for people whose physical limitations make it tough for them to sit upright for extended periods of time.
