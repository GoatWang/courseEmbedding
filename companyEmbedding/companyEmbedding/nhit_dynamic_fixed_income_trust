Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.




         Outside normal market hours our complete inventory is not reflected and trade requests may not be fulfilled.
	
      



         Ratings are opinions and not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes. Ratings should not be relied on as investment advice. Please read important disclaimer information.
	
      



         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
      



Before investing, consider the funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

         A CD ladder, depending on the types and amount of securities within it, may not ensure adequate diversification of your investment portfolio. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, a lack of diversification may result in heightened volatility of your portfolio value. You must perform your own evaluation as to whether a CD ladder and the securities held within it are consistent with your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. To learn more about diversification and its effects on your portfolio, contact a representative.
	
      



         The CD ladder strategies displayed are provided for educational purposes and are not intended to serve as the primary basis for your investment, financial or tax planning decisions.
	
      



         Displayed rates of return, including Annual Percentage Yield (APY), represent stated APY for either individual Certificates of Deposit (CDs), or multiple CDs within model CD ladders, were identified from Fidelity inventory as of the time stated. For current inventory, including available CDs, please view the CDs & Ladders tab.
	
      



         The CDs in the CD Search Results screen are displayed on the basis of them offering the highest yields available given certain selected criteria. The criteria entered are at the sole discretion of the user, including the maturities of the strategy selected and yield-based inventory filtering, and any information obtained should not be considered an offer to buy or sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any securities.
	
      



         You acknowledge that your requests for information are unsolicited and shall neither constitute, nor be considered as investment advice by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, Fidelity Distributors Corporation, or their affiliates (collectively, "Fidelity").
	
      



         Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are debt instruments offered by commercial banks, thrifts and brokerages to raise funds for their business activities. Minimum investment amount is typically one CD or multiple CDs for a ladder strategy. All brokered CDs displayed are FDIC-insured as indicated by the Attribute: FDIC. The FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per institution per category of account, or up to $250,000 in qualifying retirement accounts. Note that FDIC insurance only covers the principal amount of the CD and any accrued interest. In some instances, CD's may be purchased on the secondary market at a price which reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance.

         1. The secondary market may be limited. The pre-maturity sale price of CDs may be less than its original purchase price, particularly if interest rates are higher at the time of sale. There may be certain features or provisions of the CD that may also influence its market price. If you want to buy or sell a CD, Fidelity Brokered Services LLC ("FBS") may charge you a fee. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the BondDesk platform, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         2. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Your ability to sell a CD on the secondary market is subject to market conditions. If your CD has a step rate, the interest rate of your CD may be higher or lower than prevailing market rates. The initial rate on a step rate CD is not the yield to maturity. If your CD has a call provision, which many step rate CDs do, please be aware the decision to call the CD is at the issuer’s sole discretion. Also, if the issuer calls the CD, you may be confronted with a less favorable interest rate at which to reinvest your funds. Fidelity makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution.
	
      



         3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the account holder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
      



         4. Fidelity makes new issue CDs available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC and National Financial Services LLC receive compensation for participating in the offering as a selling group member or underwriter.
	
      



         5. Other concessions apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.

         The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Please see the ratings tab for more information about methodology. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

Featured Reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of use and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the website (after a delay for screening against guidelines) and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


The ratings and experience of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and is not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating and review.


Please contact a Fidelity representative if you have additional questions or concerns about the ratings and reviews posted here.
	
    

System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.



Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.



Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Offer Rules:


         
	
	
	       This offer is valid for new or existing Fidelity customers. In order to receive the commission-free trades, you must designate an existing eligible Fidelity IRA or brokerage account or open and fund a new eligible Fidelity IRA or brokerage account with net new assets. Deposits of $50,000-$99,999 will receive 300 free trades, and deposits of $100,000 or more will receive 500 free trades. Trades must be used within 2 years of being credited to the customer’s account. Commission-free trades must be designated to the one account receiving the qualifying assets or amount and are limited to online domestic equities and options trades. Options trades are limited to 20 contracts or less per trade; for orders beyond these limitations, standard commission rates apply. No cash compensation will be given for any unused commission-free trades. Offer is nontransferable, limited to one per individual per rolling 12 months and may not be combined with other offers. Fidelity reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions or terminate this offer at any time. Other terms and conditions, or eligibility criteria may apply.


To be eligible, customers must register online at www.fidelity.com/ATP500free or through a representative. New accounts or designated eligible accounts must be funded within 60 days ("qualification period"). Cash, eligible securities, and/or margin debit balance transfers from multiple sources will be aggregated to determine total account funding; assets will be valued at the time Fidelity receives them. Allow up to seven business days for assets to be registered in the system. Funding must come from an external, non-Fidelity source via any standard monetary transfer method (a standard Transfer of Assets form, check, Electronic Funds Transfer, ADM deposit, etc.); rollovers from a former employer’s Fidelity record kept workplace savings plan are treated as coming from an external source for purposes of this offer. Net new assets mean external new money in minus money out, including distributions and transfers, during the qualification period.


Account holders must maintain a minimum account balance of $50,000 of net new assets for this free trade offer (minus any losses related to trading or market volatility) for at least nine months from the date on which the trades are credited to the account, otherwise commission charges may be incurred retroactively on free trade executions based on the applicable commission rate under Fidelity's Commission & Fee Schedule.


Eligible accounts include non-retirement (Individual or Joint) or Fidelity IRA (Rollover IRA, Traditional IRA, Inherited IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA) accounts in which individual security trading is not prohibited and which meet the minimum account opening or funding requirements.


The promotion is not available for the following account types/products: business accounts (including those opened by union officials); trust accounts; fiduciary accounts (including custodial accounts, estate accounts); non-prototype accounts; college investment trust accounts; 529 college savings plan accounts; Fidelity accounts managed by Strategic Advisers, Inc. (i.e., Portfolio Advisory Services); Institutional Wealth Services (IWS) clients; clients of registered investment advisors working with Fidelity Investments; annuities; and Stock Plan Services accounts. Offer is not valid for non-U.S. residents; persons employed by FINRA or a securities organization in a regulatory capacity; employees of Fidelity, its affiliates, and members of their immediate families and households, or the media who cover financial services. Certain states and local jurisdictions have laws that limit or restrict public employees from accepting items of value from vendors such as Fidelity that provide services to public institutions. Some public entities such as governments, state universities, health care organizations, etc., also have internal policies that may contain similar restrictions. If you are a public official or employee, you should determine if one of these laws or internal policies applies to you. By accepting this incentive, we assume that you are in compliance with your jurisdiction’s laws and institution’s internal policies.
