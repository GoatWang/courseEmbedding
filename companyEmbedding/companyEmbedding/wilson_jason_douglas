Q: How do I bail or bond someone out of jail?
There are 2 ways to post a bond:
Cash bond: The total amount of the bond, in cash, is placed with St. Johns County to guarantee the
arrestee will appear in court for their hearing. Should the arrestee fail to appear, the money will be
forfeited. Should a not guilty verdict be rendered or the case be dismissed, or at the conclusion of trial
proceedings, bond money will be refunded. If a judge so orders, any court costs or court fines will be
taken out of the posted bond. Once the case is disposed of, the remaining funds will be refunded.
Refunds for cash bonds will be done at the Clerk of Courts Office in the Court House.
Cash, cashiers checks or money orders are the only accepted methods of payment for
bond. Cashiers checks and money orders MUST be made out to: Clerk of the Court, St. Johns
County, FOR LOCAL CHARGES. Should the bond be for another agency, IE, Putnam County, the
cashiers check or money order should be made out to the court of that agency.
Surety bond: A bonding company posts a bond that guarantees an arrestee will appear at the next court
date. Neither St. Johns County nor the Sheriffs Office participates in the contract between an arrestee
and the bonding company. The bonding company charges a fee for each bond posted. Consult the
Yellow Pages for listings of bonding companies.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Wilson Jason Douglas carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Wilson Jason Douglas



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Wilson Jason Douglas



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Wilson Jason Douglas



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
