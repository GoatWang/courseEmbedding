AccuBlend CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) A Jacoby-Tarbox® Program™






Jacoby-Tarbox® Eductors™ for Non-Powered Mixing Applications











 

Eductors require no power, which means no moving parts.  The design of the educator creates pressure differential allowing fluid to flow naturally within the device – creating suction, mixing, and pushing the liquid throughout the tank.
Jacoby-Tarbox® TLAs™ & Jacoby-Tarbox® In-line Eductors™ are designed and built to provide optimum performance.
And we can prove it !

Jacoby-Tarbox® is the only Eductor manufacturer that can design your mixing solutions based on actual computational data.
Send us your specifications:
1. Goal of Mixing: blend, suspended solids, stratified layers, heating
2. Tank (“reservoir”) dimensions
3. Fluid properties
4. Turnover time
We will send you the proof !
Our Engineers will simulate your mixing application in our Accublend CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) program and show you the stages of mixing, including flow and directional velocities, until fully blended.  We can provide the number of TLA’s required for your mixing needs and visually show; velocity profiles, velocity of the fluid in the tank, and a digital video snapshot of your tank being mixed over time.

The different colors represent velocity magnitude in the tank, dark blue having no movement and red having the highest movement.  In the fully blended tank, there may be two different velocities but there is overall movement in the tank.  In this example, the tank is 45 feet tall and 32 feet in diameter.  Tank volume is 250,000 gallons, the fluid property is water and turnover time is 1 hour.

 
 
 


Jacoby-Tarbox In-Line Eductors™
 
 
In-Line Eductors are the Next Generation of jet pumps, ejectors, and venture pumps, providing in-line mixing, pumping, or heating in various process lines.  Eductors decrease costs as there are no moving parts and require no direct power.
 
 
…a greener, safer solution

Dairy Products Marketing
Experience is the best teacher, and that’s why T.C. Jacoby & Co. is the leader in dairy product marketing. From understanding market trends and supply and demand, to navigating the regulatory environment in the U.S., North America and globally, T.C. Jacoby & Co. has the expertise and depth of knowledge to help position your dairy operation for success in any market.
We craft better dairy market solutions because our dairy professionals have worked in every aspect of the industry:

On the farm – Our team members with dairy farm backgrounds understand the challenges that producers face daily because they’ve faced them too. They care about your business and offer the sound, sensible advice you need to keep it running profitably.
In the plant – Team members with plant and processing experience are experts when it comes to finding the production solutions that make the best use of your capacity. They also help you respond to—and plan for—swings in the market and inventory challenges.
On the road – Moving dairy products is just as important as making them, and our team includes logistics experts who understand dairy product transport regulations and ensure carriers move your products safely. They also know dairy products have a shelf life, and that being on time with deliveries isn’t just good business—it means the difference between quality products and useless spoilage.
On the trading floor – The commodity markets are complicated places. That’s why T.C. Jacoby & Co. team members understand both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Federal Milk Marketing Orders. We share our expertise in these areas with our customers to ensure they have the best picture of the market they can get, and can plan accordingly.
On the front lines – Over the years, T.C. Jacoby & Co. team members have played leading roles within dairy industry organizations that work for the good of the industry. We helped form the U.S. Dairy Export Council and are heavily active in both the American Dairy Products Institute and the International Dairy Foods Association. By being on the front lines of the industry, we explore new opportunities for our customers while also helping foster market and regulatory conditions that ensure their success.

When it comes to marketing dairy products, we have the advantage of devoting almost 70 years to developing the best team, the best experience, the best connections and an attitude of service and integrity. Let us show you what a difference that experience will make for your business.

Ex-Volvo boss Stefan Jacoby to head GM's international operations



Chris Paukert
Aug 2, 2013 











He was too talented not to surface somewhere, we just didn't know where and when. Nine months ago, Stefan Jacoby stepped down from his post as Volvo CEO, a move that caught many off guard. At the time, the separation was called "amicable," but word is that the strong-willed executive clashed with owners Geely and the automaker's board.

Stefan Jacoby says Volvo contemplating Mini rival



Jonathon Ramsey
Aug 21, 2012 























Up or down? That's the question about which way Volvo is going to take its brand: solidly into premium, full-size sedan luxury or into a smaller near-premium offering to challenge what is, right now, a very hot segment. Most of the chatter has centered around the former option, with Volvo declaring it would go for the top luxury guns, a patent filing suggesting an S100 flagship, and talk of a C90 luxury coupe to fight models like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe.

Volvo denies boss Jacoby is taking a run at Opel CEO post



Jonathon Ramsey
Aug 7, 2012 











It seems that every news report that involves the name "Opel" is eventually followed by a report that says, "Uh, never mind." Executives fill positions, then they're gone, or they're supposed to fill positions but duck out before doing so, five-year product offensives turn into grabbing for life preservers, and turnaround plans are followed by... new turnaround plans. With the recent departure of Opel CEO Karl-Friedrich Stracke, Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri reported that Volvo CEO Stefan Ja

Volvo CEO admits automaker's cars are too complicated



Zach Bowman
Jun 25, 2012 











Volvo CEO Stefan Jacoby has said his company's products are "too complicated for the consumer," according to Automotive News. Jacoby said 75 percent of Volvo customers don't know "all the possibilities they have with their car." He contrasted the automaker with Apple's intuitive products, which make consumers feel in control of a device instead of overwhelmed by its capabilities. The executive also made it clear that in order for the company to thrive, it needs to better cater to the next genera

Volvo is poised to rapidly inflate its presence in China, and it believes the way forward is through an $11 billion spending plan. "We want to revive Volvo and give the brand its strength back," says Li Shufu, Chairman of Geely Automobile Holdings. Speaking with German magazine Wirtschafts Woche, Shufu disclosed that Geely will put up $11 billion for a new engine factory, increased research and development and technology upgrades.

Volvo CEO challenges EU, says it's "far too early" to dismiss fossil fuels



Sebastian Blanco
Apr 3, 2012 











Volvo CEO Stefan Jacoby may be steering a company that is working on plug-in vehicles like the XDC60 plug-in hybrid and the C30 Electric, but he recently told an industry seminar in Brussels that an all-of-the-above approach is the right one. To wit, "It is far too early to dismiss the conventional diesel and petrol power trains," he said.

Jacoby reiterates Volvo considering NA plant



Jonathon Ramsey
Mar 13, 2012 











Volvo sold 449,255 cars globally in 2011, with 67,240 of those sales coming from right here in the States. By 2020, CEO Stefan Jacoby aims to boost those numbers to 800,000 sales globally and 120,000 here, and to do so, he can't let the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro stand in the way. That's why, according to a report in Automotive News, Jacoby says the company will spend "the next two or three years" considering building a plant in the U.S. or Mexico.

XC60 Plug-In Hybrid shows where Volvo is headed



Sebastian Blanco
Jan 10, 2012 























Volvo has made it a point to emphasize – surprise – the safety of its plug-in vehicles at recent auto shows. Now, at the Detroit Auto Show, the Swedish automaker has showed off the XC60 Plug-In Gasoline Hybrid Concept, a way to gauge American reaction to the idea of a plug-in CUV from Volvo. Why? Because this concept is headed to the U.S. and Chinese markets – in a different guise and with a lot of changes – within "a couple of years." That means something like 2014-2015.

Because this concept is headed to the U.S. and Chinese markets – in a different guise and with a lot of changes – "a couple of years." That means something like 2014-2015. Volvo's f

Dec 19, 2011 























Our spy photographers have manged to lay lenses on the new Volvo V40 as engineers put the vehicle through a little cold-weather testing. Until just recently, we'd heard that the five-door version of the C30 would be called the V30, but Volvo CEO Stefan Jacoby has confirmed that the model will actually come wearing V40 badges.

Report: Volvo to downsize engines in 2013; ponders diesel for U.S.



Autoblog Staff
Dec 5, 2010 











Engine downsizing is considered an effective method for reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency and that's precisely why many automakers have developed smaller mills to replace older, larger motors. Kia, Volkswagen, Fiat, Audi and many others already announced their intentions to introduce downsized engines in upcoming models. We can now add Volvo to the ranks of automakers developing new low-displacement powerplants.

Report: Volvo moves away from 'premium' image



Dan Roth
Nov 29, 2010 











Volvo should no longer be lumped into the premium category, according to the wishes of CEO Stefan Jacoby. It's not that the cars aren't good, but according to Autocar, Jacoby thinks it sends the wrong message. "It sounds like a pricing strategy, and it's got an expensive ring to it," he tells the UK pub. Having recently come to Volvo from a tenure as CEO of Volkswagen's American operation, Jacoby has no illusions about where his new brand sits. This latest statement dovetails with an earlier ass

Nov 17, 2010 











Volvo CEO Stefan Jacoby has never been the biggest fan of electric vehicles (EVs), having said in the past that mainstream affordability and widespread readiness are many years away. Speaking at the Los Angeles Auto Show today, Jacoby sounded a slightly different tune – for a while.

Yes or No? Jacoby reportedly says Volvo isn't ready for a 7 Series rival



Chris Shunk
Nov 1, 2010 











Just days after Geely purchased Volvo from Ford, the Chinese automaker's chairman, Li Shufu, proclaimed that the Swedish automaker needed a 7 Series fighter. Shufu's idea makes a lot of sense, at least in the large car-loving China market, where Volvo leadership wants to push a lot more metal. But when Shufu stated that Volvo needed to go big, he admitted that he needed to sell the idea to the company's new board. According to Autocar there is at least one very important vote that doesn't like t

He is the president and CEO of Volkswagen of America. Doron?DORON LEVIN, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Hi, Betty. We are here with Stefan Jacoby, the president and CEO of Volkswagen of America, a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, the German automaker. Welcome and thank you for being here.STEFAN JACOBY, PRESIDENT AND CEO, VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA: Thank you very much, a pleasure to be here.LEVIN: That's great. Tell us a little bit the Chattanooga plant which is on track now to be open I guess early next year in the United States.JACOBY: Right, I just came from Chattanooga actually yesterday.LEVIN: Tell us a little bit about -JACOBY: We had a bond (ph) visit and we had a business review there and I can tell you we are on time. The buildings are - well, they're made now and we are installing now all the equipment and we are on time.We are recruiting people. We have hired already 600 out of the 2,000 employees which we will hire until the end of this year. And we are ready to start producing our new mid-size sedan at the beginning of next year.LEVIN: Well, you bring up a great subject which is the new mid-size sedan which is going to be unlike anything that Volkswagen has produced in the past or is producing now. Tell us a little about how it will be different, why it will be different and anything you might throw in there that will tantalize us a little bit?JACOBY: First of all, it's the first car which we are producing in Chattanooga, Tennessee so we are getting even more home in America than we have been in our history before. And it's a car which is tailor-made for the American consumer.It brings all the genes of a Volkswagen into a mid-size sedan. It's bigger than our previous vehicles, and it's made for the American roads but it has all the attitudes of the German autobahn as well.LEVIN: Have you driven it yet? Have you - is there a prototype?JACOBY: I have driven prototypes in South Africa and in Sweden and in Finland with different weather conditions, and we are very optimistic that this will be a very competitive vehicle.LEVIN: Does it have a name yet?JACOBY: It has a name but unfortunately I cannot announce it yet.LEVIN: Thanks very much for that. And so the automobile market in the U.S. has been stronger in the last couple of months.JACOBY: Yes.LEVIN: Can you tell us what you're feeling now, particularly in March, where there were some discounts by Toyota?JACOBY: Our longer view term which is called quietly optimistic we are. We had a very good start in this year. We grew compared to the first two months by more than 35 percent. That's a very good start in the year, and I can tell you March will be as good as the previous month as well.We have very positive feedback from the dealers as well. We believe, and we always believed, that the U.S. market will recover. Now the recovery starts. It will start slowly, and it will bring us maybe to 11.5 million vehicles this year.LEVIN: Stefan, thank you very, very much for being with us.JACOBY: Thank you.LEVIN: We have been with Stefan Jacoby, the president and CEO of Volkswagen of America.JACOBY: Thank you.LEVIN: Thanks, Stefan.JACOBY: Doron, thank you.
