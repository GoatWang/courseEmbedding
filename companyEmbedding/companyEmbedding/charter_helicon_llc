A CONSULTING FIRM BUILT TO CHALLENGE THE PARADIGM OF ADVICE
 



Helicon Capital Partners was born out of the idea that objective, creative advice should be universally available to investors.  By attempting to break down the barriers of information, Helicon seeks to inspire intelligent, creative solutions to financial challenges and provide the support necessary for thoughtful, purpose-driven action.  Our name is derived from Mount Helicon in Greece.  On this mountain, there are two scared springs: the Aganippe and the Hippocrene, which were considered to be a home to the Muses.  Over time, Mount Helicon became an emblem of poetical inspiration.










CONNECTING PURPOSE
 
The resources provided by Helicon support the crafting of investment strategies that deliver on the ultimate goal of improving client’s financial lives.






CONNECTING PURPOSE
 
The resources provided by Helicon support the crafting of investment strategies that deliver on the ultimate goal of improving client’s financial lives.


The Financial Service Industry has lost its way in the role that it plays in individual's lives.  Relative performance measures, abstract statistics, and a product-driven mindset, have failed to deliver on underlying question most investors have, "How can I best connect my current and future financial assets with the unique lifestyle I envision." At Helicon, we are committed to assisting with addressing this question given the modern challenges faced by investors.  We aspire empower advisors and their investors to find the greater purpose for their assets.

Knowledge vs. Wisdom is often a difficult line to delineate when it comes to capital markets.At Helicon, our research and analysis is aimed at understanding not just market conditions, but ultimately how those conditions affect investors ability to achieve the financial goals that have been uniquely defined.  










DIFFERIENTIATED APPLICATIONS
 
Practical knowledge from institutional, academic and private wealth best-practices.






DIFFERIENTIATED APPLICATIONS
 
Practical knowledge from institutional, academic and private wealth best-practices.


Creativity fashioned from a diverse background and knowledge base, Helicon Capital Partners is at the forefront of developing bespoke applications that first deconstruct academically accepted practices, and then re-purposes them for unique client needs.

Complex financial needs demand the elegant integration of complementary ideas and products .

Complex financial needs demand the elegant integration of complementary ideas and products .


Elegant Solutions often have a fundamental simplicity which provides clarity of thought and direction.  At Helicon, our mission is to help facilitate that elegance through intellectual diversity and authentic concern of finding a "solution" and not just a sale.  True investment solutions span multiple fields of study including economics, finance, psychology, and humanities.  We focus on the intersection of these disciplines when consulting on strategies to address broad financial issues.

Our Strategic Partnerships leverage the experience, knowledge and industry relationships that the team at Helicon has built.   The primary focus of Helicon is to assist with the building of “enterprise value”: the economic value that an investor captures from owning the equity of a company. Our backgrounds include boutique investment consulting, asset management, integrated financial planning, and strategic marketing, and span institutional, corporate and high net worth relationships.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
