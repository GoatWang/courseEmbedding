Before you can finish typing “Monsanto employees” into Google, the search engine suggests “Monsanto evil.” 
The world’s largest-grossing seed seller ranks between one and 15 on any list of the world’s most-hated corporations. The annual “March Against Monsanto,” world-wide protests against genetic modification, drew an estimated two million people in some 400 cities last year.
Caught in this food fight is Brett Begemann, Monsanto’s mild-mannered president and chief operating officer since last October, the son of a farmer who looks like a fellow you’d see winning a produce contest at the state fair. 
“The biotech-derived products that we eat are the most highly tested and regulated components in what we consume,” Begemann says. A new seed must be reviewed by the Department of Agriculture. 
Then there’s a voluntary check from the Food and Drug Administration. If the GM seed includes insecticides or pesticides, as most do, the Environmental Protection Agency gets a look. It takes about $100 million to get one seed from discovery to market. Crops that are bred conventionally, on the other hand, undergo no government testing. None.
Begemann takes personally the charge that Monsanto is poisoning food. 
“It just blows my mind,” he says, “that anybody would ever imagine that I would ever be involved in producing any kind of food that would ever put me, my family or now a grandson at risk.” He adds: “I go to the same grocery store that everybody else goes to.”
He talks about “having a dialogue” and “coming to the table” with those concerned about genetic modification. It remains to be seen if that strategy will quell a backlash based mostly on fear and emotion.

Bravo! I am so glad more light is being shed on this topic! Consumers need more education on the benefits of Monsanto.

bullshit… no allusion to the fact that the earth is dead after any use of pesticides such as the Round Up, and to the fact that farmers are financially dependant of Monsanto, without any possibility to move from genetic agriculture to organic agriculture in a reasonable delay…

Ambassador of Ukraine to the U.S. Olexander Motsyk meets with Mr. Brett D. Begemann, President and Chief Operating Officer of Monsanto Company




        05 March 2015, 20:25    

Embassy of Ukraine in the United States of America


On March 4, 2015 Ambassador of Ukraine to the U.S. Olexander Motsyk met with Mr. Brett D. Begemann, President and Chief Operating Officer of Monsanto Company.    

The Ambassador informed American businessman about the current political, social and economic situation in Ukraine. He underlined that the Government of Ukraine, despite the situation in the East is ready to provide the most favorable conditions for investment projects in the agricultural sector of our country. Ambassador Motsyk also elaborated on the significant export and investment opportunities of Ukrainian agricultural sector.
At the same time, the Ambassador emphasized on the powerful agricultural potential of our country, which owns 25% of world’s black soil and is fairly considered the «breadbasket of Europe». He mentioned the significant investment opportunities of Ukrainian agricultural sector for American companies, as well as export prospects of Ukrainian agricultural products. Ukraine is one of the few countries in the world that has almost ideal conditions for agriculture and is able in a foreseen future to double food production that is especially important in the context of strengthening world food security, said O.Motsyk.
In his turn, Mr.Begemann provided information on the current state and prospects of expansion of «Monsanto» projects in Ukraine particularly increase of modern agricultural equipment and technology sales for the processing and storage of agricultural products. «Monsanto» is ready not only to expand mutually beneficial cooperation with Ukrainian farmers, but also to facilitate implementation of reforms in Ukrainian agriculture, especially in its private sector.
In conclusion, O.Motsyk informed about the Ukrainian-American Agrarian Congress, which is to be held on March 24, 2015 in Washington, DC with the participation of the Minister of agrarian policy and food of Ukraine Oleksiy Pavlenko. He also invited the representatives of «Monsanto» to take part in this event.
