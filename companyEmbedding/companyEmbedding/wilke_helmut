Helmut Willke - Wikipedia





















 






Helmut Willke

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Helmut Willke (born 30 May 1945, Tailfingen) is a German sociologist who studies the effect of globalization on modern society.[1] He coined the term Atopia to denote a society that exists without borders, with no national identity.[2] He is currently professor at Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen, Germany. Helmut Willke has been teaching planning and decision theory since 1983 in the University of Bielfeld’s department of sociology, and state theory and global governance since 2002. He also holds visiting professorships in Washington, D.C., Geneva and Vienna. His main areas of interest and praxis are in systems theory, state theory, global governance and global regime building; organizational development, systems dynamics and systems guidance; and knowledge management (introduction, instruments, strategies). He participated in Social Trends Institute's Experts Meeting "Family Policies in the Western Countries".
