Short Interest Expands By 25.6% For RWT
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 10/14/2016 settlement date, which shows a 329,320 share increase in total short interest for Redwood Trust Inc , to 1,614,281, an increase of 25.63% since 09/30/2016.

Top Buys by Directors: Hughes's $241.2K Bet on RWT
The directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when directors make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason a director of a company would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

					Full Description



Redwood Trust, Inc., incorporated on April 11, 1994, through its subsidiaries, focuses on investing in mortgage and other real estate related assets. The Company is engaged in mortgage banking activities. The Company operates through three segments: Residential Investments, Residential Mortgage Banking and Commercial. The Company's Residential Investments segment includes a portfolio of investments in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) retained from its Sequoia securitizations, as well as RMBS issued by third parties and other credit risk-related investments. In addition, the Residential Investments segment includes a subsidiary of the Company that is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (FHLBC) and that utilizes long-term financing from the FHLBC to make long-term investments directly in residential mortgage loans. The Residential Investments segment invests in mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) associated with residential loans that it has sold or securitized, as well as MSRs that it purchased from third parties.The Company's Residential Mortgage Banking segment consists of operating a mortgage loan conduit that acquires residential loans from third-party originators for subsequent sale, securitization, or transfer to its investment portfolio. It acquires prime, jumbo mortgages and the related mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis from its network of loan sellers and distributes those loans through its Sequoia private-label securitization program or to institutions that acquire pools of whole loans. It supplements its flow purchases with bulk loan acquisitions. The Residential Mortgage Banking segment also includes various derivative financial instruments that it utilizes to manage certain risks associated with residential loans it acquires. Its Residential Mortgage Banking segment focuses on mortgage banking activities, which include valuation increases (or gains) on the sale or securitization of loans, and from hedges used to manage risks associated with these activities.The Company's Commercial segment consists of investments in multi-family securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities, as well as a remaining commercial loan investment following the sale of the remainder of its commercial mezzanine loan portfolio. This Commercial segment's source of revenue is net interest income.The Company competes with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
