Jason A Napolitano's Experience
Title: President
               Company: Jay's World Childhood Cancer Foundation Inc
Job Details
               Jay's World is a not-for-profit foundation focusing on improving the quality of life for children and their families who are coping with the day to day struggle that is cancer. Through fundraising efforts Jay's World has awarded college scholarships to more than 60 teens with cancer giving the recipients the opportunity to pursue their dreams. Jay's World has also raised money and found ways to ease the hospital experience of children with cancer and their families by improving medical facilities and making the hospital stay more comfortable. The idea for Jay's World was sparked by a life-altering event in 1993 when, says founder Ralph Napolitano, ï¿½God pitched us a curve ball.ï¿½ That year, Ralph and MaryAnn Napolitano's oldest son, Jason (nicknamed Jay, now 26 years old), was diagnosed with Leukemia just before his 14 th birthday. The diagnosis came, the Napolitanos say, as a complete surprise ï¿½ Jason was a healthy active teenager and a five-star athlete, with prowess in soccer, football, wrestling, basketball and baseball. ï¿½This was nothing we could ever have imagined,ï¿½ says MaryAnn Napolitano. For three and a half years Ralph and MaryAnn watched and prayed as Jason suffered through being hospitalized, the effects of chemotherapy including more than 30 invasive spinal taps, kidney stones, migraines, blurred vision, appendicitis and respiratory problems. He was hospitalized for months at a time, leaving Jay's parents to turn to their faith. ï¿½I told God that if he would help my kid, I would find a way to help other kids,ï¿½ MaryAnn remembers. How? They weren't sure, until one evening, at home, MaryAnn said they received ï¿½a sign.ï¿½ A phone call from a woman named Angel asked the Napolitanos to donate $1 to the St. Jude's Children's Hospital ï¿½ here, said MaryAnn, was the sign she was looking for ï¿½ an ï¿½angel' asking me to help kids,ï¿½ she smiles. The Napolitanos have always been philanthropists and helped their community members; they sent money to St. Jude's but began to hatch a plan to do more. How could they raise more money than they were able to give from their own pockets to help children?

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!
