Walter W. Driver, Jr. President, United States Golf Association Retired Chairman, King and Spalding speaks at Terry Third Thursday


“Leading the USGA”
Walter W. Driver Jr., 60, of Atlanta, Ga., was elected to a one-year term as president of the United States Golf Association in February 2006. He heads the USGA's professional staff and nearly 1,400 volunteers who serve on more than 30 committees.
Driver recently resigned after six years as chairman and chief executive of King & Spalding, an Atlanta-based law firm with more than 800 lawyers internationally, where he worked since 1970. Late in January, he began his new position as Southeast chairman of Goldman, Sachs and Co., a leading global investment banking and securities firm.
He is a 1967 graduate of Stanford University and a 1970 graduate of the University of Texas Law School. He began his service to the USGA's executive committee as general counsel in 1997 and was named to the committee two years later. He served two years as treasurer and the last four years as vice president.
A competitive golfer, he earned three letters at Stanford and more recently qualified for the 1982 and 1984 U.S. Mid-Amateur Championships. He and his wife, Bettie, have three adult children: Eleanor, Anna and Walter.
Driver's election and that of the full executive committee took place Feb. 4 at the USGA's Annual Meeting in Atlanta. Driver succeeded Fred S. Ridley of Tampa, Fla.
As golf's governing body in this country, the USGA works closely with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland, to produce a uniform code of Rules of Golf that are observed worldwide. The organization's most visible role, however, is played out each season in conducting 13 national championships, including the U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open and U.S. Senior Open. The other 10 national championships are exclusively for amateurs, and include the U.S. Amateur and the U.S. Women's Amateur.
