Biography

COMPANY STATEMENT
The mission of Theravance Biopharma (Nasdaq: TBPH) is to create value from a unique and diverse set of assets: an approved product; a development pipeline of late-stage assets; and a productive research platform designed for long-term growth.
Our pipeline of internally discovered product candidates includes potential best-in-class opportunities in underserved markets in the acute care setting, representing multiple opportunities for value creation. VIBATIV® (telavancin), our first commercial product, is a once-daily dualmechanism antibiotic approved in the U.S. and Europe for difficult-to-treat infections. TD-4208 is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) being developed as a potential once-daily, nebulized treatment for COPD. Axelopran (TD-1211) is an investigational potential once-daily, oral treatment for opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Our earlier-stage clinical assets represent novel approaches for potentially treating diseases of the lung and gastrointestinal tract and infectious disease. In addition, we have an economic interest in future payments that may be made by GSK pursuant to its agreements with Theravance, Inc. relating to certain drug programs, including the combination of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol (or the “Closed Triple”). Theravance Biopharma, Inc. became an independent, publicly-held corporation in June 2014 in connection with its spin-off from Theravance, Inc. Theravance Biopharma, Inc. trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol TBPH.
