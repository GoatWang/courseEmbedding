Career[edit]
Faber was born in Zurich and schooled in Geneva, where he raced for the Swiss National Ski Team (B-Team).[1] He studied economics at the University of Zurich and, at the age of 24, earned a Ph.D. in Economics, graduating magna cum laude.[5]
During the 1970s, Faber worked for White Weld & Company Limited in New York City, Zurich, and Hong Kong. He moved to Hong Kong in 1973. He was a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Ltd Hong Kong[6] from the beginning of 1978 until the firm's collapse in 1990. In 1990, he set up his own business, Marc Faber Limited. Faber now resides in Chiang Mai, Thailand, though he keeps a small office in Hong Kong.[7]
Investment views[edit]
In 1980s[edit]
Faber is credited for advising his clients to get out of the stock market before the October 1987 crash.[8]
In 2000s[edit]
Faber predicted the rise of oil, precious metals, other commodities, emerging markets, and especially China in his book Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery. He stated that there are few value investments available, except for farmland and real estate in some emerging markets like Russia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[9]
He also expressed temporary bullishness for the U.S. dollar in mid-2008, before it dramatically recovered and positive expectations for holding the Japanese yen.[10][11] In December 2008, Faber said, "I think a recovery will not come in the next couple of years, maybe in five, 10 years' time".[12] Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose by 48% from 865.58 on January 1, 2009 to 1282.62 on January 1, 2011.[13]
In 2009, Faber predicted with full confidence that the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping interest rates near zero would lead to hyperinflation approaching levels seen in Zimbabwe.[14] Subsequently, annual increases in the CPI were 2.7% in 2009, 1.5% in 2010, 3.0% in 2011, 1.7% in 2012, 1.5% in 2013, 0.8% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2015.[15] Inflation in Zimbabwe peaked at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008.
In 2010s[edit]
In 2012, Faber claimed that there was a "100% chance" of a global economic recession later that year or in early 2013.[16][17] Subsequently, the average world product grew steadily by 3.4% in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014, and 3.5% in 2015.
In 2012, Faber predicted that the S&P 500 index would fall at least 20% within 6–9 months following the re-election of Barack Obama.[18] Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose from a low of 1359.88 on November 16, 2012 to 1480.40 as of January 1, 2013, 1570.70 on April 1, 2013 (up 15% from the November low, 6 months after Faber's prediction), 1668.68 on July 1, 2013 (up 22% from the November 2012 low) and 1783.54 on November 1, 2013 (up 31%).,[19][20]
On March 27, 2013, Faber said that the U.S. is creating nowhere-to-hide bubbles in many emerging economies such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand (up four times from 2009 lows).[21]
On September 23, 2014, Faber said we have "bubbles everywhere".[22]
On January 14, 2015, Faber predicted that gold prices will rise by 30% in 2015.[23] Gold prices subsequently fell by 14% from $1234 on January 14, 2015 to $1060 on December 31, 2015.[24]
On July 23, 2015, Faber stated that investors must hold cash for better buying opportunities after correction.[25]
Writings[edit]
Faber writes the monthly paper investment newsletter The Gloom Boom & Doom Report, as well as the online subscription letter "Monthly Market Commentary". He has also authored several books, such as The Great Money Illusion; The Confusion Of The Confusions (1988), Riding the Millennial Storm: Marc Faber's Path to Profit in the Financial Markets (1998) and Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery (2010).
Faber has been a contributor to Forbes[26][27] and International Wealth (a sister publication of the Financial Times).[28] He has contributed regularly to several websites such as Financial Intelligence, Asian Bond Portal, Die Welt, Finanzen, Boerse, AME Info, Swiss Radio, Apple Hong Kong and Taiwan, Quamnet, Winners, Wealth and Oriental Daily. He has also written occasionally for the International Herald Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and Borsa e Finanza.[28]
Faber has been long term bearish about the American economy for a number of years, and continues to be so. He concluded his June 2008 newsletter with the following mock quote:

"The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate. If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part."

Faber is credited for advising his clients to get out of the stock market before the October 1987 crash.[8]
In 2000s[edit]
Faber predicted the rise of oil, precious metals, other commodities, emerging markets, and especially China in his book Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery. He stated that there are few value investments available, except for farmland and real estate in some emerging markets like Russia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[9]
He also expressed temporary bullishness for the U.S. dollar in mid-2008, before it dramatically recovered and positive expectations for holding the Japanese yen.[10][11] In December 2008, Faber said, "I think a recovery will not come in the next couple of years, maybe in five, 10 years' time".[12] Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose by 48% from 865.58 on January 1, 2009 to 1282.62 on January 1, 2011.[13]
In 2009, Faber predicted with full confidence that the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping interest rates near zero would lead to hyperinflation approaching levels seen in Zimbabwe.[14] Subsequently, annual increases in the CPI were 2.7% in 2009, 1.5% in 2010, 3.0% in 2011, 1.7% in 2012, 1.5% in 2013, 0.8% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2015.[15] Inflation in Zimbabwe peaked at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008.
In 2010s[edit]
In 2012, Faber claimed that there was a "100% chance" of a global economic recession later that year or in early 2013.[16][17] Subsequently, the average world product grew steadily by 3.4% in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014, and 3.5% in 2015.
In 2012, Faber predicted that the S&P 500 index would fall at least 20% within 6–9 months following the re-election of Barack Obama.[18] Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose from a low of 1359.88 on November 16, 2012 to 1480.40 as of January 1, 2013, 1570.70 on April 1, 2013 (up 15% from the November low, 6 months after Faber's prediction), 1668.68 on July 1, 2013 (up 22% from the November 2012 low) and 1783.54 on November 1, 2013 (up 31%).,[19][20]
On March 27, 2013, Faber said that the U.S. is creating nowhere-to-hide bubbles in many emerging economies such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand (up four times from 2009 lows).[21]
On September 23, 2014, Faber said we have "bubbles everywhere".[22]
On January 14, 2015, Faber predicted that gold prices will rise by 30% in 2015.[23] Gold prices subsequently fell by 14% from $1234 on January 14, 2015 to $1060 on December 31, 2015.[24]
On July 23, 2015, Faber stated that investors must hold cash for better buying opportunities after correction.[25]
Writings[edit]
Faber writes the monthly paper investment newsletter The Gloom Boom & Doom Report, as well as the online subscription letter "Monthly Market Commentary". He has also authored several books, such as The Great Money Illusion; The Confusion Of The Confusions (1988), Riding the Millennial Storm: Marc Faber's Path to Profit in the Financial Markets (1998) and Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery (2010).
Faber has been a contributor to Forbes[26][27] and International Wealth (a sister publication of the Financial Times).[28] He has contributed regularly to several websites such as Financial Intelligence, Asian Bond Portal, Die Welt, Finanzen, Boerse, AME Info, Swiss Radio, Apple Hong Kong and Taiwan, Quamnet, Winners, Wealth and Oriental Daily. He has also written occasionally for the International Herald Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and Borsa e Finanza.[28]
Faber has been long term bearish about the American economy for a number of years, and continues to be so. He concluded his June 2008 newsletter with the following mock quote:

"The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate. If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part."

Career[edit]
Faber was born in Zurich and schooled in Geneva, where he raced for the Swiss National Ski Team (B-Team).[1] He studied economics at the University of Zurich and, at the age of 24, earned a Ph.D. in Economics, graduating magna cum laude.[5]
During the 1970s, Faber worked for White Weld & Company Limited in New York City, Zurich, and Hong Kong. He moved to Hong Kong in 1973. He was a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Ltd Hong Kong[6] from the beginning of 1978 until the firm's collapse in 1990. In 1990, he set up his own business, Marc Faber Limited. Faber now resides in Chiang Mai, Thailand, though he keeps a small office in Hong Kong.[7]

Wall Street isn’t ready for a 1,100-point tumble in the Dow industrials
              
              The U.S. stock market is on such a parabolic march higher that Wall Street investors may have forgotten what a typical daily downturn feels like anymore.

Oil logs its biggest weekly gain of the year
              
              Oil log a weekly gain of more than 8%—the largest such rise since early December, with prices getting a lift from renewed production-curb commitments from OPEC members as well as uncertainty in Venezuela.

Treasury yields slide after second-quarter GDP data
              
              Treasury prices recovered, making up for lost ground on Friday, lowering yields after second-quarter economic data made a strong showing, but a lack of accompanying inflation and wage growth throws doubt into the case for an additional rate increase.

              Gold builds on a weekly gain Friday buoyed by reports of a fresh missile test in North Korea, as the U.S. dollar holds on to losses even after a U.S. GDP report delivered the stronger reading that most economists had banked on.

Faber: Some day Tesla, Amazon and Netflix will fall 10%

Bloomberg News



Marc Faber, managing director of Marc Faber Ltd., warns that U.S. stocks are looking a lot like they did in 1999. 

Famed investor Marc Faber, known as Dr. Doom for his gloomy views, believes the U.S. markets are in the midst of a gigantic bubble and when the day of reckoning comes, investors will likely lose half of their money.  “There is a bubble in everything. Nothing in asset price is very low,” said Faber during an interview on CNBC Wednesday. His grim prognosis shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to permabear Faber over the years. Still, the fact that his latest warning comes on the heels of a historic rally that has propelled stocks to records lends some urgency to his grim outlook.  “We are somewhere between 1999 to 2000,” he said, referring to the tech bubble and its subsequent collapse.  “One day this bubble will end,” said Faber. When that happens, people will lose 50% of their assets. Concerns about elevated valuations in the U.S. have been mounting given the S&P 500

                                         double-digit gains since November on hopes that President Donald Trump’s presidency will usher in a more business-friendly climate. “I don’t disagree Trump is good for the markets and economy but some of his statements and actions are not favorable for the U.S.,” said Faber.  Indeed, the euphoria that has gripped the market since the November presidential election has faded as Trump struggles to enact many of his promised policies. Yet, most analysts still believe the bullish market thesis remains intact.  Not so Faber. He thinks consumption is relatively weak for this stage of the economic recovery and predicted that as financial-asset prices rise, wages will deflate and the U.S. economy will further weaken. All that said, nothing would make him bullish on the U.S. market. Faber believes there will come a day when technology giants Tesla Inc.

                                         will fall 10% in a single session. All three have outperformed the broader market, helping the Nasdaq Composite

                                         to gain nearly 20% over the past six months.  One of the first warnings signals that the market is shifting will be when volatility picks up. But even the lack of volatility has managed to perplex the Switzerland-based investor. “I do not understand why volatility is so low but when stocks go up as volatility goes up, that will be a sign that something is changing,” he said.  The CBOE Volatility Index 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    VIX, +3.86%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         which measures investors’ expectation for volatility over the coming 30 days, has been eerily subdued with the monthly average of 10.89 in May the lowest since November 2006, according to Dow Jones Data Group.  Faber, meanwhile, likes U.S. Treasurys, given they guarantee a “certain yield” and particularly given the near-zero interest rates in Japan and much of Europe.  But Treasurys may be the only U.S. asset to escape his disdain, even if arguably they are facing their own bubble. He prefers European assets and gold and 90% of his investment in stocks and bonds are emerging markets.

            Further A-share declines coming: Marc Faber   
			                        Tuesday, 14 Jul 2015 | 12:35  AM ET |  06:36 




  Famously bearish investor Marc Faber says he wouldn't touch Chinese stocks even after their precipitous decline, instead pushing the investment case for Vietnam equities, Hong Kong-listed Macau gaming stocks and gold mining shares. 
"I am a buyer when markets are undervalued and attractive and then I get out relatively early. So we were buyers a year ago in June/July of 2014," Faber, the author of the "Gloom, Boom and Doom Report", said, referring to Chinese equities. "Now, I don't think that Chinese stocks are attractive and I would just stand aside."
Chinese equities have taken a severe beating in the recent weeks as panic selling gripped the market, but stability appears to have returned after a series of series of government measures to shore up investor confidence. The benchmark Shanghai Composite is down 24 percent from its June 12 peak, but up 21 percent on a year-to-date basis.

Faber contends that growth in world's second largest economy has "slowed down to trickle", adding that 6-7 percent growth is a "pipe dream."

  China, which has set its own growth target at about 7 percent for 2015, is due to publish its latest gross domestic product (GDP) report on Wednesday . The release is expected to show growth dipped below 7 percent in the second quarter, following 7 percent expansion in the first quarter of 2015 - the weakest showing since the global financial crisis. 
  "We just heard from the Australian treasurer that growth this year in China will be 6.75 percent. It's a pipe dream that will never materialize. Maybe that will be published by the government but the reality is that Chinese growth has slowed down to trickle," he said. 
  Rather than betting on Chinese A-shares, Faber makes the case for equity investments elsewhere in the region, including Vietnam stocks, which are up 16 percent this year.  
  Vietnam is the one country that "stands out in Asia", with its strong economic performance and reasonably priced stocks, he said. "In Vietnam you could have a similar situation as in China a year ago, where stocks went up very substantially."  
  Also  on his buy-list are Macau casino stocks. "After a very substantial decline, I think they have reached a buying range," Faber said, cautioning, however, that they "may still go lower somewhat" from here.  
  Lastly, Faber is also keen on precious metals, including platinum, silver and gold and their related shares.  
  "Gold shares, they may still move somewhat lower, but if you ask me what is good value, the gold mining sector is a depressed sector."

            China GDP is really growing at 4%: Dr. Doom   
			                        Monday, 18 Jan 2016 |  8:47  PM ET |  04:16 




  China's economy isn't growing anywhere near as fast as official figures suggest, perma-bear Marc Faber, told CNBC on Tuesday.  
    Speaking before the release of heavily anticipated Chinese growth figures for 2015, Faber, the publisher of The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, put the country's growth at about 4 percent, far from the 7 percent Beijing was aiming for, or the 6.9 percent it achieved.
    "An economy is very complex and you have some sectors of an economy expanding and some sectors contracting," Faber told CNBC's Squawk Box. But he added, "My sense is that at very best, the economy is growing at around 4 percent per annum but it could be lower."

Gross domestic product (GDP) growth on the mainland slowed to 6.9 percent in 2015, a 25-year low, figured released on Tuesday showed. Fourth-quarter GDP came in at 6.8 percent. 
 Both numbers were in line with expectations, but China's reported economic data routinely meets with skepticism. 
 "There are numerous indicators and some of them are actually reliable, if you look at say imports and exports, from Taiwan and South Korea into China. You get the sense that the economy is actually quite weak," Faber said. 
 Last week China said exports fell 1.4 percent in December from a year earlier, while imports slid 7.6 percent, both much less than economists had expected, but still marking a sixth straight on-year exports decline.
 Additionally, Faber cited concerns about debt in China as support for a bearish position.
"We have this colossal debt bubble in China and in my opinion this will have to be deflated through either huge losses in the banking sector or losses in the bond market for investors," he said.

China's total outstanding external debt was at $1.53 trillion at the end of September, according to official data.
    "In addition to that, we have essentially a stock market bubble, which now is being deflated," Faber said.. 
    The Shanghai Composite has entered "bear within a bear" territory, falling more than 20 percent from its December high, as well as trading down more than 40 percent from its 52-week high set in June of last year. The benchmark index closed up 3 percent on Tuesday

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Product Description
Marc Faber – Tomorrows Gold. Asias Age of Discovery

 
Renowned investment advisor Marc Faber sets out to find tomorrow s gold the outperforming asset classes of the future. Far from being a sensational reading of the runes, this book delves deep into the past, to chart how old investor trends developed and assess how new patterns might emerge. Change is the thread. As Faber points out, the world is experiencing a transformation as great as Europe s late-15th Century golden age of discovery and the Industrial Revolution of the19th Century events that altered the commercial face of the Earth forever.<P><P>And from this dramatic landscape a world in which economic, social and political conditions are morphing at an alarming rate Faber identifies investment opportunities.<P><P>Asia s three-billion-strong population will have a profound effect on the world, writes Faber, cautioning that today s richest cities and clusters of wealth are unlikely to retain their exalted positions in the future.

Career[edit]
Faber was born in Zurich and schooled in Geneva, where he raced for the Swiss National Ski Team (B-Team).[1] He studied economics at the University of Zurich and, at the age of 24, earned a Ph.D. in Economics, graduating magna cum laude.[5]
During the 1970s, Faber worked for White Weld & Company Limited in New York City, Zurich, and Hong Kong. He moved to Hong Kong in 1973. He was a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Ltd Hong Kong[6] from the beginning of 1978 until the firm's collapse in 1990. In 1990, he set up his own business, Marc Faber Limited. Faber now resides in Chiang Mai, Thailand, though he keeps a small office in Hong Kong.[7]
Investment views[edit]
In 1980s[edit]
Faber is credited for advising his clients to get out of the stock market before the October 1987 crash.[8]
In 2000s[edit]
Faber predicted the rise of oil, precious metals, other commodities, emerging markets, and especially China in his book Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery. He stated that there are few value investments available, except for farmland and real estate in some emerging markets like Russia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.[9]
He also expressed temporary bullishness for the U.S. dollar in mid-2008, before it dramatically recovered and positive expectations for holding the Japanese yen.[10][11] In December 2008, Faber said, "I think a recovery will not come in the next couple of years, maybe in five, 10 years' time".[12] Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose by 48% from 865.58 on January 1, 2009 to 1282.62 on January 1, 2011.[13]
In 2009, Faber predicted with full confidence that the Federal Reserve's policy of keeping interest rates near zero would lead to hyperinflation approaching levels seen in Zimbabwe.[14] Subsequently, annual increases in the CPI were 2.7% in 2009, 1.5% in 2010, 3.0% in 2011, 1.7% in 2012, 1.5% in 2013, 0.8% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2015.[15] Inflation in Zimbabwe peaked at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008.
In 2010s[edit]
In 2012, Faber claimed that there was a "100% chance" of a global economic recession later that year or in early 2013.[16][17] Subsequently, the average world product grew steadily by 3.4% in each of 2012, 2013 and 2014, and 3.5% in 2015.
In 2012, Faber predicted that the S&P 500 index would fall at least 20% within 6–9 months following the re-election of Barack Obama.[18] Subsequently, the S&P 500 index rose from a low of 1359.88 on November 16, 2012 to 1480.40 as of January 1, 2013, 1570.70 on April 1, 2013 (up 15% from the November low, 6 months after Faber's prediction), 1668.68 on July 1, 2013 (up 22% from the November 2012 low) and 1783.54 on November 1, 2013 (up 31%).,[19][20]
On March 27, 2013, Faber said that the U.S. is creating nowhere-to-hide bubbles in many emerging economies such as Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand (up four times from 2009 lows).[21]
On September 23, 2014, Faber said we have "bubbles everywhere".[22]
On January 14, 2015, Faber predicted that gold prices will rise by 30% in 2015.[23] Gold prices subsequently fell by 14% from $1234 on January 14, 2015 to $1060 on December 31, 2015.[24]
On July 23, 2015, Faber stated that investors must hold cash for better buying opportunities after correction.[25]
Writings[edit]
Faber writes the monthly paper investment newsletter The Gloom Boom & Doom Report, as well as the online subscription letter "Monthly Market Commentary". He has also authored several books, such as The Great Money Illusion; The Confusion Of The Confusions (1988), Riding the Millennial Storm: Marc Faber's Path to Profit in the Financial Markets (1998) and Tomorrow's Gold: Asia's Age of Discovery (2010).
Faber has been a contributor to Forbes[26][27] and International Wealth (a sister publication of the Financial Times).[28] He has contributed regularly to several websites such as Financial Intelligence, Asian Bond Portal, Die Welt, Finanzen, Boerse, AME Info, Swiss Radio, Apple Hong Kong and Taiwan, Quamnet, Winners, Wealth and Oriental Daily. He has also written occasionally for the International Herald Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and Borsa e Finanza.[28]
Faber has been long term bearish about the American economy for a number of years, and continues to be so. He concluded his June 2008 newsletter with the following mock quote:

"The federal government is sending each of us a $600 rebate. If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, the money goes to China. If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs. If we buy a computer it will go to India. If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala. If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany. If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy. The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer, since these are the only products still produced in US. I've been doing my part."
