We are offering 10,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will
receive from the sale of the private placement warrants and private units will
be used as set forth in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their  
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
                                                              
(2 A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a loan
   from our sponsor described below. These amounts will be repaid upon 
   completion of this offering.                                               

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions on a certain
    portion of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our 
    initial business combination, $3,500,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriters from the
    funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to
    us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the 
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest 
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.            

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated 
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect 
    approximately $44,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the 
    funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current 
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.        

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units
and private placement warrants, $110,000,000 (or approximately $125,000,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including
$3,500,000 of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and
will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account
will be approximately $22,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per
year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held
in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or
working capital expenses, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares and
private shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of law).
Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the
funds in the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial
portion of working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

On or prior to the date of this prospectus, we will enter into an Administrative
Services Agreement pursuant to which we will pay CIBL a total of $10,000 per
month for office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to
the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a
determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside
the trust account to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with an
initial business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without
interest and either be due and payable no later than the date of the
consummation of an initial business combination, or, at CIBL’s option, treated
as working capital loans and be convertible into additional warrants on terms
identical to the private placement warrants. If we do not consummate an initial
business combination, any accrued amounts would be forgiven. Upon completion of
our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

As of March 31, 2016, our sponsor has loaned us $150,000 pursuant to a
promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This
loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of August 31,
2016, the closing of this offering or the date we determine not to proceed with
the offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, the holder of the private shares
would be entitled to exercise redemption rights and share in any liquidating
distributions we make with respect to such private shares. Additionally, if our
sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer


 to
throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not
identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on
our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with
any business combination target.

Nevada PMV Acquisition Holding Company, LLC, our sponsor, is majority-owned by
CIBL (OTC Pink®: CIBY). CIBL’s holdings primarily consists of cash and cash
equivalents and a 43% ownership interest in ICTC Group, Inc., a provider of
broadband and voice communications services.
---

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector
or geographical location, we intend to focus on industries that complement our
management team’s backgrounds and professional networks identify and acquire a
business within the global telecommunications, media, entertainment, technology,
industrial or consumer markets. We intend to focus on companies that are either
non-core divisions of public or private companies, private equity-owned and
other privately-owned businesses, both domestically and internationally. We will
seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $250 million to $500 million. In general, we will seek to acquire
a readily understood business with sustainable competitive advantages,
predictable cash flows and a solid management team at an attractive valuation.
