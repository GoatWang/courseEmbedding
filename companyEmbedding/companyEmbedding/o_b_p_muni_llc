State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?
06/21/2017

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.

﻿﻿Remote Oil Filters & Oil Coolers Designed For Motorcycl﻿es.﻿﻿



PLEASE NOTE: We are upgrading our website in order to offer even further options and easier site navigation. As we go through the invariable growing pains associated with the upgrade, please don't hesitate to email dan@mooresensible.com or call 262-331-3303 if you have any questions or are unable to find what you need. 
New Product! DB1 Direct to Block adapter﻿(aka "The Garcia Mount")*﻿
Available in raw finish, mirror polished, or Harley-Davidson® Engine Black powder coat.

















 




Although shown with straight fittings here the DB1 will ship with forged brass, 90° fittings in order to better facilitate plumbing to remote filter kit.







 



The DB1 Direct to Block adapter fits '99-'06 Twin Cam "A" engines and eliminates the big, bulky, factory oil filter mount altogether for a really clean look when using one of our remote oil filter kits. Can also be used to replace a broken filter housing when rebuilding a wreck.The DB1 will be available in raw finish, black powdercoat or mirror polished. It will ship with forged brass, 90° fittings pre-installed, Viton© o-rings and stainless steel mounting hardware.﻿*We call it "The Garcia Mount" around here beca﻿us﻿e while I was toying around with the idea, customer and good friend Frank Garcia of Mesquite Nevada (recently of Snohomish, Washington) took the bull by the horns, drew up the part in CAD and had one made for his personal bike by a local machine shop. He was then kind enough to send me the CAD file at no charge. In today's "me, me, me" world it is extremely rare, and quite refreshing, to become associated with someone so selfless. It is much and truly appreciated.

Please Note: On 01/27/2013 the US Postal service raised their rates. 
Shipping will be added at checkout. Domestic packages will be $11.30, regardless of weight, and ship via USPS Priority Mail®. For international rates, please click here. 5.5% sales tax will be added at checkout for WI residents only.
Finally, an absolute end to the mess when changing the oil in your Harley-Davidson® touring bike, and very soon, a line of oil coolers that will cool the wildest of engines. If you can build it, we can cool it.Our kits move the stock oil filter to a much more accessible location, eliminating the hassles with crank position sensors, oil cooler adapters, specialty filter wrenches that still don't work, and the mess in general.  We do our absolute best to offer you the highest quality parts possible and everything possible is Made In America. All of our mounting brackets are precision cut on an OMAX 5555 Waterjet Machining Center  by Direct Waterjet, Inc (www.directwaterjet.com).Our proprietary filter mounts are CNC machined from solid, aircraft quality, 6016-T6 Billet Aluminum. The clamps that route the lines up along the inside of the left frame rail are constructed of that same billet material, although they're done  manually.Each and every one of our kits is tested at 100psi so you can rest assured it is not going to leak when you install it. We'd like to send a special thanks to all of our family and good friends that offered support and encouragement along the way. Most notably Mom & Dad Roberts, Frank & Mary Schmidt, and Donald Shane. We could not possibly have done this without you. 
Please Note: We are not part of, or affiliated with, The Harley-Davidson® Motor Company in any way. We simply ride 'em, wrench 'em, and offer a few sensible parts to help make riding and wrenching more enjoyable.

State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?
06/21/2017

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.
