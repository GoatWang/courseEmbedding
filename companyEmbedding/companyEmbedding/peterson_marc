Peterson: Mark Twain Collection Smooth




Product Number: 002-029-9579


          The previous editions of Peterson's Mark Twain series, released in the 1980s, are greatly prized for their fabulous smoking qualities (particularly with Virginia blends and flakes), and have been known to auction on eBay at daunting prices. This new 2010 edition, marking the 100th anniversary of Samuel Clemens' passing, includes not only the original, legendary Mark Twain design (copied, fittingly enough, from Mark Twain's own much-used pipe, which was itself a Peterson), but also includes a large straight poker inspired by Huck Finn's ever-present corncob. What is offered here, in essence, is not only the original Mark Twain bent billiard, but a smooth-smoking poker to boot, and both together at a price under what the older editions' single pipe has been selling for, for years.

- Eric N. Squires

Peterson: Mark Twain Ebony Tankard Fishtail




Product Number: 002-029-32485


This hearty Poker shape was released as part of a two-pipe set with the Mark Twain bent Billiard. Here on its own, this firm sitter brings to mind the corn cob pipes of Huck Finn, though its classy jet-black finish and nickel accent band make it perfectly suitable as a dress pipe.
