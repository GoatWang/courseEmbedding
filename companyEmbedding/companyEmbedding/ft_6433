We do have suggestions on how you can anchor the shed if you choose to do so in the last section of the instruction manual.

        Decent shed for the money
I bought this on 4/20/2017. It took 2 weeks to be delivered from the department store. It arrives in 4 boxes each of which is like a heavy  twin size bed. The most difficult part was making sure I had everything before I started the assembly. It took about an hour to go through the manual and cross reference all the parts to get an idea where all the parts went. Overall it took me basically by myself took 13 hours to put it together. You only really need another person for 3 parts of the assembly. I assembled my shed on a 11 x 11 concrete slab. Your foundation definitely needs to be level. The shed really looks in person like it does online. This shed stores alot of stuff and has plenty of head room.

Shed took 2 weeks to get delivered and comes in 4 heavy boxes the size of twin mattresses. It took me 13 hours to assemble basically by myself. You do need 1 other person for 3 parts of assembly. It took 1 hour to go through the manual and cross reference all the parts in the 4 boxes. There are a lot of parts. This shed has a lot of head room and can store a lot of stuff. The shed looks in person exactly how it looks online. Very sturdy. I assembled and anchored my shed on a 11 x 11 concrete pad. A concrete pad is highly recommended. I had it poured from a truck and it was not that expensive. I did it myself and watched video online about framing the pad and how it would be poured. Overall cost for everything concrete and shed was $3,000.

It's important to read the instructions a few times before starting, paying close attention to the flooring position when putting up the walls, we had to take all the walls down after installation and rotate floor to accomodate the door stops. Besides that it was pretty easy. It took 2 1/2 people an entire day to put together. It seems very sturdy and weather proof (had a downpour just after assembly was complete) and not a drop of water inside.

        Attractive, Spacious and Functional
Bought this shed about 5 years ago and have no complaints.
This week a lower hinge on the door broke and when I discussed obtaining a replacement part with customer care, they asked for details and shortly after I received an email stating the part was ordered and would be shipped at no cost to me. Excellent customer care, thank you very much.

        Very well designed, with lots of features
This is an excellent shed, with many add on features that one would spend more money on to get later. Examples: Sky lights, windows that open and close, shelving, peg boards, full floor.  I put the shed on a 12 X 12 foot concrete pad, making this much easier than a wood sub-floor.  A few things to expect: The shed took every bit of 8 hours to build with three people.  It is well-designed and requires that much time.  Follow the instructions in exactly the order described.  Failure to do so will almost certainly get one in trouble.  Keep your staging area (the stuff in the boxes) separate from your construction area, and only grab what you need for the step you are working on.  This reduces confusion.

        Love my shed!
Easy and fun to build.  lifetime is a good name for it because it has held up well.  I bought it about 6 years ago.  I had a little trouble with the roof sagging so I called customer service, they asked me to send them a couple of pictures showing the sag.  they gladly sent me a few more roof supports for free and it solved the problem.   I put pea gravel under the shed, that was a big mistake because years of my riding mower going in and out has caused the gravel to bunch up.   Am trying to figure out a plan to slide it off its foundation or disassemble it to replace the pea gravel with crushed rock and re-level it.  Great product though, stays clean also, doesn't attract many insects because of the plastic.

        Storage
I debated over several manufactures of sheds. I found the Lifetime shed to be the best value for my money.  Not only did it arrive at my house in just a few days it was also easy to assemble all you have to do is follow the direction.  I would recommend this product to anyone!

Thanks Lifetime!

Product Description
HIGH QUALITY POOL & SPA REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES

Our generic replacement cartridges are less expensive than the original manufacturers' brands yet still meet the same high quality standards.  The key components of a cartridge - filter media, core, and end cap - are all designed for maximum water flow and cartridge life.
The filter media is point bonded polyester with even fiber distribution which results in an even dirt load and increased water flow.  
The Sharp & Uniform pleated media provides filtration area (square footage) that meets or exceeds the original manufacturers' specifications.  
An open core design provides sturdy support for the media without restricting flow.  Increased flow rates result in less wear on the pump and reduced energy usage.  
Anti-microbial end caps inhibit the growth of bacteria, mold and mildew while supporting the core and media.
Banded Pleats maximize flow during operation, and help to reduce the frequency of cleaning.  Banded pleats also make the cartridge easier to clean.
We carry thousands of generic cartridges to replace all of the most popular OEM brands such as Sta-Rite, Pentair / Pac Fab, Hayward, Purex, American Products, Jacuzzi,  Hot Springs, Coleman, and more.

A great product
I found the instructions easy to follow. I would modify 1 or 2 steps to speed assembly of the roof framing. I was able to on 99% of the assemble by myself. In all this was easy to do and it looks great and meets the need for  purchasing of the building.

Awesome Product and Company!
Ordered the shed on a Sunday and had it in my driveway by the next Friday! Product was shrink wrapped and did not even have a dent on a box. Shipper was top notch! I am pretty handy and watched several you tube videos on the installation ... the videos helped a ton! The screws are all packaged for each section of the instruction, which was very helpful, most of the actual parts did not have part numbers but from watching videos and using common sense the shed went together with ease. 2 men 6 hours fully installed!Would recommend these sheds over any others ... and trust me I researched all of them!Thanks competitive edge!

Great shed!
This is a great shed!  Shed arrived well packaged on a skid shrink wrapped in 4 boxes.  We checked contents of all boxes to ensure all parts were delivered and to inspect for damage.  No problems with missing or damaged parts.  Directions are lacking!  Pictures are included but are hard to make out in some instances.  Better written instructions in support of pictures would be a benefit.  Parts labeling would have helped a great deal!  Separating all parts and stacking with like pieces helped us.  Great fit when assembling shed.  Very solid when finally assembled and anchored to cement slab.  I still have to assemble and install the shelves.  Customer service was extremely courteous and helpful (shed shipped 1 week after it was supposed to).  It took 4 guys 8 hours (1 hour off for lunch) to assemble.  Much of the time figuring out the instructions.  I spent almost 2 hours hammer drilling into the slab to anchor the shed.  I have had great comments on the shed from friends and family.  I would definitely recommend this shed and Competitive Edge!

Superman Of Sheds!
We had the 11x11 along with 2 extension kits shed for 2 years now and recently had a huge 60 ft tall tree fall directly on it. I wish I could attach a picture here to show how well the shed held up. Sure there are supports, roof, and wall panels that need replacing but in all the shed took quite a hit with minimal damage and the contents inside were virtually untouched. Lifetime was extremely helpful with ordering of replacement parts. I can't say enough of how happy we are that we purchased this shed. Not to even mention the fact that this shed requires no maintenance, no wood to rot out over time. We feel this was a great investment! Thanks, Lifetime!

 Q: Is this difficult to put together? Do I need to hire someone?
 Asked by: Customer


 
			  - 2/22/2016

 A: The assembly is quite easy with the exception of the base. If you have a concrete slab, then you are set. If you need to build a wooden base or foundation that can be intimidating. The instructions do show you exactly how to build that so for most people they do not hire it out. Sometimes people will hire out the base for the concrete work only and then assemble the shed. The shed is designed for the homeowner to assemble-in other words, it usually isn't necessary to hire a contractor or handyman to build it. The average person with the help of a friend can complete the assembly on a weekend easily.

Applying radar technology to migratory bird conservation and management: strengthening and expanding a collaborativeProduct Type: Open-file ReportYear: 2007Author(s): Ruth, J.MSuggested Citation: Ruth, J.M. 2007. Applying radar technology to migratory bird conservation and management: strengthening and expanding a collaborative. Open-File Report 2007-1361. U.S. Geological Survey. 86 p. Understanding the factors affecting migratory bird and bat populations during all three phases of their life cycle--breeding, nonbreeding, and migration--is critical to species conservation planning. This included the need for information about these species’ responses to natural challenges, as well as information about the effects of human activities and structures. Habitats and other resources critical to migrants during passage and stopover are being destroyed, degraded, and threatened by human activities. Birds and bats are also uniquely susceptible to human use of the airspace. Wind turbines, communication and power transmission towers, and other tall structures, known to cause bird and bat mortality, are being erected or proposed in increasing numbers across the country. In addition, the potential bird/aircraft collisions poses human safety threats. Management and regulatory agencies, conservation organizations, and industry currently lack the formation they need to meet their missions and statutory responsibilities. The biological data available from various radar technologies offer a unique opportunity to learn more about the spatiotemporal distribution patterns, flight characteristics, and habitat use of “aero-fauna.”

The look and the size are indeed very good, and it is very sturdy. It is the best choice. I would also like to acknowledge Lifetime's customer service. The guy who assembled it said there was a missing part (roof truss). Since it was going to rain, I asked customer service to deliver it sooner even though it was supposed to take 3 days. It arrived over night. One minor thing that needs improvement is the mechanism of the window. Otherwise, the shed is perfect.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsNice shed.ByAmazon Customeron November 25, 2013Verified PurchaseWe like our shed, took some time to put it together but are happy with the product.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsHappy with purchaseByDavidSon November 8, 2011Verified PurchaseInitial delivery was short 3 boxes. Amazon corrected the problem within 3 days of notification.  One person can assemble almost the entire shed but two are needed to do the roof. Putting the shed up took about 16 hours.  Directions were good; doing the inventory would have been easier if the part numbers that are stamped into many of the parts would have been referenced.  The floor outer panels should be identified as those where the doors would be installed, would help to orientate the shed for door placement. One small part was missing; a call to the manufacture got the part to me in 2 days. The shed looks good and seems to be made of good materials.  Only "cheap" parts are window mechanisms and large shelves. There were no leaks after several heavy rains.  The shed platform must be absolutely level, the roof assembly is where any deviations show-up!Read more0Comment|

It has been a year  since I purchased and I have no regrets.  All my garden stuff are  well organised in this storage shed out of the rain sun and snow!  In addition to what was included,  I bought another peg strip from Home Depot  and some pegs so I have maximised the use of the inner walls and inner roof rack. I put in a shelving unit  with castors which I  had before.  I also attached 3 solar lights on the roof so I get  some light in the shed if it gets dark and  I am still out  in the garden and I need to put away stuff.  I also installed a solar powered fan so I get some breeze in there. I also attached some gutters  with a down spout  that throws the water to the lawn.  away from  treated wood  the base which I have placed it on. (Wood base is on concrete floor)  I put on curtains on the windows  and I placed some baking soda from time to time to get rid of any muggy smell, then I  open a can of  air freshener.  I store BBQ grill and party supplies,  patio chairs, lawnmower, edger  powerwasher, unused wheelchair, commode with liner (if my son is in the garden with me) and bicycle  just to name a few and there is still room  Everyone loves it and are amazed just how much stuff is in there with room to spare.  The only down side is  putting it together - this was a nightmare for the guys who  did  it.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsNot all that and a bag of nuts!ByM. Hallon July 16, 2017Verified PurchaseThis is a nice shed.  I think it is a bit flimsier in material than Rubbermaid products cause the walls are not as thick.  It took two handyman multiple calls and videos to figure this shed assembly out.  The instruction booklet discussed parts A and B when the box contained E and F.  The impression we got was they want you to purchase their installers.  Honestly I think it would have been cheaper.  I don't dislike the shed I just don't find it all that and bag of nuts now that it is done and would not buy another.  It is just OK.I will go with an Amish built shed next.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGarden Shed Beaver CasaByJanice Beaveron July 15, 2013Verified PurchaseBought this last summer and never regretted it.  My husband and I put it together and it was a snap.  It looks so nice and we've had several folks stop by and ask us about it.  My husband reinforced the floor by using footers and cdx plywood for underlayment.  Worked wonderful since we knew some of the items to be stored in it would need the added support.  We used decorative stones for the entry way.  We loved this product so much that we just bought another one but a different size(15'x8').Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 stars6433 11'x11' shed reviewByWWAJCIon December 29, 2016Verified PurchaseI built the 6433 last week to replace an old aluminum shed that was too small. The 6433 required a larger base, so I had to add some pavers to extend the patio out some to accommodate the larger footprint. I thought I was careful in making sure the base was nice and level. If possible, I would recommend that you pour a new concrete base (carefully leveled and just an inch or so bigger on each side than the base of the shed). From what I've read and experienced, if you are going to have problems building this shed, it will be caused by a base that's not level.Parts are well labeled and instructions fairly easy to follow. Took me a day and a half to assemble. Everything went smooth until I got to installing last couple of roof panels. They did not immediately align. Lifetime tech support said this is a common problem for DIYers and recommended that I loosen all of the roof and wall screws to allow adjustment, then re tighten. I loosened them, but couldn't realign by hand. I had to use a come-along attached to top of last metal side wall support (run out opposite window and attached to a tree) to pull the truss into proper alignment. Then the last two roof panels fit perfectly.Only other major problem encountered has been aligning the doors. Right door works fine, but left door is too low (about 3/4"). I watched lifetime video on door adjust, which recommended shimming the shed in spots, but that didn't make slightest difference. Still haven't figured out how to fix - I may have to drill new holes in hinge plate, slide entire hinge (and possibly door top plate) up a half inch or so and screw it back in place making new holes.Tips:If you don't want people to be able to look into the shed, leave the opaque film on the plexiglass windows before installing. I don't really see the point of the operable windows anyway. For better security, I'd prefer that the side windows be fixed shut. I don't plan on opening them.Leave truss screws fairly loose until entire roof is on, then tighten them down.Might want to use handheld screwdriver for installing screws into any plastic. Too easy to over torque using a drill with a Phillips bit.Overall, shed seems to be very well designed and instructions easy to follow. I suspect the alignment issues I encountered were from my base not being perfectly flat.Read more0Comment|
