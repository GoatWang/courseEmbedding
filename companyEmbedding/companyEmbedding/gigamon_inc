Gigamon: A Natural Acquisition Target By The Essence Of Its Business - Gigamon, Inc. (NYSE:GIMO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Gigamon: A Natural Acquisition Target By The Essence Of Its BusinessMay.14.17 | About: Gigamon, Inc. (GIMO) Jay Wei Research analyst, activist investor, special situations, long/short equitySummaryGigamon has good products to sell, but it spends too much on direct selling to end users and paying third-party distributors to channel to end users, which squeezes margins.While Gigamon's top line has been growing, the company may have to scale up its business soon if it wants continued growth, something its current level of internal capital cannot support.Merging with a larger network equipment maker or security software company can address both its capital needs for expansion and its sales efficiency via product integration with the acquirer's offerings.Gigamon Inc. (NYSE:GIMO) has a reputable technology and impressive products in network visibility and traffic monitoring, but is being held back by its costly marketing efforts, squeezing operating margins and reducing net earnings. Despite increased attention to cybersecurity, not every network operator may include managing potential security threats as something essential to a network's functions. The company's lower profit margins show that selling cybersecurity-related products to one end user at a time proves to be no easy task. To state specifically, part of Gigamon's current sales structure involves selling directly to end users of network operators as a security add-on to their existing network infrastructure. This kind of retailing hasn't been the most efficient for the company, given the level of marketing costs associated with it. Developing wholesale customers, namely network equipment makers and security software companies, or better yet, becoming a part of them, stands a better chance to realize Gigamon's sales and earnings potential. With changes in its sales structure or an acquisition to provide integrated network security offerings, its products could reach a far wider base of network operators, and so would its stock, potentially fetching a higher valuation. Technology companies are supposed to have high-margin operations if they don't squander too much on administrative and marketing expenses. Gigamon had a trailing 12-month gross margin of 82.34%, but its operating margin dropped deeply down to 6.58%, based on data as of April 1, 2017. The company's Selling/Gen./Admin. expense, excluding anything labor-related, was 43% as a percentage of sales in 2016, suggesting heavy spending on sales and marketing. Although Gigamon's current marketing has worked to some extent, it's not most efficient to allow larger earnings.
 Sales grew from $97 million in 2012 to $311 million in 2016, an average growth rate of 44.1% over the five-year period. Its asset turnover ratio, a measure of a company's ability to generate sales from its assets, reached a high 91.3% in 2016 (calculated as sales over average total assets). This means without some meaningful increases in capital investments to scale up its business, further sales growth may be harder to come by. The question would then be if the company has the financial resources to take up the task. Capital expenditures are best met with operating cash flow, but Gigamon doesn't seem to have plenty of that, partly due to its relatively large cash outflow to sales and marketing spending. As for financing, the company has carried zero debt since at least 2012 and is not likely to just start borrowing for expansion. Even if it did, using the same sales and marketing technique would continue to constrict its margins. Running a business with prolonged low margins is certainly not how a company wants to deliver value to shareholders. Gigamon's business may have progressed to a point whereby outside capital support becomes a logical next step to help it stay in a healthy growth path, especially when the potential business combination can also address its currently less efficient sales structure. Gigamon's visibility platform, the company's underpinning product for the network visibility market, functions as a layer or link between the network infrastructure and the suite of security management and analytical tools by extracting data traffic within the network and delivering that to each security tool for performance evaluation. A network infrastructure without a traffic visibility product in place is hardly security integration-ready, while a security suite cannot augment its solutions and service without the aid of traffic visibility. Therefore, it's in the best interest of all parties in such an ecosystem - namely makers of network equipment, security software companies and network visibility vendors - to work in close partnership with each other. If traffic visibility products like Gigamon's are increasingly adopted by other parties in the ecosystem as part of their offerings, end users of network operators will be able to provide their customers with integrated, ready-to-implement network and security solutions from the very start.
 With Elliott Management recently taking an activist position in Gigamon, investors can expect changes to the company's current sales structure to take advantage of the unique market dynamic among network traffic visibility and monitoring, network infrastructure and security management. As of now, the company markets and sells its products through what it calls a hybrid sales model: it's a combination of direct sales to end users of network operators and indirect reselling through third-party channel distributors that requires Gigamon's technical training and support handled by its own overlay channel sales team, adding more to its marketing and sales cost. Gigamon's current marketing efforts focus on driving end-use demand and rely on channel distributors to generate more than half of its revenue. The company should have a lot of room for increasing the level of its work relationships with its ecosystem partners. It's likely that companies like Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) could have Gigamon's visibility platform directly integrated into their network equipment, effectively giving Gigamon a wholesaler with a far wider market reach than what the company itself could have. As for Cisco Systems, it also has a slew of cybersecurity products of its own, including its visibility offering Stealthwatch for monitoring traffic between branches that could benefit from the broader coverage of Gigamon's visibility products designed for deployment across a network. Giving Gigamon's leading visibility technology and the potential wider demand on this kind of security products, investors just need to have their finger on the pulse of any reorganization efforts of the company's marketing and sales structure, including a potential acquisition by an ecosystem partner. The essence of the company's business is to provide solutions for defending network security. This likely makes it a natural acquisition target, since to end users it's easier to have bundled sales of complete network infrastructure offerings that include both traffic visibility and security management as opposed to having different vendors each provide a piece of it.

Gigamon shares jump 12% on report that company is exploring sale
Shares of network monitoring software maker Gigamon Inc.  surged 12% Monday, after Reuters said the company is exploring a sale, citing people familiar with the matter. In May, activist shareholder Elliott Management Corp. said it had amassed a 15.3% stake in the company and said it would urge management to conduct a strategic review that included a possible sale. Gigamon has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser and is gearing up for talks with companies and private-equity investors, said Reuters. Gigamon, Goldman and Elliott declined to comment. Gigamon shares have fallen 3% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Foglamp Capital  is latest shareholder to urge Gigamon to conduct strategic review 
A day after hedge fund Elliott Management disclosed a 15.3% stake in networking hardware company Gigamon Inc. , another shareholder has come forward urging the company to conduct a strategic review of its operations. Foglamp Capital said it believes Gigamon is "significantly undervalued," and urged it to take measures to unlock value. Foglamp says it first bought shares in January, after the company said it would miss fourth-quarter guidance. "Foglamp has since built a significant position in the stock, and as of May 5, 2017, GIMO stock comprised 14.9% of Foglamp Fund, LP's unaudited NAV," it said in a statement. Foglamp said talks with customers in a wide range of sectors had convinced it that Gigamon has a strong reputation for its technology, which is deeply integrated into the network systems of big companies. But its existing structure is impeding shareholder returns. It urged the company to improve corporate governance and make other changes. Gigamon shares rose 1.2% premarket, but are down 9.6% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Gigamon shares jump 12% on report that company is exploring sale
Shares of network monitoring software maker Gigamon Inc.  surged 12% Monday, after Reuters said the company is exploring a sale, citing people familiar with the matter. In May, activist shareholder Elliott Management Corp. said it had amassed a 15.3% stake in the company and said it would urge management to conduct a strategic review that included a possible sale. Gigamon has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser and is gearing up for talks with companies and private-equity investors, said Reuters. Gigamon, Goldman and Elliott declined to comment. Gigamon shares have fallen 3% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Foglamp Capital  is latest shareholder to urge Gigamon to conduct strategic review 
A day after hedge fund Elliott Management disclosed a 15.3% stake in networking hardware company Gigamon Inc. , another shareholder has come forward urging the company to conduct a strategic review of its operations. Foglamp Capital said it believes Gigamon is "significantly undervalued," and urged it to take measures to unlock value. Foglamp says it first bought shares in January, after the company said it would miss fourth-quarter guidance. "Foglamp has since built a significant position in the stock, and as of May 5, 2017, GIMO stock comprised 14.9% of Foglamp Fund, LP's unaudited NAV," it said in a statement. Foglamp said talks with customers in a wide range of sectors had convinced it that Gigamon has a strong reputation for its technology, which is deeply integrated into the network systems of big companies. But its existing structure is impeding shareholder returns. It urged the company to improve corporate governance and make other changes. Gigamon shares rose 1.2% premarket, but are down 9.6% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Published on: March 7, 2017
Gigamon, Inc.: Class Action

By Fitapelli Kurta






 


 
 

Publicly available records indicate that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors in Gigamon, Inc. (NYSE: GIMO) in connection to alleged violations of securities laws by GIMO and certain of its officers. Fitapelli Kurta is interested in hearing from investors who have complaints regarding investments made in Gigamon between October 27, 2016 and January 17, 2017.
The lawsuit specifically alleges that Gigamon failed to disclose during the class period that it was undergoing a reduction of product bookings in its North America West region; that many of its customers were putting off purchasing decisions into the next year (2017); and that GIMO did not include information regarding these trends in financial guidance it released. The lawsuit alleges that after Gigamon announced, on January 27, 2017 that its fourth quarter revenue had been below previously released guidance due to product bookings that fell short of expectations, and due to deferred decisions, shares in GIMO fell substantially.
According to the company’s website, Gigamon is a network security infrastructure company that “provides active visibility into data-in-motion network traffic, enabling stronger security and superior performance.” The description continues: “Gigamon’s Visibility Fabric™ and GigaSECURE®, the industry’s first Security Delivery Platform, deliver advanced intelligence so that security, network, and application performance management solutions in enterprise, government, and service provider networks operate more efficiently and effectively.
A class action lawsuit has already been filed in connection with GIMO. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff in the Gigamon, Inc. lawsuit, you must move the Court no later than March 28, 2017.

GigaSMART


















            Manage your traffic with intelligence.
        


GigaSMART® extends the intelligence and value of the Gigamon Visibility Platform by enhancing the monitoring of your network infrastructure and improving security tool performance. A range of applications are available to optimize the traffic sent from your network to the tools you rely upon to monitor, manage, and secure the network. GigaSMART’s high-performance, advanced processing engine is available on GigaVUE® Visibility Appliances and can be accessed anywhere within the Gigamon Visibility Platform without port- or card-based restrictions.
























            Smart, efficient, effective traffic optimization
        


GigaSMART processing engines can be combined to manage higher traffic loads and optimized for specific applications. Applications can be combined or service chained so traffic benefits from multiple functions that can be achieved at once. Examples include generating NetFlow and other network metadata, decrypting SSL/TLS traffic after packet duplicates have been removed or stripping VLAN headers before load balancing the traffic and sending it out to the appropriate tools. GigaSMART applications can be applied to any network or tool port on the chassis or the entire cluster, allowing maximum flexibility in configuration and provisioning.

Adaptive Packet Filtering - Identifies and filters matching content based on signature or patterns across any part of the packet, including the payload.





























Application Session Filtering- Identifies and forwards traffic corresponding to application sessions to security appliances, increasing their efficacy and performance





























De-Duplication and Packet Slicing - Allows network monitoring tools to perform more efficiently by eliminating unwanted content





























ERSPAN Termination - Terminates ERSPAN tunnels to consolidate, filter, and forward relevant ERSPAN traffic





























FlowVUE - Flow-aware sampling of active subscriber devices can selectively reduce traffic bound to monitoring and analytic tools. Can turn Big Data into manageable data with deterministic results at a fraction of the data rate.





























GTP Correlation - Allows service providers to reliably filter and forward specified subscriber sessions (both GTP-c and GTP-u) to monitoring and analytic tools.





























SSL/TLS Decryption - Provides visibility into encrypted sessions, sending decrypted packets to both inline and out-of-band security tools





























Load Balancing - Allows distribution of traffic among multiple ports based on a variety of options: hashing, bandwidth, cumulative traffic, packet rate, connections, and round robin





























Masking - Allows network security teams to hide confidential information (passwords, financial accounts, or medical data), helping companies to comply with regulatory requirements password.





























NetFlow and Metadata Generation - Offloads this function to the Gigamon Visibility Platform, eliminating the risk of expending expensive production network resources in generating key analytics.





























Tunneling - Forwards packets from remote sites to centralized monitoring tools via IP/UDP or L2GRE encapsulation and integrates virtualized tools into the Visibility Platform via L2GRE tunnels





























Source Port Labeling and Time Stamping - Allow the addition of source or timing information at the point of collection, helping to improve traffic accuracy.

WHITE PAPERS
Tolly Network Packet Broker Test Report



Many organizations use Network Packet Brokers (NPBs) as a core element of their network visibility, placed between the network taps and the organization’s security and performance monitoring solutions. And while NPBs aggregate and filter data packets before feeding them to the security and monitoring tools to reduce total solution cost by improving tool efficiency, achieving 100 percent network visibility requires an NPB to process all data packets – without losing any. 
In this informative report, Tolly shows how Ixia’s Net Tool Optimizer (NTO) packet brokers processed 100% of packets at every speed, while running the most powerful features, delivering 100% visibility that our customers need to eliminate blind spots to achieve net higher performance.  According to the report, "By contrast, Gigamon demonstrated packet loss at every data size. At 256-bytes and below, the loss ranged from 20% to nearly 75%. With these loss levels, critical traffic needed for network analysis is almost guaranteed to be lost before reaching the network tool.”
What you’ll learn:

How you can obtain greater return on your IT investment by dramatically improving the effectiveness of your security and monitoring tools.
What role enhanced security can play by eliminating network blind spots that could be concealing an intrusion attempt, signs of abnormal bot traffic, or data exfiltration following a successful exploit;
An in-depth understanding of traffic volumes with complete data monitoring to help predict when systems may be about to fail enabling IT and security teams to gain control of their networks.

Don’t let the fear of blind spots stifle your ability to function at a higher level. Read the report now to learn more about how companies are using Ixia to do more stay protected.
