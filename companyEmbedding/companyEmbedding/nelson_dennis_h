Authors: James I. Brown, Vivian Vick Fishco, Gerald S. Hanna
Purpose: Assesses student achievement in vocabulary, comprehension, and reading rate
Restriction Level: Medium
Grades:	High school to four-year college
Times: Standard administration: 35 minutes; Extended-time administration: 56 minutes
Scores:	PR, SS, NCE, and stanine







Overview
The Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms G and H, is a reading survey test for high school and college students and adults. A two-part test, the Nelson-Denny measures vocabulary development, comprehension, and reading rate. Part I (Vocabulary) is a fifteen-minute timed test; Part II (Comprehension and Rate) is a twenty-minute test. The first minute of the Comprehension test is used to determine reading rate. Including the time needed to distribute materials, complete the name and information grids, and provide directions, the Nelson-Denny may be administered in forty-five minutes, or a single class period.
The Nelson-Denny Reading Test:

Aids in accurate placement of high school and college students at all reading levels
Provides comprehension passages drawn from widely used high school and college texts
Includes a vocabulary section that focuses on words students need for success in today's classrooms
Offers optional extended-time administration to meet the needs of special populations
Eliminates racial and gender bias
Includes national norms for high schools and two-and four-year colleges

A unique feature of the 1993 edition is the extended-time administration of the test to meet the needs of special populations, such as students with English as a second language or as a foreign language, or returning adults.
The 1993 edition of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms G and H, is the current edition of this widely used high school and college test. All test items and reading passages are exclusive to this edition and appear in a test format similar to that used in earlier editions. The basic test format was retained because of its wide acceptance by test users.
Other changes from previous editions include a reduction in the number of vocabulary items from 100 to 80 and inclusion of seven rather than eight reading comprehension passages, with a total of 38 rather than 36 items. These changes advance a trend in recent Nelson-Denny forms away from speediness and toward measurement of reading power.
Forms
Forms G and H are parallel forms that have been equated and can be used interchangeably as pretests and posttests. The equating study linking them is described in the Technical Report. An equating study of Form G and Form E links Forms G and H to the earlier Forms E and F. Thus, data for students previously tested with Form E or F can be related to data provided by Form G or H. Form G/Form E equating data and tables are provided in the Manual for Scoring and Interpretation.

                             Scoring
                         


The scores available for Vocabulary, Comprehension, and Total are raw scores, scale scores, grade-equivalent scores, normal curve equivalent scores, national percentile ranks, and national stanines. The reading rate is reported in words per minute. The scoring key and procedures for obtaining all scores are included in the Manual for Scoring and Interpretation.
Standardization and Norms
The national standardization and norming of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test was completed during the 1992-1993 school year. Norms are available for high school and two- and four-year colleges. Special norms are available for the extended-time administration and for law-enforcement academies. All norms conversion tables are included in the Manual for Scoring and Interpretation. Information about the standardization and other technical data are included in the Technical Report.
