He is the author of ‘Your Essential Anti Ageing Food and Fitness Plan’ – an easy to follow twelve week food and fitness transformation guide that comes complete with recipes, workouts and food & fitness videos.
He has a respected media profile with influential press working on leading women’s and men’s interest titles, social media and websites that include Woman & Home, Woman, Woman’s Own, Bella, British Mode, Vegetarian Living, Rude Health and Bodyfit.

This lead to him co formulating, with Nutritional Biochemist, Dr Robert Buist PhD, many cutting edge weight loss, life extension and beauty-from-within products including Ultra Renew, Anthoberry and Vitagest.
Rick’s clinical and management successes led to regular appearances on health shows on TVSN at home.  Well respected by his peers there he has wrote articles for numerous health publications and was a key health advisor on a health panel on a range of contemporary health issues.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Richard Burkey DPM237 W 10th StHays, KS 67601(785) 625-4940Physicians & Surgeons, PodiatristsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Patrick Richard & Tj2902 Skyline DrHays, KS 67601(785) 628-2011Nail SalonsBeauty SalonsMake an AppointmentAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Claiborn, Rick1905 General Custer RdHays, KS 67601(785) 628-3612InsuranceAgriculture InsuranceAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Sook Richard339 E 8th StHays, KS 67601(785) 628-2312InsuranceFinancial ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Kraemer Richard G3006 Broadway AveHays, KS 67601(785) 625-5605InsuranceWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection6. Rohr Richard722 E 7th StHays, KS 67601(785) 625-5977Plumbing Contractors-Commercial...WebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Abbott, Rick3701 Fairway DrHays, KS 67601(785) 621-4793Nurses-Advanced Practice-ARNPNursesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Richard P Loftus Dds;Pa2701 Sternberg DrHays, KS 67601(785) 625-7969Teeth Whitening Products & ServicesWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Rajewski Richard L2509 Canterbury DrHays, KS 67601(785) 623-5095Physicians & Surgeons, Family Medicine...WebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Rigmaiden, Richard S, MD2214 Canterbury DrHays, KS 67601(785) 625-4699Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Clausing Jr, Richard B2220 Canterbury DrHays, KS 67601(785) 623-5602Physician AssistantsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection12. Richard Shubert Farm2222 Emmeram RdHays, KS 67601(785) 623-4406FarmsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection13. Staples Richard E1507 Henry DrHays, KS 67601(785) 628-3763No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your shopping collection!Error when adding to shopping collectionThis business was removed from the shopping collection14. Rick's Food Store1104 3rd StVictoria, KS 67671(785) 735-2929Grocery StoresWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your shopping collection!Error when adding to shopping collectionThis business was removed from the shopping collection15. Rick's Food Store518 Main StLa Crosse, KS 67548(785) 222-2736Grocery StoresGeneral MerchandiseWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection16. Rick's Pipeline Inc469 S Van Houten StRussell, KS 67665(785) 483-3547Pipe Line CompaniesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your shopping collection!Error when adding to shopping collectionThis business was removed from the shopping collection17. Rick's Food Store518 Main StBison, KS 67520(785) 222-2736Grocery StoresWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your shopping collection!Error when adding to shopping collectionThis business was removed from the shopping collection18. Rick's Food Store518 Columbia StLa Crosse, KS 67548(785) 222-2736Grocery StoresAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection19. Deges Richard Ins AgencyGrainfield, KS 67737(785) 673-3141InsuranceSponsored LinksShowing1-19

Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At Claiborn, Rick, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the Hays, KS area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (Hays, KS); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 785-628-3612, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.
