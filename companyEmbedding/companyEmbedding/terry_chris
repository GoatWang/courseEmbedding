We are a stocking distributor of sewer, water, and road building materials, with a primary focus in the sewer and water utility industries. The company's origin dates back to the early 1920's, hence it's name reference to the clay product being the prevalent sewer pipe utilized in that era.Central Clay's current ownership took control in 1970, at which time Jack and Kay Cavanaugh purchased the business from the previous owners. Jack held the position of President and Treasurer, and directed the daily operations of the business, while Kay acted as Secretary, who's primary responsibility consisted of raising their eight children. Their four sons, John, Kevin, Terry, and Chris, along with their daughter Anne, joined the company during that time and held various sales and customer service positions. After a forty-one year career at Central Clay, Jack passed away in 1986, at which time Kay assumed the position of President and appointed her son John as Vice President and Treasurer. Kay recently retired from Central Clay, at which time she appointed John as President, who in turn appointed his brothers Kevin, Chris, and Terry as Vice Presidents.Central Clay Products, Inc. represents and stocks materials from the leading manufacturers in the utility industries including Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc., Contech Construction Products, Inc., Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe, J-M Manufacturing, Inc., Syracuse Castings Sales Corporation, and Clow Valve Company.

Product Description
Christopher Terry – Training Video

 
Christopher Terry currently lives in Westport with his wife Donna, their children Mariah and Brandon and their corgis, Max and Maggie. When Chris isn’t helping home buyers and sellers he’s spending time with them, enjoying the many lifestyle features and benefits living in Westport and Southern New England offers.
Chris believes that the South Coast and the Greater Fall River area has the greatest real estate upside potential for the New England area. “Our location makes for an easy commute to Boston, Providence, Newport and Cape Cod. Plus, we still have affordable housing, large areas of developable land, ample water supplies and low taxes.”
Chris was born in the U.S. Navy Hospital in Key West Florida, but didn’t stay long as his parents were both in the Navy and they moved often. They settled in Portsmouth, Rhode Island in 1968 where his parents still live in the same home Chris was raised in. He graduated Portsmouth High School in 1983 and attended The University of Rhode Island. Chris’s career in real estate started in 1992 when it was suggested he utilize his people and sales skills to help facilitate real estate transactions. Since then Chris has completed more than 70 million dollars in transactions, has traveled the country completing sales training through North America’s leading industry sales trainers and professionals, holds a real estate broker license in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island, is a Certified Distressed Property Expert (CDPE), a member of the Loss Mitigation Network, is a Master Sales Society Member, a 4-time winner of the Master Sales Society 5/50 Award and 10/100 Award, a WPI International Presidential Award winner, a founding member of the Massachusetts Millennium Mentor Group, founded the Pathway to Success Agent Training Program and Team EZ REO & Short Sales.
Chris founded E Z Home Search Real Estate on a set of core values to guide the philosophy and direction of the firm. These values are:
To Always: Live by the “Get by Giving” Philosophy;
To Always: Make our Clients #1 Goal, Our #1 Goal;

Tracks:


1.The Hymn
2.The Silly Samba

6.Lemon Drop

9.Somewhere Over the Rainbow



Product Description:


This is part of TCB's Swiss Radio Days Jazz Series.Personnel: Chris Woods (alto saxophone); Clark Terry (flugelhorn); Horace Parlan (piano); Victor Sproles (bass guitar); Bobby Durham (drums).Released for the first time on a 1997 CD, this concert performance from Switzerland finds flugelhornist Clark Terry in prime form. Heading a quintet that includes altoist Chris Woods (who also plays a little flute), pianist Horace Parlan, bassist Victor Sproles and drummer Bobby Durham, C.T. sounds quite exuberant on such numbers as "The Hymn," "Straight No Chaser" and "On the Trail." Terry and Woods' wild scatting (including a hilarious trade-off) on "Lemon Drop" is most memorable. Everything works during this superb concert, which also includes a Terry vocal on "I Want a Little Girl," a boppish rearrangement of "Over the Rainbow" and lots of strong soloing from C.T., Woods and Parlan. Highly recommended. ~ Scott Yanow

After reading my review article, you will have a better understanding of the company, the business model, and how to build a successful business if you decide to get started/join as an IBO. 
Continue reading below… I hope you enjoy my iMarketsLive review!
iMarketsLive Review | What Is iMarketslive?
International Markets Live (known as iMarketsLive), is run by professional trader & CEO Christopher Terry.
CEO iMarketsLive
After years of struggling in the financial markets, a group of traders come together with a group of marketers to create what is a perfect marriage for people who are looking for a way to create real wealth in their lives. 
iMarketsLive combines leverage of a team and the compounding effect of good trading of the financial markets. We created a two step system which is designed to help you make money and create time freedom.
Combining the power of the Internet with the time-tested strength of word-of-mouth marketing, we have a platform that is focused on helping our newest member get results.

CEO Christopher Terry describes the company as:
“The idea of iMarketsLive came about after I saw how many people were out there struggling in their day-to-day lives. I’ve been blessed to be given the opportunity to create real wealth in my life, and I know there is a better way.  So I created a system where anyone can see what we do on a day to day basis. I noticed most people did not have the time to sit all day to see what we do as traders. That’s when I created the IML Trade Signal Service and the Live Trading Room to help people become successful in the markets.”
After doing more research and reading more publications regarding CEO Christopher Terry, I believe that iMarketsLive is a reputable company, and Chris is not a forex scam artist but a true professional in the foreign exchange market.
iMarketslive Products & Services
There are many different products & services you will have access to if you decide to join iMarketsLive. Watch the video below to learn more about the products and services that iMarketsLive offers:
iMarketsLive Trading Room:
 The ‘Live Trading & Education Room’ is hosted daily (Monday through Friday 8:30 AM to 12 PM EDT.) with our expert traders to see exactly what they are doing each day to win in the markets; what they watch for when trading and areas that provide the best trading opportunities in the financial markets. This is where the real money is made in the markets. Every day the “Trading Room” provides you a unique opportunity to dive inside the mind of a trader, to learn what sets the successful opportunities from the lease profitable.iMarketsLive – Live Trading & Education Rooms
iMarketsLive Compensation Plan
With nothing but affiliate membership to sell within the opportunity, the iMarketsLive compensation plan revolves around the sale of iMarketsLive affiliate membership.
The iMarketsLive compensation plan gives an IBO 8 different ways to earn income (not including the opportunity to earn money by trading in the forex market)
Recruitment Commissions
iMarketsLive offer a Fast Start Bonus commission whenever a new affiliate is recruited into the company. The iMarketsLive Fast Start Bonus is paid out as a percentage of a newly recruited affiliate’s membership fee, and is paid down 4 levels of recruitment:

Level 1 (personally recruited affiliates) – 30%
Level 2 – 10%
Levels 3 and 4 – 5%

Residual Commissions
iMarketsLive residual commissions
Residual Commissions in iMarketsLive are paid out using a 3×8 matrix. A 3×8 matrix places an affiliate at the top of the matrix with three positions directly under them (level 1).
In turn, these level 1 positions branch out into another three positions each (level 2) and so on and so forth down 8 levels for a total of 9840 positions.
Within this 3×8 matrix, each position represents a recruited affiliate. Affiliates are recruited into a matrix either via direct recruitment or the recruiting efforts of an affiliates up and downlines.
For each position filled in an iMarketsLive matrix, the company pays out 8% of that affiliates monthly membership fees out as a commission.
An iMarketsLive affiliate membership is $247 a month, so this equates to $19.76 commission per position filled in an affiliate’s matrix.
Note that an affiliate is not able to earn on all eight levels of their matrix unless they recruit new iMarketsLive affiliates:

recruit 2 affiliates – earn on levels 1 to 4 of the matrix
recruit 6 affiliates – earn on levels 5 and 6 of the matrix
recruit 9 affiliates – earn on level 7 of the matrix
recruit 12 affiliates – earn on all 8 levels of the matrix

IML – iMarketsLive IBO Ranks

iMarketslive Review | #1 Problem Facing iMarketsLive IBO’s
I mainly created this iMarketsLive review for individuals checking into the company because of their interest in wanting to join the business and promote it as an affiliate/IBO.
The HONEST truth is, that the majority of iMarketsLive will NEVER see the success they were hoping or expected to receive and will fail in building their business. The reason for that is because they don’t know how to build a REAL long term and profitable mlm / network marketing business. This also leads to people failing in the business calling it a iMarketsLive scam or that it’s a iMarketsLive pyramid scheme (Which is not true)!
The #1 Problem facing ALL iMarketsLive IBO’s is their lack of knowledge for knowing how to generate new leads and prospects for the business. Just like any real business in today’s world, you need fresh target leads and interested prospects every single day.
Without these hot leads or prospects you can’t make any money, and without money you can’t build a successful and profitable business. PERIOD!
To learn how YOU can get MORE leads, sign up MORE IBO’s, and make MORE money in your iMarketsLive business…
