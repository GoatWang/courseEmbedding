VIDEO: Hoby Darling on Skullcandy’s Innovative Audio Strategy

At CES 2013, Frank Radice spoke to Hoby Darling, President & CEO of Skullcandy, for Red Touch Media‘s interview series, The Future of Content, During the interview they discussed Skullcandy’s Crusher headphones and the company’s audio innovation efforts.
Are you a Skullcandy owner? What innovations in audio do you think we’ll see being hyped at CES next year? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Frank Radice: Hi this is Frank Radice and I’m here with Hoby Darling, the head of SkullCandy. We’re continuing the series on the future of content. Hoby tell me a bit about SkullCandy, what you guys are up to and some of your new products.
Hoby Darling: Absolutely, good question, so number one when we think about SkullCandy it’s always how do we bring innovative audio that’s fun and young and irreverent to our 20 year old consumer and from an innovation perspective probably the biggest thing we have going on right now is around these headphones that I have right now, which are our Crusher platform headphones. And really what we did, is we went out and we said hey 20 year old what is it when you think about how you’ve ever experienced music, when did you love it most? And pretty much what we always hear as you can guess is, man it was when I sat in that front row of that concert, that first concert I remember it. And so what we did with crusher is we went let’s go and figure out how do we recreate that. So instead of just being a studio environment let’s make it feel like you’re in that front row of that concert. It’s gritty, it’s dirty, you can feel the vibration of the speakers rattling. So that’s what Crusher is all about.
Frank: So in terms of the RND, tell me a little bit about how you determined whether or not you wanted to have a product that tended to be on the bass side or a product that tended to be on the treble side, how did you figure out that sort of para-dime of sound was?
Hoby: Sure, I think overall when we think about sound we have what we call supreme sound so we really want to have a very smooth sound, you now, supreme sound across bass, mids and highs but for this product it was more how can we bring a full experience around what you’d feel at a concert and what you feel at a concert is those bass sound waves. And so, you know, this one isn’t necessarily tuned more bass it the haptic technology in it that makes your heart just boom boom boom boom like you’re in that front row.
Frank: Are these active or passive earphones? is there also some noise suppression or cancellation activity going on with them? Or is there some kind of a mixture of ambient sounds?
Hoby: Yeah, I mean you’ll have passive on it because of the way we develop the ear cup on it. So, you know it’s a full immersion experience but really concentrating on that really sound bass feel that comes out of it, that makes your teeth rattle.
Frank: So, you know, your products are literally everywhere. I mean, you can’t go into almost a drug store or a high end audio facility and as a matter of fact one of the people from Red Touch Media who works with us in South Africa said the product is everywhere, it’s ubiquitous. It’s also at a price point that anyone can afford. How did you decide that that was the business model that you wanted to have? And talk a little bit about your international success.
Hoby: Yeah, so international, on that, I mean we look at the business, we go we want international to be 50% of our business and I think for us bringing that american heritage piece to it around action sports, around music but doing it at a price point that’s accessible, you know, that’s a big piece internationally when you look at the South Africa’s as you brought up, or Latin America’s, Greater China but for us I think something that is special and you do strive for is how can we create amazing experiences and innovations but get them out to people, you know, so many companies create these amazing experiences but they’re priced so high that people don’t get to have them and we want to be able to take that fun, take that irreverence and take that out to a lot of people so they can enjoy it.
Frank: Thank you very much. That’s Hoby Darling, he is the head of SkullCandy. This is Frank Radice for Red Touch Medias continuing series on the future of content. See you next time.

Hoby Darling: Amplifying What Skullcandy Does Best

Josh McFadden
July  9, 2013







 

	Headquartered in Park City, Skullcandy has emerged as a global leader in performance audio and gaming headphones. The company markets and sells its products and accessories throughout the United States and, impressively, in more than 70 countries throughout the world. And now it has a new man in charge.

	Hoby Darling was recently named Skullcandy’s president and CEO, immediately assuming leadership of the growing public company. Darling comes to Skullcandy from athletic apparel giant Nike, where he was general manager of Nike+ Digital Sport. At Nike, he also filled the role of head of strategy and planning for Nike affiliates Converse, Cole Haan, Hurley and Umbro.

	With this impressive résumé to his credit, Darling is thrilled about his new duties at Skullcandy.

	“I was attracted to the company because of the significant market opportunity that I believe exists for Skullcandy, both within the headphone category as well as adjacent consumer electronic categories,” he says. “Skullcandy has tremendous brand recognition and a large and loyal consumer base. The pieces are in place to succeed.”

	As incoming CEO, Darling says he is confronting many challenges to growth. Having the right styles and innovations surrounding the products is key, as is maximizing customers’ in-store experience. These, along with driving people to Skullcandy’s best retail partners, need improvements, he says. However, Darling also sees an abundance of opportunities at Skullcandy.

	“I firmly believe that the headphone and overall audio category is on the verge of a multi-year product innovation cycle,” he says. “This will be fueled by advancements in consumer-relevant audio and communication technology that will change the way everyone listens to music and communicates with fans and family, from the hard-core audiophile to the casual listener. I believe the companies that focus on innovation and deep emotional connections with consumers through clear messaging and brand identity will be best positioned to capitalize on the coming changes.”

	Always mindful of his end-user, Darling says he “obsesses around the consumer in all aspects of the business.” And though he is passionate about what he does and is driven to succeed, Darling does not endorse a mindset of working oneself into exhaustion. Rather, his credo is to “work smarter, not harder.

	“My business philosophy is to edit and amplify,” he says. “Edit out areas of your business where you aren’t strongest and amplify what you do best. Do less, and do it bigger and better.”

	Throughout his career, Darling has been surrounded by some of the most gifted business, brand and product minds in the consumer world. Through his vast experience, he has fostered an understanding of distribution, marketplace and proven long-term model strategies. After all he has accomplished, Darling’s formula for success is simple.

	“Build a great team and empower them to change the world,” he says. “Be bigger than yourself. Have goals that are bigger than just creating a product. Have fun.”

	And as a leader in a rapidly evolving, exciting industry, Darling loves when people create and when they exceed even their own expectations. “It’s satisfying to watch people do things they never thought possible,” he says. “I love helping people get excited.”

Skullcandy CEO Hoby Darling’s risky business tips

February 27, 2014
Articles

Business student Lauren Vandertoolen attended the Career Conference held Saturday at the David Eccles School of Business, featuring a keynote address by Skullcandy CEO Hoby Darling, breakout sessions and networking opportunities with area professionals. Here’s her report from the scene: 
The David Eccles School of Business hosted a Career Conference Saturday for students in all majors other than finance and accounting. The morning was filled with break-out sessions, LinkedIn photographs, and networking, while lunch preceded keynote speaker Hoby Darling, CEO of Skullcandy, and final additional networking with potential employers. I was able to attend Darling’s presentation, and came away feeling both inspired and excited.
What makes Hoby Darling so successful, yet relatable? I will tell you. Besides his relaxed disposition, Darling’s work experience allows people to relate to him and realize that anything is possible if you work hard enough. Darling came from a small town in Washington where, at age 8, he sold concessions at a tennis club. The experience as an employee at such a young age taught him something he would carry on throughout his entire life–the importance of taking risks. Darling emphasized that you can come from anywhere, you just have to be willing to take a risk.
Darling then went to college, graduating with a degree in history. That led him to law school at Northwestern, where he graduated in the top 10% of his class. After spending some of his career in law, Darling learned his next lesson–you have to be passionate about what you do. “Put yourself in a position where you’re surrounded by people who want you to succeed,” he noted. Darling soon found out that he was less than passionate about pursuing a lifestyle as a lawyer. After practicing for more than 5 years, he knew it was time for a change and quickly was given a corporate position at Volcom.
While at Volcom Darling learned that competitors get better every single day, and the importance of keeping up with those competitors. In order to keep up, you have to continuously improve. To improve himself, he pursued an MBA at Cal-Berkeley.
After some time at Volcom, Darling’s career path propelled him to Nike, where he learned how to truly be consumer-obsessed. He talked about the importance of knowing exactly what excites a customer and knowing just who it is you’re talking to. You have to get close to your consumer and know what they do, drive, wear, etc.
While working his dream job at Nike, Darling was presented with an offer to be the next CEO of Skullcandy. Hesitant at first, Darling went into the job focused that the company would run his way, meaning consumer-obsession was key. He had no desire to optimize the company, but rather in putting the consumer first. As a result, Skullcandy’s stock price has seen a 75% increase in the time since he initially stepped in as CEO.
Darling closed his presentation with some key take away points for students to remember:


Take a Risk–Be innovative and challenge yourself


Get Gritty–hard work, persistence, and resilience will always pay off


Be Passionate–make work a calling


Better Today than Yesterday–always improve (your competition always will be)


People Matter–work in teams, build relationships and care


Consumer First–the consumer always decides your product


At the conclusion of his talk, I was able to talk to a few students about their favorite takeaways from the entire conference. BLInc member Scott Thatcher stated that the breakout sessions were his favorite part, saying “The small crowds made the environment easy to learn in, I was able to network, and learn how to get a job.” Hilal Mohamed had similar thoughts, stating that the breakout sessions were also rewarding. “Take risks and ride the biggest wave, look for those new and upcoming companies” was the biggest piece of advice he took away from the conference.
