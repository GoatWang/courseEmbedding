Youthful: 43-year-old Kelly calls her beauty regime 'minimalist' and is a huge advocate of Botox, happily chatting about her love for the injections to Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen 






Great shape: The petite TV star looked chic in the dress which showed off her super toned arms and legs 






All smiles: Kelly was happy to pose in her chic frock as she left the studios after her interview
 The star has previously been up front about her habits when it comes to maintaining her youthful looks. She told Elle magazine in February 2013 that not only does she get the injections in her eyes every seven months but she also injects her armpits to avoid sweating.Later in the show, Andy's guests also got a surprise phone call from Cher. Although the legendary diva disguised her voice, Anderson guessed right away that it was the star and the pair could hardly contain their excitement.Kelly's 
frock featured a racer back top in shades of pink with bursts of green 
floral motifs and fit snug around her tiny waist before flaring into a 
purple-hued miniskirt.She
 carried a black satin clutch which matched the sheen of her dress and 
donned a pair of white heeled pumps to add some height to her 5ft 3in 
frame. 






Banter: The trio appeared to have a blast on-set talking about beauty, reality stars and Cher
  






Photo op: Kelly shared a selfie with Anderson Cooper on the set of the show on Tuesday 






Adorable: The star gave her husband Mark Consuelos a big kiss on the cheek when they reunited after filming 






Too cute: Kelly gazes lovingly at her hubby as he grins widely for the cameras
 
 Her blonde shoulder-length locks were styled into a straight and chic bob. The
 petite beauty was also still looking very bronzed from her holiday in 
Greece last month with husband Mark Consuelos and friends Jessica and 
Jerry Seinfeld. She updated fans regularly on her activities as she island hopped on her Mediterranean getaway. 






Early bird: Kelly can be seen on weekday mornings hosting Live With Kelly And Michael. Seen here on Wednesday morning with guests Zach Braff and Anderson Cooper
 Along with happy snaps with her famous 
pals, the star posted a number of shots of husband Mark and their three 
gorgeous children - Michael, 17, Lola, 13, and 11-year-old Joaquin.The photos were mostly 
taken in Santorini, while it also appeared that they did some 
sightseeing in Sounion as they paid a visit to the Temple Of Poseidon.Watch
 What Happens Live is on Sunday to Thursday evenings on Bravo and Kelly can 
be seen co-hosting alongside Michael Strahan on ABC's Live With Kelly And Michael 
on weekday mornings.
