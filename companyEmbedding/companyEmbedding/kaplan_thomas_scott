Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

beneficial ownership resulting from, the readjustment of the terms of certain   
loans and warrants and (ii) to report an acquisition of shares by an entity     
controlled at the time by Mrs. Kaplan which had been erroneously omitted from   
the Kaplans' Schedule 13D, as amended. All capitalized terms used but not       
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the  
Schedule 13D, as amended to date.                                               

Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

On October 10, 2002, LCM acquired 370,000 shares of Common Stock from the       
Company for an aggregate purchase price of $37,000. The source of the funds used
by LCM was working capital.                                                     

Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer                                    

Items 5(a) and 5(b) are hereby amended and restated to read as follows:         

  (a)   As of February 12, 2004, Mr. Kaplan beneficially owns 14,567,854
shares of Common Stock, comprised of:                   

           (i)   An aggregate of 12,219,751 shares held by Electrum consisting
              of (1) 4,307,488 shares of Common Stock held outright; (2)
              6,279,761 shares underlying Common Stock purchase warrants
            which are excercisable at an exercise price of $0.40 per
              share, (3) 670,000 shares underlying Common Stock purchase
                warrants which are exercisable at an exercise price of $1.50
                 per share, and (4) 481,251 shares of Common Stock and 481,251
          shares underlying warrants which are exercisable at an
                exercise price of $1.50 per share, which shares and warrants
                are issuable to Electrum upon conversion of convertible debt
                 held by Electrum. As sole voting trustee pursuant to a voting
          trust agreement with Electrum, Mr. Kaplan is deemed to
             beneficially own the foregoing securities for purposes of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act;          

P-->SC 13D/A5th�Page�of�8TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
          (ii)  1,000,000 shares of Common Stock held by Tigris. As the sole
               stockholder of Tigris, Mr. Kaplan is deemed to beneficially
                 own such shares for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act;                                        

            (iii) An aggregate of 1,348,103 shares held by LCM consisting of (1)
             900,174 shares of Common Stock held outright; (2) 113,413
           shares of Common Stock underlying Common Stock purchase
                warrants which are exercisable at an exercise price of $1.50
            per share; and (3) 167,258 shares of Common Stock and an
               additional 167,258 shares of Common Stock underlying Common
                Stock purchase warrants which are exercisable at an exercise
           price of $1.50 per share, which shares and warrants are
               issuable to LCM upon conversion of convertible debt held by
          LCM. As sole voting trustee pursuant to a voting trust
                agreement with LCM, Mr. Kaplan is deemed to beneficially own
                 the foregoing securities for purposes of Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act.                               

      Based upon 33,229,085 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of
          January 14, 2004, as reported in the Company's Form 10-KSB for the
      fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, the foregoing shares of
           Common Stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Mr.
        Kaplan , in the aggregate, constitute approximately 35.0% of the
      shares of Common Stock outstanding (assuming conversion of all
           warrants, convertible debt and warrants underlying convertible debt
beneficially owned by Mr. Kaplan).                      

        From and after August 27, 2003, Mrs. Kaplan beneficially owns no
shares of Common Stock.                                 

   (b)   Mr. Kaplan has the sole power to vote or direct the vote and sole
            power to dispose of the shares that are held by Tigris, Electrum and
           LCM, except that, until August 27, 2003, Mrs. Kaplan held such sole
power with respect to the shares held by LCM.           

Item 5(c) is hereby amended as follows:                                         

(c)   Set forth below are all transactions of the Reporting Persons 
    reportable under Section 5(c) of Schedule 13D not previously
          reported in the Schedule 13D. All transactions reported below were
            effected by the Reporting Persons through LCM. All such transactions
were with the Company.                                  

            On October 10, 2002, LCM acquired 370,000 shares of Common Stock for
an aggregate purchase price of $37,000.                 

     On February 12, 2004, pursuant to an Amended Loan and Warrant
         Agreement with the Company, LCM and Electrum agreed to adjust the
          conversion terms of the convertible debt and certain warrants held
           by LCM and Electrum. LCM and Electrum also agreed to waive past due
            interest payments on the notes totaling approximately $130,000 as of
           10/31/03. The convertible debt, previously convertible at $0.50 per
  unit, will now be convertible at $1.25 per unit, each unit
        consisting of one share and one warrant exercisable at $1.50. In
         addition, the exercise price of all warrants issued in connection
          with the convertible debt was increased to $1.50 per share and the
          expiration dates of all warrants issued before January 30, 2002 in
           connection with convertible debt were accelerated by one year. Also
     on such date, Trend elected to repay $68,435.36 due under the
      convertible debt held by Electrum and $23,784.67 due under the
convertible debt held by LCM.                           

Item 5(d) is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:                    

     (d)   The Trust has the right to receive dividends from, and the proceeds
   from the sale of the shares of Common Stock held by LCM and
 Electrum. Until August 27, 2003, Mrs. Kaplan, as the sole
           shareholder of Electrum and LCM, had the right to receive dividends
from, and the proceeds from the sale of all such shares.

Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to
Securities of the Issuer                                        

Paragraph 15 of Item 6 is hereby supplemented and amended as follows:           

(15) On February 12, 2004, pursuant to an Amended Loan and Warrant  
Agreement with the Company, LCM and Electrum agreed to adjust the   
     conversion terms of the convertible debt and certain warrants held by LCM
 and Electrum. The shareholders also agreed to waive past due interest
     payments on the notes totaling approximately $130,000 as of 10/31/03. The
   convertible debt, previously convertible at $0.50 per unit, will now be
    convertible at $1.25 per unit, each unit consisting of one share and one
warrant exercisable at $1.50. In addition, the exercise price of all
    warrants issued in connection with the convertible debt was increased to
  $1.50 per share and the expiration dates of all warrants issued before
    January 30, 2002 in connection with convertible debt were accelerated by
     one year. Also on such date, Trend elected to repay $68,435 due under the
   convertible debt held by Electrum and $23,785 due under the convertible
debt held by LCM.                                                   

The following paragraph is hereby added at the end of Item 6:                   

      (16) On February 12, 2004, Mr. Kaplan and the Company reached a settlement
for the disgorgement of $210,194 of short-swing profits, the maximum
      amount that might be recoverable by the Company under Section 16(b) of the
     Exchange Act as a result of deemed acquisitions of shares of Common Stock
    underlying convertible debt by LCM and Electrum that occurred within six
months of dispositions of shares and warrants by LCM and Electrum.

           (i)   An aggregate of 18,443,693 shares held by Electrum consisting
              of (1) 5,765,742 shares of Common Stock held outright; (2)
              6,949,761 shares underlying Common Stock purchase warrants

   (b)   Mr. Kaplan has the sole power to vote or direct the vote and sole
            power to dispose of the shares that are held by Tigris, Electrum and

         price and expiration date of all warrants held by the lenders was
         reduced to $0.25 and the expiration date of all such warrants was
       extended by five years. In addition, the Company granted to the
          lenders a 90 day option to convert interest payable as of June 30,
2006 into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in New York City, Kaplan was raised in a Jewish family[2] in Florida, the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.
In his youth, he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for Rembrandt, which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found leading felid conservation group Panthera,[3] and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the Dutch Golden Age.[4] At Oxford University, Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.[5] He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.[6] While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies publicly traded in the US.[6] On a business trip, he met his future wife, Daphne Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.[6] Daphne's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place.[6] When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.[6]
Career[edit]
Inspired by Marc Faber, who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.[6] In 1993, he founded Apex Silver Mines to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.[7] While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.[8][9] Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.[6]
In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.[10]
Also in 2003, Kaplan founded Leor Exploration & Production LLC,[11] which became the fastest-growing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s natural gas assets were sold to EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. for $2.55 billion.[12][13]
Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.[14][15] and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,[16] two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.[17][18] Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation, which owns the Sunshine silver mine in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,[19] as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.[20]
His view on gold has not changed.[21] On February 25, 2009, he commented in Marc Faber’s Gloom, Boom & Doom Report: “Some will say that $800 gold seems expensive. I would suggest the contrary: that a few years from now, sub-$1000 gold will feel like a true gift... The forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late 2008 and early 2009 has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… [It] should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies, including a strong dollar, and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world.”[22]
In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan discussed the Prudent Man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the Prudent Man rule may well be golden indeed.”[23]
As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led Bloomberg Businessweek to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."[6] In a May 2010 profile piece in the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan said, “I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” adding, “You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution. If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”[24]
Kaplan's robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a December 2010 Wall Street Journal article, which described Kaplan along with other investors including John Paulson, David Einhorn and John Burbank. The article stated that Kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor,” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets.”[25]
In a 2015 interview in the "Octavian Report," Kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold, stating, "As a secular trend, I see a great many similarities between the Dow in the 1980s and where we are today in gold. During the 1980s, if one bought the DJIA at 1,100, 1,200, or 1,300, it didn't have a material impact on long-term returns. At any of those levels it was a great buy. I feel the same for gold. If one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle, so much the better. But prices are headed much, much higher after this correction is over. I've been in this movie before."[26] Kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the January 2016 issue of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report entitled "The Tortoise and the Hare." "Having a second bite of the apple," he wrote, "is not reserved just for those who bought Apple. It can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than Apple itself: gold."[27]
Rembrandt and the Old Masters[edit]
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood: "I was touched by Rembrandt in a very deep way when I first encountered one of his paintings at the Metropolitan Museum [in New York], when I was six... When I was eight, and my parents asked me where I wanted to go on vacation I said, 'Amsterdam,' because that's where Rembrandt was from. I was floored by the beauty of the Old Masters, the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture."[4]
Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, rivaling the holdings of many major museums. Named after Rembrandt's native city, the Collection currently numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.[28][29] The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations. Kaplan explained, "In effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain, in many cases for the first time... We got a lot more pleasure sharing."[30]
The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".[31] At the core of the Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.[32]
A parallel focus of the Collection is the representation of other artists from Leiden, in particular the fijnschilders ("fine manner painters"), including Frans van Mieris and Gabriël Metsu, who flourished during mid-century under the influence of Rembrandt's first pupil, Gerrit Dou. The number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the Leiden Collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection. In addition, tracing the interrelationships between Amsterdam and Leiden, the Collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities, including Frans Hals from Haarlem, Gerard ter Borch from Deventer, Hendrick ter Brugghen from Utrecht, and the only remaining privately held work by Johannes Vermeer from Delft.[32]
The Kaplans aspire for the Collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research. The couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and "transcend cultural differences."[33] At the launch of their exhibition, "Masterpieces from the Leiden Collection – The Age of Rembrandt", which opened at the Louvre Museum in February 2017, Kaplan stated: "Our sense of mission is to use Old Masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring: tolerance and mutual respect... Art alone may not save the world, but it can help repair it."[34]
In expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for China and the Middle East, Kaplan explained that "rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges, (my wife and I) are using the most powerful tools we have, Rembrandt and our passion, to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart."[35]
The unveiling of the Leiden Collection, along with its high-profile exhibition at the Louvre Museum, received extensive international coverage including profiles in, among others, The New York Times,[30] Le Monde,[33] Le Figaro,[36] The Wall Street Journal,[28] The Economist,[35] and Handelsblatt.[37]
Philanthropy[edit]
Conservation[edit]
Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.[38][39] Conservationist Doug Tompkins has referred to Panthera as "the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world," with National Geographic saying Panthera "represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation."[40]
Panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the Americas.[41][42] In particular, the work of Panthera’s CEO, Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, and Kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in Brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a January 2011 profile by CBS's 60 Minutes.[43] In that piece, Kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment: "There is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say: 'Hey, wait a minute, our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar.' When you show that, you have won their hearts and their minds. Then you have won the war."[44] For his work as an environmentalist, Kaplan was the recipient of the "Hero of the Year Award" by the IWFF in 2012.[45]
Kaplan and his wife Daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at Oxford University in collaboration with Dr. David MacDonald. In 2009, the couple endowed the Recanati-Kaplan Center at Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, the WildCRU, and the university's Postgraduate Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice, which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at Oxford. In February 2012, Oxford's WildCRU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in recognition of WildCRU's outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation.[3][46]
In July 2015, a male lion named Cecil, one of those being studied by the WildCRU's Hwange Lion Research Project, was killed in Zimbabwe by a trophy hunter. The killing of Cecil led to a public outcry across the world. The Hwange project had been funded by the Kaplans directly and through Panthera's Project Leonardo. "For us, Cecil was like part of the family, so we don’t take this lightly," Kaplan said. "Cecil became a symbol while he was alive, but in death, he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species." The campaign to highlight the plight of African lions brought considerable attention to the WildCRU and Oxford, prompting Professor MacDonald to remark to Forbes Magazine, "I think it’s also obvious that Tom and his wife Daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history."[47]
The Kaplans also founded the Orianne Society, focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, the last remaining long-leaf pine forests of the Southeastern United States.[48] As part of this effort, the Kaplans created the Orianne Indigo Snake Preserve in Georgia through the purchase and donation of 2,500 acres of the snake’s winter habitat.[3] In recognition for their work in wildlife conservation, in 2014 the Kaplans were awarded the New Species Award, and the naming of the newly discovered Orianne's Tree Snake, by the African Rainforest Conservancy.[49]
Regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes, Kaplan said, "If you want psychic gratification, one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime."[3] Kaplan cites American media mogul and philanthropist Ted Turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species.[50]
On June 1, 2014, in what Kaplan described as "a turning point for global cat conservation,"[51] environmental philanthropists from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States formed an unprecedented new Global Alliance with Panthera, committing an initial $80 million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the world's wild cats and their ecosystems. Among the initial partners with the Kaplans was Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and whose personal commitment to the Panthera alliance is managed through the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, established in 2009. The Global Alliance's commitment provides cornerstone funding for Panthera's $200 million initiative for wild cats.[52][53]
Medical research[edit]
The Kaplans have funded the Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research.[54] In 2012, the Kaplans created the Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.[55]
Academia and public policy[edit]
Kaplan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[56] He also belongs to the International Council of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University,[57] where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American General David Petraeus created the Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program. Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of CIA, NSA, DIA—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."[58]
Community and culture[edit]
Kaplan is also active in community philanthropy. He served as president (2009-2012) and chairman of the board of directors (2012-2015) of the 92nd Street Y, a prominent Jewish community and cultural center in New York City. His wife Daphne and Robert Gilson conceived of the Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts, which funds scholarships based on artistic merit for children and teens to study with the 92Y's renowned School of the Arts.[59]
Spitfire restoration[edit]
In 2015, after the passing of his boyhood friend, Simon Marsh, Kaplan parted with the two Spitfire Mark I fighter planes that he and Marsh had as partners restored with Historic Flying of Duxford, Cambridgeshire.[60] The first of the planes, Spitfire N3200, was gifted in the presence of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, to the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, where it had last flown as the personal aircraft of the Commander of 19 Squadron, Geoffrey Dalton Stephenson, later personal pilot to King George VI.[61][62] The second, Spitfire P9347, flown by Captain Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk, was sold at auction at Christies London, where it achieved a record price for any spitfire at auction, the proceeds of which were donated for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Society, Panthera, Oxford's WildCRU and Stop Ivory.[60][63]
Distinctions[edit]
In March 2014, Kaplan was awarded the rank of Chevalier in the Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur of France, the country's highest civilian distinction. In presenting the decoration, the French Ambassador to the United States, François Delattre, said of Kaplan: "Through your multifaceted life and your support for an incredible array of causes, I believe you are the very definition of a game changer and Renaissance man - a young Renaissance man: as Chairman of the Y, as an environmentalist in Brazil, as an entrepreneur, a historian, a philanthropist, an art collector and a politically engaged individual."[64][65]
In March 2017, Kaplan was decorated as a Commandeur in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France's Minister of Culture, Audrey Azoulay, at a ceremony at the Louvre Museum. The award was given in recognition of the Kaplan family’s contribution to the arts in France as well as globally.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Thomas Kaplan is married to Daphne Recanati Kaplan, daughter of Israeli artist Mira Recanati and investor Leon Recanati. They have three children.[6][66]

Capital Gold Group Report: A Billionaire Goes All-In on Gold

By Liam Pleven and Carolyn Cui, May 22, 2010


 Michael Rubenstein for The Wall Street Journal
Tigris Financial’s Thomas Kaplan, in his New York office this past week, on his investment focus: ‘I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold.’



Gold is setting records again, boosting the holdings of central banks, Armageddon worrywarts, and ordinary people who own gold bars, coins and jewelry.
But few individuals stand to benefit as much as low-profile billionaire Thomas Kaplan. A New York-born commodities magnate who earned a doctorate in British colonial history at Oxford, Mr. Kaplan oversees an empire devoted largely to gold.
Many fund managers and high-rollers have allocated small percentages of their portfolios to gold as a hedge against inflation. But Mr. Kaplan is the bull of bullion. He has gone further than perhaps any other major investor, betting the majority of his wealth on gold and other precious metals. And it reflects his deeply held conviction that global economic instability could bring rising demand for gold.
Through his firm, Tigris Financial Group, and affiliates, Mr. Kaplan has loaded up on bullion and bought up properties in 17 countries on five continents, where geologists are exploring for more. Tigris subsidiaries have taken stakes in mining companies, including tiny firms that have yet to produce an ounce. 
Though he won’t disclose how much physical gold he owns, Mr. Kaplan, who is 47 years old, controls up to 30% of the shares in some so-called junior miners. Together, his holdings amount to a nearly $2 billion bet on gold, more than the Brazilian central bank’s bullion is currently worth.



“I’ve reached a point where I feel the only asset I have confidence in is gold,” Mr. Kaplan said in an interview at Tigris’s midtown Manhattan headquarters.
Mr. Kaplan’s views are shaped by a concern, shared by many investors, that heavy government spending hasn’t contained the woes facing the financial system. Gold hit an exchange record of $1,242.70 a troy ounce at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on May 12, days after euro-zone leaders announced a nearly $1 trillion bailout for ailing member states.
He has experience with how supply and demand can drive the price of raw materials. His doctoral thesis studied Britain’s involvement after World War II in Malaya, home to prized rubber and tin. That taught him how far people and governments will go to secure natural resources.
 Wanting to apply his insights, he went to Israel to advise hedge funds. His nose for finding valuable resources was developed at firms he started that explored for silver and natural gas, which helped him make his fortune.
On Demand and Supply
Gold miners are struggling to make major discoveries and it takes years to bring new finds into production. If people want to stock up on gold in a hurry, it will be hard to ramp up production enough to satisfy them, Mr. Kaplan believes. 
“You’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution,” he said. “If the world does well, gold will be fine. If the world doesn’t do well, gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse.”
Mr. Kaplan is known in the mining industry for his all-in approach. “When he likes something, he dives in with both feet,” Egizio Bianchini, a banker at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, said of Mr. Kaplan, whom he has worked with in the past.
In his charitable endeavors, Mr. Kaplan works similarly. In 2006, he co-founded Panthera Corp., whose “single-minded pursuit” is preserving the world’s endangered wild cats, he wrote in an open letter on the group’s site in which he cited inspirational quotes by Winston Churchill, Edward R. Murrow and Marcus Aurelius.
Mr. Kaplan is also president of the board of directors at New York’s 92nd Street Y, a prominent cultural organization that is a magnet for New York’s elite. And he is a benefactor of Eternal Jewish Family, a group dedicated to uniform rules governing conversions to Judaism whose leader resigned last year amid an alleged sex scandal.
In some cases, Mr. Kaplan has invested in gold miners that have also attracted the attention of fellow billionaires, such as George Soros and John Paulson.


 


Mr. Kaplan put money into one firm, Gabriel Resources Ltd., in late 2007 after Mr. Paulson, who made billions of dollars betting against housing markets, mentioned how low the stock had fallen while they attended “The Nutcracker” at the New York City Ballet.
“I’m there,” Mr. Kaplan recalls was his response. 
In early March, Mr. Paulson’s firm, Paulson & Co., and Quantum Partners, Ltd., an investment fund run by Soros Fund Management, invested $100 million and $75 million, respectively, in NovaGold Resources Inc., a Canadian miner, paying $5.50 a share. Their move came a year after Mr. Kaplan, who has $69 million invested in the company, acquired 30% of the firm for $1.30 a share.
Gold prices are up 7.4% this year, after rising 24% last year, which was the ninth straight up year for bullion. Mr. Kaplan thinks that greater gains are coming. “I wouldn’t even say we’re in a bull market yet,” he said.
But Mr. Kaplan has concentrated risk in a volatile sector, and he knows the potential pitfalls better than most. 
In 2008, for instance, a company that Mr. Kaplan founded, Apex Silver Mines Ltd., went bankrupt, felled by the terms of a loan made after Mr. Kaplan left the company in 2004. The company emerged from bankruptcy last year, and now operates as Golden Minerals Co.
In January 2009, Mr. Kaplan received a so-called Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to what the company said were “impermissible payments” of $125,000 to government officials by executives at a South American subsidiary.
The SEC delivers Wells notices to inform recipients that it may bring an enforcement action, providing an opportunity for the recipient to persuade the agency not to pursue charges. No charges have been filed against Mr. Kaplan. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.
Concentrated Risk
Mr. Kaplan’s current investments also carry risk. Gabriel Resources owns Europe’s biggest undeveloped gold deposit, in Romania, but has been waiting for government approval for years. He has $100 million at stake in the company.
Mr. Kaplan acknowledges the dangers involved in investing in small mining companies. “It’s not the kind of thing I would suggest for widows and orphans,” he said.
And, he added, he isn’t in a rush to cash in on his gold investments. “If I am right about the big picture,” he said, “I will be rewarded for my patience.”

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
