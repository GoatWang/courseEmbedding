The Hollywood Hawaii Media AllianceVP Strategic Marketing · 2012年1月 - 2014年 · 纽波特比奇The Hollywood Hawaii Media Alliance advocates for business-related growth of the Creative Industries. Currently, there is legislation before the Hawaii State Senate that will help promote film and digital media industry development throughout the Islands. The Alliance supports the spirit and intent of the passage of this job-creating legislation. This groundbreaking initiative will enable Hollywood and the World to produce quality creative industry jobs and will provide additional tax credits for Studios and Independents who bring projects to Hawaii.  Am a member of the Creative Team. We are producing a one-hour TV Special "Aloha Hollywood -- Celebrating 100 Years of Hollywood in Hawaii.” This Television Special will showcase some of the most recognized and celebrated performances by stars and directors who created TV programs and movies throughout the Hawaiian Islands between 1913 and 2013.   Senator Joe Tanaka, Governor Neil Abercrombie, The Governor's Chief-of-Staff and other top officials from the State of Hawaii are among the many dignitaries supporting our efforts to create this Centennial celebration.  The TV Special will lead viewers through many of the most famous moments that received Academy and Emmy Awards. Viewers will be captivated as our program leaves them breathless from watching the most recognized star performances of a lifetime, many of which precede radio, television and the Academy Awards.  I have opened negotiations with George Clooney and Helen Hunt to be the host of this TV Special.Aloha Hollywood2012年至今Showcasing The Most Memorable TV Shows and Films Produced in the Hawaiian Islands from 1913 - 2013  As Hawaii marks its centennial anniversary in 2013, The Hollywood Hawaii Media Alliance celebrates Hollywood’s best and brightest stars appearing in the most memorable films and television shows produced in the Hawaiian Islands. We propose a TV special highlighting the historical significance of Hawaii’s contribution to Hollywood’s TV and filmmaking industry. This hour-long TV special is a star-hosted clip show featuring behind the scenes stories, location shoots around the islands and footage from famous films and movies produced in Hawaii. The centerpiece of this show will be commemorating some of the most fascinating performances by stars and directors who created TV shows or films produced throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Viewers will travel from the early days of filmmaking to some of the most famous movie star moments that received Academy and Emmy Awards right up to the present moment highlighting hit TV show’s like Hawaii Five-O.  Viewers will want to see the magic of history being made in 2013 with this most-storied show…Celebrating 100 years Of Hollywood In Hawaii.  Hawaii is a place that captivates the viewers and this TV special will leave them breathless from watching the most recognized performances of a lifetime, many preceding radio, TV and the Academy Awards. Hawaii’s natural beauty is well known around the world and it’s sandy beaches, towering volcanoes and lush valleys lure of thousands of tourists each year. The Hawaiian Islands have captured the attention of Hollywood’s producers and directors for 100 years. Celebrating a fascinating first century of television shows and movies made in Hawaii reinforces Hawaii’s aloha spirit with eager audiences around the world.  Paying tribute to Hollywood’s love affair with Hawaii - we propose shooting a 1 Hour TV special spotlighting some of Hollywood’s biggest and brightest stars who have been featured in TV and films produced in Hawaii. For example, “Aloha from Hawaii” was an Elvis Presley concert broadcast live on January 14, 1973. It is still one of the most watched broadcasts by an individual entertainer in television history.  From the original Hawaii Five-O hit TV series starring Steve McGarrett to James Bond and George Clooney... some of Hollywood’s most recognized names have starred in productions made in Hawaii.  Adam Sandler, Owen Wilson, Tim Allen and Ben Stiller have made audiences laugh out loud at their antics in movies filmed in Hawaii.   Stars from Julie Andrews, Helen Hunt, Heather Locklear, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Bosworth, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz to Hollywood’s earlier generation such as Rita Hayworth, Jane Russell, Mitzi Gaynor, Shirley Temple, Donna Reed and Betty Grable have been in Hawaii made movies.  Local celebrities and aspiring young actresses like Gloria Gaynor and Vicki Cayetano (wife of Hawaii’s former Governor Ben Cayetano) have staked a claim in Hawaii’s entertainment history. The most famous movie stars going back to Hollywood’s golden days have left their infamous mark on Hawaii. Big screen idols have included: Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Natalie Wood, Robert Wagner, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis.  The first Hollywood produced films go as far back as 1913 and include, The Shark God (which was shot in about 1 hour and then immediately another entire movie, Hawaii Love was shot in about 45 minutes). Stories weaved about love, war, romance and beach parties with Elvis Presley have entertained hundreds of millions of movie audiences for 100 years now. Since those early days of film making, there have been some great award-winning movies made in the Hawaiian Islands like, “The Descendents” starring George Clooney. In 2012, “The Descendents” received five Oscar Nominations and two Golden Globe awards. Hawaii’s glowing appeal is recognized worldwide and it’s luminous allure and natural beauty is unsurpassed, making the Hawaiian Islands the ideal back lot for Hollywood to shoot TV and produce more blockbuster films here for the next 100 years to come.
