Empowering you with objective information to assess pulmonary nodules. 




Potentially avoiding biopsy or surgery – a reason to smile. 




Simultaneously measures multiple proteins associated with lung cancer. 







Xpresys Lung
Xpresys Lung is a molecular blood test developed to provide non-invasive, objective information for assessment of pulmonary nodules. When combined with current clinical assessment, Xpresys Lung may be able to help reduce unnecessary invasive procedures. By reducing these, our objectives are to improve patient outcomes, reduce complications, and lessen the cost to the healthcare system.

Indi Secures $6.1 Million in Financing and Major Medicare Coverage Milestone for Xpresys Lung Molecular Diagnostic For Ruling Out Lung Cancer




11/21/2016:
Integrated Diagnostics has completed the development of its second generation Xpresys Lung plasma proteomic molecular diagnostic.  The development was based on two prospective trials enrolling over 1000 lung nodule patients from over 45 sites.  The new test’s ability to rule out early stage cancer in lung nodules is very high in low to moderate risk patients with a 98% negative predictive value.

In order to prepare for the second generation Xpresys Lung test, commercial testing utilizing the first generation Xpresys Lung test has been halted. The Company anticipates offering the second generation Xpresys Lung after Medicare evaluation of the test and a successful coverage determination.

Company
Diagnostics Development: A New Approach
Indi is creating large-scale, blood-based molecular diagnostics that leverage advances in proteomics to better diagnose complex diseases. The company was co-founded by Dr. Lee Hood to develop diagnostics and measurement technologies capable of measuring hundreds of biomarkers simultaneously, for improved diagnosis and more accurate management of complex diseases like lung cancer.
A Systems Biology View
Diagnostics development at Indi is conceptually based on a systems biology view of disease – one where pathophysiology arises from disease-perturbed networks of proteins, genes and other molecules. By aiming to understand the whole system – and make sense out of a wealth of new proteomic information – we are creating diagnostics capable of measuring disease with greater precision.
Center of a Diagnostics Ecosystem
Indi is at the center of a unique network of scientists, partners and investors who share a vision for molecular diagnostics. Our work is based on intellectual property developed by our founders at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) and Caltech.
Indi’s investors include InterWest Partners and The Wellcome Trust.


“For years diagnostics development has meant investigating just a few biomarkers at a time. Now Indi has brought together the technology, data and people to create diagnostics that are two orders of magnitude larger – to gain a systems view of health and disease.”


Albert A. Luderer, Ph.D.
CEO, Indi
