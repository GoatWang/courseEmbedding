OGL’s main business is a combination of Agriculture in Vegetable production and
theme park entertainment. They grow their produce through a hydroponic system
which gives them the edge in their market as growing organic and healthy
vegetables. 

Currently the lands of China are dominated by traditional farmers and farming
methods. There are few hydroponic growers in China and only several near OGL’s
farm. Though there are the few farms that can offer produce similar to that of
OGL’s produce, none are at the scale at which OGL operates. OGL will be able to
offer their produce at a cost lower than competitors because of lower overhead
cost per output and be able to supply it to large retail chains consistently.
Not to mention the growing demand of consumers who want organic produce, even
with competitors the market is too huge to be covered by the current suppliers.

Within the theme park industry, OGL’s closest competitor would be China Wu
Culture Expo Park. They are a theme park that is largely based on cultural
experience for the tourist. In terms of competition they are really only a
competitor if the tourists don’t actually know which theme park to go to. OGL’s
theme park is based on the whole agriculture experience. It tries to teach and
incorporate tourist into the farm by providing them with educational activities,
doing the actual picking of the vegetables, tour the wide scale area in which
they will experience how the farms food is grown and how they taste. 

In general, OGL is both an agricultural farm and theme park. There have been a
few businesses similar to this type of setup but those were ultimately
unsuccessful. OGL will incorporate the newest technology and be able to provide
an abundance of food for China’s population. They are also located near a famous
mausoleum not far away which will influence potential tourist to visit their
theme park. OGL believes that it will be able to dominate its own market as a
farm/theme park hybrid with little to no competition.


Company Description
OGL Holdings Ltd. is an early-stage ecologically conscious company formed to 
design, build and manage an ecological theme park showcasing agriculturally 
advanced technologies and to produce organic agricultural food utilizing such 
technology for efficient and non-destructive production. Rapid


 growth, 
ecological ignorance, and corporate indifference are things that the Company 
believes have contributed to the major pollution situation facing China. The 
Company believes that China is just beginning to develop environmental and
ecological programs and the Company intends to help educate and advance these
new programs. The agricultural theme park will provide visitors fun attractions
and exhibitions including hand picking fruit, seeing high-tech greenhouse
cultivation as well as theme park type amusements. The park will provide
visitors the opportunity to see the layout and operation of a high-tech smart
greenhouse for organic plant cultivation and then use these models for their
farms and greenhouses. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in January, 2015, and was
formerly known as Red Grotto Acquisition Corporation. 

In September, 2015, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming
shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing
new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing
officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the
shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company’s name from Red Grotto Acquisition Corporation to OGL
Holdings Ltd.
---

On February 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with
Jiangsu O.G.L. Ecological Agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu
OGL”). Jiangsu OGL has a business license to operate in China to develop an
agricultural business in farming, and buying and selling agricultural produce
that includes: vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs. The license also allows

Park in Jiangsu, China. Jiangsu OGL has a land use contract with the Jiangsu

OGL
HOLDINGS LTD. 

NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September
30, 2016 and 2015

(Unaudited)

 

NOTE 1
– NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

As used
herein and except as otherwise noted, the term
“Company”, “it(s)”, “our”,
“us”, “we” and “OGL” shall mean
OGL Holdings Ltd., a Delaware corporation.

 

OGL
Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as Red Grotto Acquisition
Corporation) (the “Company”), was incorporated in the
State of Delaware on January 12, 2015, to engage in any lawful
corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected
mergers and acquisitions. In March 2015, Red Grotto Acquisition
Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Form 10, by which the Company became a
public reporting company.

 

In
September, 2015, the Company exercised a change of control by
redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new
shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the
resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In
connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the
Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change
of the Company’s name from Red Grotto Acquisition Corporation
to OGL Holdings Ltd.

 

OGL
Holdings Ltd. is an early-stage ecologically conscious company
formed to design, build and manage an ecological theme park
showcasing agriculturally advanced technologies and to produce
organic agricultural food utilizing such technology for efficient
and non-destructive production. Rapid growth, ecological ignorance,
and corporate indifference are things that the Company believes
have contributed to the major pollution situation facing China. The
Company believes that China is just beginning to develop
environmental and ecological programs and the Company intends to
help educate and advance these new programs. The agricultural theme
park will provide visitors fun attractions and exhibitions
including hand picking fruit, seeing high-tech greenhouse
cultivation as well as theme park type amusements. The park will
provide visitors the opportunity to see the layout and operation of
a high-tech smart greenhouse for organic plant cultivation and then
use these models for their farms and greenhouses.

 

Basis of
Presentation

The
accompanying (a) condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has
been derived from the Company’s audited statements, and (b)
the condensed unaudited financial statements as of and for the
periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements,
and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and related footnotes included in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
(the “2015 Annual Report”), filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 30,
2016.  It is management’s opinion, however, that
all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments), have been made which are necessary for a fair
financial statements presentation. The financial statements include
all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
necessary to make the financial statements not misleading as
required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01. Operating results for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
of the results of operations expected for the year ending December
31, 2016.

 

Going
Concern

The
Company’s financial statements are prepared using generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. The Company expects to generate revenues through its
operation of its Organic Exhibition Garden and an Eco-Agricultural
Tourism Theme Park in China. Revenue will consist of sales from
entrance tickets to the tourist theme park and selling of produce
grown in its agricultural gardens. The Company has sustained
operating losses since inception to date and allow it to continue
as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going
concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its
shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary
financing to continue operations, and the attainment of growth and
profits from its operations. The Company has incurred a net loss of
$44,719 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, has a working
capital deficit of $75,465, and has an accumulated deficit of
$157,960 as of September 30, 2016. These factors, among others
raise a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain
adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The
following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company
is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s
financial statements. The financial statements and notes are the
representation of the Company’s management who is responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. The financial statements of
the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).

NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September
30, 2016 and 2015

(Unaudited)

 

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and
assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various
other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and
the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company
may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s
estimates of valuation of equity instruments. To the extent there
are material differences between the estimates and the actual
results, future results of operations will be affected.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of
three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash
equivalents. The Company did not have any cash or cash equivalents
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.

 

Fair
value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value
Measurements

Accounting
Standards Codifications (“ASC”) ASC 820, “
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, 
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of
independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to
measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization
within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820
prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to
measure fair value:

 

Level
1

Level 1
applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 

Level
2

Level 2
applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other
than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less
active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data.

 

Level
3

Level 3
applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable
inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the
measurement of the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.

 

The
Company’s financial instruments consist principally of
accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party. Pursuant
to ASC 820 and ASC 825, “ Financial Instruments”
, the fair value of our accrued liabilities and loan payable to a
related party is determined based on “Level 1” inputs,
which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all of the
other financial instruments approximate their current fair values
because of their nature and respective maturity dates or
durations.

 

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; price is fixed or
determinable; and collectability of the related receivable is
reasonably assured. The Company closely follows the provisions of
ASC 605 “ Revenue Recognition ”, which includes
the guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 as described
above.  The Company has not recognized any revenue for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Common Share

The
Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with
ASC 260, “ Earnings per Share” . ASC 260
requires presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per
share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to
common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS
gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is
used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased
from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS
excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is
anti-dilutive.

 

Licensing
Rights  

Licensing
rights which are stated at cost, relate to the cost of obtaining
the license to build Organic Exhibition Garden and an
Eco-Agricultural Tourism Theme Park in China. Cost is based on the
third party expenditures incurred for obtaining licensing rights.
The Company will begin amortizing licensing cost over their
estimated remaining useful life when it begins revenue-producing
activities. We will determine the useful life of licensing rights
after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to
each such asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives
include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset,
the historical performance of the asset, our long-term strategy for
using the asset, any laws or other local regulations that could
impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors,
including competition and specific market conditions.

Equity
Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring Goods or
Services

Issuances
of the Company’s common stock or warrants for acquiring goods
or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued,
whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the
fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or
vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a
commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is
reached (a “performance commitment” which would include
a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently
large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which
performance is complete. However, situations may arise in which
counter performance may be required over a period of time but the
equity award granted to the party performing the service is fully
vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the agreement. As a
result, in this situation in which vesting periods do not exist as
the instruments fully vested on the date of agreement, the Company
determines such date to be the measurement date and will record the
estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid
expense and amortize such amount to general and administrative
expense in the accompanying statement of operations over the
contract period. When it is appropriate for the Company to
recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting
periods prior to the measurement date, for purposes of recognition
of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at
the then-current fair values at each of those interim financial
reporting dates.

 

Non-Cash
Equity Transactions

Shares of
equity instruments issued for non-cash consideration are recorded
at the estimated fair market value of the consideration granted
based on the estimated fair market value of the equity instrument,
or at the estimated fair market value of the goods or services
received whichever is more readily determinable.

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method in accordance with ASC 740, “ Income
Taxes” . The asset and liability method provides that
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and
for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax
rates and laws. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.

 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, “ Accounting
for Uncertain Income Tax Positions .” When tax returns
are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken
or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax
position is recognized in the financial statements in the period
during which, based on all available evidence, management believes
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation
processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated
with other positions. Tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely
of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing
authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax
positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in
the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest
and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
examination.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

We qualify
as an “ emerging growth company ” under the 2012
JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth
company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended
transition period.

 

Debt
Issuance Costs

In April
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), ASU
2015-03, " Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ".
This standard update requires an entity to present debt issuance
costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related
debt liability as opposed to an asset. Amortization of the costs
will continue to be reported as interest expense. The update is
effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting
periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015.
Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not
been previously issued, and the new guidance would be applied
retrospectively to all prior periods presented.  The Company
has not adopted ASU 2015-02 as of September 30, 2016, and the
adoption is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

 

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In May
2014, and later amended in August 2015, FASB issued new ASU
regarding revenue recognition under GAAP. This new guidance will
supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance and, and
is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 31, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on the
Company’s financial statements.

 

In August
2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “ Presentation of
Financial Statements Going Concern ”, which requires
management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting
period, whether there are conditions or events that raise
substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date the financial
statements are issued and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15
is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and
interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

(Unaudited)

 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic
740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The
amendments in this update simplify the presentation of deferred
taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be
classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. These amendments may
be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and
assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The amendments
are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The
guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic
840), to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on
the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing
arrangements. The amendments in this standard are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, for a public entity. Early
adoption of the amendments in this standard is permitted for all
entities and the Company must recognize and measure leases at the
beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified
retrospective approach. The Company is currently in the process of
evaluating the effect this guidance will have on its financial
statements and related disclosures.

 

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board issues Accounting Standard
Updates to amend the authoritative literature in ASC. There have
been a number of ASUs to date that amend the original text of ASC.
The Company believes those issued to date either (i) provide
supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are
not applicable to the Company, or (iv) are not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	September 30, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited)




	 




	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND
	BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 



	As used herein and except as otherwise
	noted, the term “Company”, “it(s)”, “our”, “us”, “we” and “OGL”
	shall mean OGL Holdings Ltd., a Delaware corporation.



	 



	OGL Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as Red
	Grotto Acquisition Corporation) (the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 12, 2015, to
	engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. In March 2015, Red
	Grotto Acquisition Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10, by which
	the Company became a public reporting company.


	 


	In September, 2015, the Company exercised
	a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing new officers and
	directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control,
	the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Red
	Grotto Acquisition Corporation to OGL Holdings Ltd.


	 


	OGL Holdings Ltd. is an early-stage ecologically
	conscious company formed to design, build and manage an ecological theme park showcasing agriculturally advanced technologies and
	to produce organic agricultural food utilizing such technology for efficient and non-destructive production. Rapid growth, ecological
	ignorance, and corporate indifference are things that the Company believes have contributed to the major pollution situation facing
	China. The Company believes that China is just beginning to develop environmental and ecological programs and the Company intends
	to help educate and advance these new programs. The agricultural theme park will provide visitors fun attractions and exhibitions
	including hand picking fruit, seeing high-tech greenhouse cultivation as well as theme park type amusements. The park will provide
	visitors the opportunity to see the layout and operation of a high-tech smart greenhouse for organic plant cultivation and then
	use these models for their farms and greenhouses.


	 




	Basis of Presentation




	The accompanying
	(a) condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company’s audited statements, and (b) the condensed
	unaudited financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8
	of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
	principles for complete financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related
	footnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Annual
	Report”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 30, 2016.  It is management’s
	opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments), have been made which are necessary
	for a fair financial statements presentation. The financial statements include all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
	accruals) necessary to make the financial statements not misleading as required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01. Operating results
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations expected for the year
	ending December 31, 2016.



	 





	Going Concern




	The Company’s financial statements
	are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company expects
	to generate revenues through its operation of its Organic Exhibition Garden and an Eco-Agricultural Tourism Theme Park in China.
	Revenue will consist of sales from entrance tickets to the tourist theme park and selling of produce grown in its agricultural
	gardens. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception to date and allow it to continue as a going concern. The continuation
	of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company
	to obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of growth and profits from its operations. The Company
	has incurred a net loss of $44,719 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, has a working capital deficit of $75,465, and
	has an accumulated deficit of $157,960 as of September 30, 2016. These factors, among others raise a substantial doubt regarding
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced
	to cease operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification
	of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
	a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 


	The following summary of significant accounting
	policies of the Company is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial
	statements and notes are the representation of the Company’s management who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.
	The financial statements of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.
	GAAP).

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	September 30, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited)




	 





	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical
	experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
	for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s
	estimates of valuation of equity instruments. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual
	results, future results of operations will be affected.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	The Company considers all highly liquid
	instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any
	cash or cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.


	 




	Fair value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements




	Accounting Standards Codifications (“ASC”)
	ASC 820, “

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, 

	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
	inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based
	on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s
	categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
	ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:


	 



	Level 1



	Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities
	for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


	 



	Level 2



	Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities
	for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar
	assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume
	or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can
	be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.


	 



	Level 3



	Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities
	for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value
	of the assets or liabilities.


	 


	The Company’s
	financial instruments consist principally of accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party. Pursuant to ASC 820 and ASC
	825, “

	Financial Instruments”

	, the fair value of our accrued liabilities and loan payable to a related party
	is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The
	Company believes that the recorded values of all of the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because
	of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	The Company recognizes revenues when persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; price is fixed or determinable; and collectability of the related receivable
	is reasonably assured. The Company closely follows the provisions of ASC 605 “

	Revenue Recognition

	”, which includes
	the guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 as described above.  The Company has not recognized any revenue for
	the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 


	  




	Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share




	The Company computes net earnings (loss)
	per share in accordance with ASC 260, “

	Earnings per Share”

	. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and
	diluted net earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings
	(loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the
	period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
	method and convertible note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price
	for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants.
	Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 




	Licensing Rights


	 


	Licensing rights which are stated at cost,
	relate to the cost of obtaining the license to build Organic Exhibition Garden and an Eco-Agricultural Tourism Theme Park in China.
	Cost is based on the third party expenditures incurred for obtaining licensing rights. The Company will begin amortizing licensing
	cost over their estimated remaining useful life when it begins revenue-producing activities. We will determine the useful life
	of licensing rights after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each such asset. Factors we consider when
	determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the
	asset, our long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations that could impact the useful life of the
	asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions.

	September 30, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited)



	 




	Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring
	Goods or Services




	Issuances of the Company’s common
	stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value
	of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity
	instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance
	to earn the equity instruments is reached (a “performance commitment” which would include a penalty considered to be
	of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.
	However, situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time but the equity award granted to
	the party performing the service is fully vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the agreement. As a result, in this situation
	in which vesting periods do not exist as the instruments fully vested on the date of agreement, the Company determines such date
	to be the measurement date and will record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and
	amortize such amount to general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations over the contract period.
	When it is appropriate for the Company to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement
	date, for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at the then-current fair values
	at each of those interim financial reporting dates.


	 




	Non-Cash Equity Transactions




	Shares of equity instruments issued for
	non-cash consideration are recorded at the estimated fair market value of the consideration granted based on the estimated fair
	market value of the equity instrument, or at the estimated fair market value of the goods or services received whichever is more
	readily determinable.



	 





	Income Taxes




	The Company accounts for income taxes using
	the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “

	Income Taxes”

	. The asset and liability method provides
	that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
	the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company records a valuation allowance
	to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.


	 


	The Company follows the provisions of ASC
	740-10, “

	Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions

	.” When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that
	some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about
	the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance
	of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all
	available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including
	the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
	Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is
	more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits
	associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for
	unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable
	to the taxing authorities upon examination.


	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	We qualify as an “

	emerging growth
	company

	” under the 2012 JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage
	of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting
	standards. As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would
	otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.


	 




	Debt Issuance
	Costs




	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), ASU 2015-03, "

	Interest—Imputation
	of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

	". This standard update requires an
	entity to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability as opposed to
	an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The update is effective for annual reporting
	periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted
	for financial statements that have not been previously issued, and the new guidance would be applied retrospectively to all prior
	periods presented.  The Company has not adopted ASU 2015-02 as of September 30, 2016, and the adoption is not expected to
	have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.


	 




	New Accounting Pronouncements




	In May 2014, and later amended in August
	2015, FASB issued new ASU regarding revenue recognition under GAAP. This new guidance will supersede nearly all existing revenue
	recognition guidance and, and is effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2017.
	Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
	of this new guidance on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2014-15, “

	Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern

	”, which requires management to evaluate, at each
	annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s
	ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures.
	ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter. The guidance is not
	expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
	Income Taxes (Topic 740):

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.

	The amendments in this update simplify the presentation
	of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. These amendments
	may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The
	amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
	within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
	period. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	(Topic 840), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease
	liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendments in this standard are
	effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for a public
	entity. Early adoption of the amendments in this standard is permitted for all entities and the Company must recognize and measure
	leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently in the
	process of evaluating the effect this guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	 


	The Financial Accounting Standards Board
	issues Accounting Standard Updates to amend the authoritative literature in ASC. There have been a number of ASUs to date that
	amend the original text of ASC. The Company believes those issued to date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical
	corrections, (iii) are not applicable to the Company, or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.

	NOTE 4 – LICENSING RIGHTS




	 





	On February 26, 2016, the Company executed
	a Licensing Agreement (the “License”) with Jiangsu OGL Ecological Agriculture Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (‘Jiangsu
	OGL”), a company formed under the laws of China. Jiangsu OGL has a (i) business license to operate farming, buy and sell
	agriculture produce, food processing, permits to build resort units in tourism theme parks, (ii) leasing agreement for 7,020 acres
	of farmland with Jiangsu Provincial Government for 50 years starting November 26, 2013, and (iii) 49,136 sq. meters Organic Exhibition
	Garden open to the public for an entrance fee, where visitors can view and experience the greenhouses, plants and purchase fresh
	produce. The Company has an exclusive right to use Jiangsu OGL’s business license to operate and develop the agricultural
	business in Jiangsu and develop an Eco-Agricultural Tourism Theme Park on 7,020 acres of farmland (Note 7). The Company has agreed
	to pay (i) Jiangsu OGL an annual licensing fee of $100,000 for the Organic Exhibition Tourism Theme Park one year after Jiangsu
	OGL receives the operation permit of the Organic Exhibition Center from the Government, (ii) Jiangsu OGL’s major partner
	OGL Group Pte Ltd. $1,000,000 in cash 6 months after Jiangsu OGL receives the operation permit of the Organic Exhibition Center
	from the Government, and (iii) issue 1,222,000 shares of the common stock at the par value of $0.0001 per share to 38 Jiangsu OGL
	shareholders since the majority shareholders of Jiangsu OGL are also the principal Officers of the Company, and currently the Company’s
	stock is not trading due to the registration statement not being effective (Note 6). The Company has acquired the License and has
	issued 1,222,000 common shares valued at $122 on February 26, 2016. The Company, Jiangsu OGL, and OGL Group Pte. Ltd. have common
	management and are under common control. The Company has not included the $1,000,000 cash consideration payable in the total valuation
	of licensing rights since the Company has not paid the cash consideration of $1,000,000 as of September 30, 2016. The Company has
	recorded License Rights at $122 based on the par value of 1,222,000 common shares at September 30, 2016. The Company has not started
	generating revenues as a result of obtaining exclusive License. The Company will start amortizing the License over the remaining
	term of the lease of farmland which expires on November 25, 2063, once the Company starts earning revenues due to the usage of
	farmland and License.


	 




	On August 18, 2016, the Company and Jiangsu
	OGL entered into a memorandum to agree to mutually postpone the Organic Exhibition Garden operation until receiving the permit
	to operate from the Government which is expected to be issued within the next six months. The first annul licensing fee that was
	due by March 30, 2017 was postponed until one year after receipt of the permit to operate.

	The discussion in this section contains
	forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. We have attempted to
	identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,”
	“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,”
	“plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “would” or “will”
	or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.
	These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause our
	actual results to differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. Several risks and uncertainties we face
	are discussed in more detail under “Risk Factors” in

	 

	the 2015 Annual Report filed with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016

	. 

	You should, however, understand that it is not possible to predict or identify
	all risks and uncertainties and you should not consider the risks and uncertainties identified by us to be a complete set of all
	potential risks or uncertainties that could materially affect us. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements
	we make herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong. We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking
	statements contained herein to reflect future events and developments, except as required by law.

	 

	The following discussion
	and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited financial statements
	and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing in the 2015 Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission on March 30, 2016 and elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities
	and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.



	 


	OGL Holding Ltd is an early-stage development
	company. As of the periods from inception, through the date of this report, we did not generate any revenue and incurred minimal
	expenses and operating losses, as part of its development stage activities. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on January
	12, 2015, and we were formerly known as Red Grotto Acquisition Corporation. In March 2015, Red Grotto Acquisition Corporation filed
	a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10 by which it became a public reporting company.
	 


	 


	The Company is an early-stage ecologically
	conscious company formed to design, build and manage an ecological theme park showcasing agriculturally advanced technologies and
	to produce organic agricultural food utilizing such technology for efficient and non-destructive production. The agricultural theme
	park will provide visitors fun attractions and exhibitions including hand picking fruit, seeing high-tech green house cultivation
	as well as theme park type amusements. The park will provide visitors the opportunity to see the layout and operation of a high-tech
	smart greenhouse for organic plant cultivation and then use these models for their farms and greenhouses.


	 



	Anticipated Timeline, Cost and Summary
	of Business Plan



	 


	On February 26, 2016, the Company signed
	an agreement with Jiangsu O.G.L. Ecological Agriculture Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu OGL”). This agreement
	grants the Company an exclusive right to use Jiangsu OGL’s business license to operate, develop agriculture and tourism business
	on 7,020 acres farmland in Jiangsu, China. The Company will also lease and operate the Organic Exhibition Garden that is owned
	by Jiangsu OGL.


	 




	The Organic Exhibition Garden is 49,136
	square meters in size and is located on the 7,020 acres farmland in Jiangsu, China (

	www.jsogl.com

	). It is now open to the
	public for an entrance fee RMB50 (USD$7.8) for the visitors. The visitors can view and experience the greenhouses, plants, and
	purchase fresh produce. The Company will pay $100,000 leasing fee for the Organic Exhibition Garden with the first leasing fee
	due on June 30, 2017. Starting the beginning of 2017, the Company will start earning revenues from Organic Exhibition Garden through
	the entrance ticket and the selling of the produce from the Garden.


	 


	The Company will pay an aggregate value
	of $6,499,000 for the exclusive right to use Jiangsu OGL’s business license and the right to lease the Organic Exhibition
	Garden. This aggregate value includes 1,222,000 shares, equivalent to $5,499,000 (calculated at $4.50 per share), to 38 Jiangsu
	OGL shareholders. The balance of $1,000,000 will be paid in cash to Jiangsu OGL’s major partner (OGL Group Pte. Ltd.) 6 months
	after the Company receives the operation permit of the Organic Exhibition Center from the Government. The Organic Exhibition Garden
	terms and conditions will be renegotiated every 2 years.


	 


	Jiangsu O.G.L. is owned by OGL Group Pte.
	Ltd. Mr. Lim Kun Lim and Ms. Tian Chunzhi are the major shareholders of the company and the acquisition is not deemed as an arm’s
	length transaction.


	 


	Mr. Lim, Chairman and President of the
	OGL Holdings Ltd., agreed to pay all operation expenses for the Company as Director’s loan with no interest calculated until
	the Company can raise sufficient funds for its operation and project development.


	 


	The Company anticipates that it will need
	approximately $1,500,000 to execute the licensing agreement and the operations of the Organic Exhibition Garden are expected to
	commence sometime at the beginning of 2017.


	 


	As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
	no cash and has earned no revenues nor realized any profits. The Company intends to make an equity offering of its common stock
	for the acquisition and operation expenses. If it cannot raise the required cash, the Company will issue additional shares of common
	stock in lieu of cash.

	In September, 2015, the Company exercised
	a change of control by redeeming shares of its existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing new officers
	and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control,
	the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Red
	Grotto Acquisition Corporation to OGL Holdings Ltd.


	 


	The Company’s financial statements
	are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have not yet established
	an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. We funded our
	operations primarily through the financial support from our officers and shareholders. The continuation of the Company as a going
	concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary
	financing to continue operations, and the attainment of growth and profitable operations. We incurred a net loss of $44,719 for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, had a working capital deficit of $75,465 and an accumulated deficit of $157,960 as of
	September 30, 2016. These factors, among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.


	 



	Financial Operations Overview



	 




	Revenue




	 


	We have not earned revenues from our operations
	since January 12, 2015 (inception) to September 30, 2016, respectively. We expect to earn revenues from operations commencing sometime
	in the beginning of 2017.


	 




	Operating Expenses




	 




	Operating expenses for the three months
	and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $18,469 and $44,319, compared to $454 and $1,166 for the same comparable periods
	in 2015. Operating expenses increased by $18,015 and $43,153 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
	to the same comparable periods in 2015, primarily due to the increase in legal, professional, EDGAR, XBRL filing fees and accounting
	fees incurred for complying with the rules of the SEC. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase materially
	as we operate as a public company. These increases will likely to include salaries and benefits, legal and consulting fees, accounting
	and audit fees, director fees, directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums, fees for investor relations services, enhanced
	business and accounting systems, and other costs associated with operations.  


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	Since our inception, our operations have
	been primarily financed through funding from the officers and shareholders.


	 




	For the nine months ended September 30,
	2016, we had no cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our existing capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our projected
	operating requirements for at least the next 12 months and we will need to raise additional capital. Based on our operating plan,
	we will need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for operating the Organic Exhibition Garden and
	Eco-Agricultural Tourism Theme Park. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. To fund future operations,
	we will need to raise additional capital. Funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at any terms. If we are unable
	to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or even suspend development of future park
	exhibits. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt
	financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. To the
	extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances
	or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights associated with our License Agreement future
	revenue streams, and we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital
	through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms
	of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders’ rights. If we raise
	additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific
	actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have been prepared on a basis that contemplates the realization of assets and
	the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have continuing net losses and deficiencies
	in working capital as of most of the balance sheet dates. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
	as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities
	that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. These circumstances caused our independent registered
	public accounting firm to include an explanatory paragraph in their report dated March 30, 2016, regarding their concerns about
	our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our ability to obtain additional
	financing as may be required to fund current operations. Management’s plans include selling its equity securities and obtaining
	debt or other financing to fund its capital requirement and on-going operations; however, there can be no assurance the Company
	will be successful in these efforts. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
	as a going concern.

	Operating Activities




	 


	Net cash used in operating activities for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $20,055, which resulted primarily due to the net loss of $44,719, depreciation of
	$5,260 and increase in accrued liabilities of $19,404.


	 




	Financing Activities





	 



	Net cash provided by financing activities
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $20,055, which resulted primarily due to net proceeds from loans from related
	party in the amount of $20,055.




	 






	Non-cash Investing and Financing
	Activities




	 


	The Company acquired property and equipment
	of $36,006 and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer paid the acquisition cost on behalf of the Company. The Company acquired
	the Licensing Rights to operate and develop the agriculture business and to build and develop a 3,000 acre Eco-Agricultural Tourism
	Theme Park, and agreed to pay $1,000,122 in exchange of the licensing rights, of which $1,000,000 still remain payable as of September
	30, 2016.


	 



	Alternative Financial Planning



	 


	The Company has no alternative financial
	plans at the moment. If the Company is not able to successfully raise funds as needed through a private placement or other securities
	offering (including, but not limited to, a primary public offering of securities), the Company will not be able to implement its
	business plan as a going concern.


	 



	Equipment Financing



	 


	The Company has no existing equipment financing
	arrangements.


	 




	Critical Accounting Policies and
	Significant Judgments and Estimates




	 


	Our management’s discussion and analysis
	of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which we have prepared in accordance
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
	the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We have identified
	the following accounting policies that we believe require application of management’s most subjective judgments, often requiring
	the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our
	actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material.


	 


	While our significant accounting policies
	are described in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in our Annual Report filed with the SEC on March
	30, 2016, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
	our financial statements.   


	 




	JOBS Act Accounting Election




	 


	We are an “

	emerging growth company

	,”
	as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards
	issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably
	elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will be subject to the
	same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.


	 





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments
	and Fair Value Measurements



	 


	ASC 820, “Fair

	 Value Measurements
	and Disclosures”, 

	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
	inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence
	surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy
	is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


	 



	Development Stage and Capital Resources



	 


	The Company has devoted substantially all
	of its efforts to business planning since its inception on January 12, 2015. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the
	development stage. The Company has not generated revenues from its operations, and it will not commence generating revenues until
	sometime during 2017.




	 





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	 We have not engaged in any off-balance
	sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(c) of the SEC’s Regulation S-B. We did not have any relationships with unconsolidated
	organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special-purpose entities that would have been established
	for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

	Item 3.






	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk






	 


	As a smaller reporting company as defined
	by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and as provided in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation
	S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and, therefore, are not required to provide the information requested
	by this Item.




	 











	Item 4.






	Controls and Procedures






	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 



	As of the end of the period covered by
	this report on Form 10-Q, our President (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of
	the effectiveness of and the operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e)
	under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that as of the end of
	the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to
	material information relating to OGL Holdings Ltd. required to be included in our Exchange Act filings.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal
	control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule
	15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.






	   





	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION



	 










	Item
	1.






	Legal Proceedings






	 


	From time to time, we may become involved
	in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The impact and outcome of litigation,
	if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and any adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that
	could harm our business. The Company’s officers and directors are not aware of any threatened or pending litigation to which
	the Company is a party or which any of its property is the subject and which would have any material, adverse effect on the Company.
