John F. Crowley
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer


														John F. Crowley is our Chairman and CEO.  John's involvement with biotechnology stems from the 1998 diagnosis of two of his children with Pompe disease—a severe and often fatal neuromuscular disorder. In his drive to find a cure for them, he left his position at Bristol-Myers Squibb and became an entrepreneur as the Co-founder, President and CEO of Novazyme Pharmaceuticals, a biotech start-up conducting research on a new experimental treatment for Pompe disease (which he credits as ultimately saving his children's lives). In 2001, Novazyme was acquired by Genzyme Corporation and John continued to play a lead role in the development of a drug for Pompe disease as Senior Vice President, Genzyme Therapeutics.

The major motion picture, Extraordinary Measures, starring Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford, is inspired by the Crowley family journey.  John is the author of a personal memoir:  Chasing Miracles: The Crowley Family Journey of Strength, Hope, and Joy.
John is also a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve, assigned to the United States Special Operations Command and is a veteran of the global war on terrorism, with service in Afghanistan. He graduated with a B.S. in Foreign Service from Georgetown University, and earned a J.D. from the University of Notre Dame Law School and an M.B.A. from Harvard.  The Crowley family was the recipient of the 2011 Family Exemplar Award from the University of Notre Dame.  He is also a member of the University Council on Science & Technology at Notre Dame.

Nasdaq extends win streak as stocks digest latest political drama

Amicus Therapeutics's stock soars on heavy volume after FDA clears NDA submission for Fabry disease treatment
Shares of Amicus Therapeutics Inc.  shot up 40% toward a 22-month high in active premarket trade Tuesday, after the biotechnology company said the Food and Drug Administration cleared the company to submit a new drug application for its Fabry disease treatment. Volume approached 600,000 shares about 90 minutes before the open, making the stock the most actively traded in the premarket session. The company said it plans to submit an NDA for oral precision medicine migalastat in the fourth quarter of 2017. "We are moving ahead expeditiously with our NDA submission and accelerating the U.S. pathway for migalastat," said Chief Executive John Crowley. "Today is a seminal moment in the development of migalastat and a testament to the dedication and perseverance of the patients, physicians and employees who have worked so hard on the development of this precision medicine." The stock had doubled year to date through Monday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 17% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.4%.

Sales Growth Analysis: Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (FOLD), Avon Products, Inc. (AVP)

By Luis Castro -   July 17, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOLD) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 191.16% since bottoming out at $4.41 on Dec. 22, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 22.99% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 158.35% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -3.34% from $13.28 , the 52-week high touched on Jul. 11, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 125.66% for the past 12 months.
FOLD Target Price Reaches $14.92
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (FOLD)’s shares projecting a $14.92 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (FOLD)’s Sales Declined?
 FOLD’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -25.4% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter decrease of 0% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Avon Products, Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -2315.58%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin -4%, and the sector’s average is -8.61%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -47.7% since hitting a peak level of $6.96 on Oct. 25, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -0.55% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -27.78% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 12.35% higher from $3.24, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on May. 30, 2017, but are collecting gains at -32.84% for the past six months.
Analysts See Avon Products, Inc. 0.97% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Avon Products, Inc. (AVP) to grow. At recent closing price of $3.64, AVP has a chance to add $0.97 or 26.65% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($4.61) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.7 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.85 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Avon Products, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly -16.7%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 5%, annually.
Is AVP Turning Profits into Returns?
 Avon Products, Inc. (AVP)’s ROE is 0%, while industry’s is 13.46%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 61.24%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Avon Products, Inc.’s ROA is 0.73%, while industry’s average is 5.85%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 26.8. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.
