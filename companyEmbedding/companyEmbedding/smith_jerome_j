You can hire an exterminator to kill or keep pests such as cockroaches, termites and rats at bay.Many companies either have technicians on staff or hire commercial pest control operators to keep their facilities clean and compliant with health codes and other regulations. While your house doesn't need to meet the same stringent codes a restaurant might, you likely want to keep your home safe from bugs and mice. Besides being general pests, termites, carpenter ants and other vermin can destroy the structural integrity of your home, making it unsafe for anyone to live in.What to Ask a Pest Control CompanyIt's important to ask the right questions before hiring a pest control company. You need to know whether the exterminators do quality work and if they know the proper ways to kill pests without exposing you and your family to potentially harmful chemicals. Here's a list of questions you must ask any extermination company to ensure you hire the best people for the job:Are You Licensed?
Pest control experts must be licensed in your state to do their work since they handle powerful pesticides and insecticides. Make sure the company you go with is registered with your state. You can verify a business's license through your state's pesticide regulatory office.Are You Bonded or Insured?
Just like any other professional working in or on your property, you want to ensure they're bonded. Being bonded or insured means any damage they do to your home will be covered by an insurance company instead of you.How Long Have You Been in Business?
You want a veteran extermination company that knows how to handle all types of pests. A company that's been in business for a number of years will have more experience trapping or killing a wide range of bugs and rodents than a relative newcomer.Do You Guarantee Your Work?
You wouldn't want to call a pest control technician out to spray your home and have roaches or rats return in just a few days, would you? Get a guarantee for the work that is done. Additionally, be wary of exterminators who ask you to sign a long contract with them. If you must sign an extended pledge, ensure you can cancel it at any time.May I Have a List of References?
Ask your friends, family and neighbors if they can recommend any reputable pest control operators. If they can't, ask the company itself for a list of references you can contact.Will I Need to Leave My House or Place of Business?
An exterminator might require you to leave your house or workplace depending on the seriousness of the infestation or the chemicals used to annihilate the bugs or rodents. Ask him or her what chemicals they plan to use, when it's safe to return to your home or commercial building and if the treatment spray could harm children or pets.Remember that you can better avoid scammers by ensuring all the technicians with the pest control company you hire are licensed as well as bonded.Pests You Can Get Help WithYou may need to seek the help of an exterminator depending on the type of pest and the amount of infestation your residence or commercial building has. While you can use glue traps and insecticide to kill off a few cockroaches, these measures are no match for large clusters and colonies of insects or rodents. Here's a list of creatures you should contact a pest control technician about:Termites
Contact a professional exterminator as soon as possible if you suspect your property has termites. Termites can cause costly damage to your home or building in a small amount of time.
Besides eating into wood and causing destruction to your foundation, termite nests are also hard to locate. With that said, look for cracked paint along the wooden surfaces of your home and tap beams and pillars every once in a while. If you hear a hollow sound, you might have a termite infestation.Carpenter Ants
Other culprits that can damage your house include carpenter ants. Like termites, they are bugs that burrow into buildings, damaging insulation, floors and walls. Unlike ants that build underground colonies and hills in your yard, carpenter ants are usually found living in trees. However, many times this species of ant will make a home for itself under your roof. It's smart to enlist the help of an experienced pest control company when handling carpenter ants since they're known to cause as much damage to buildings as termites.Bed Bugs
If you have bed bugs but want to keep getting a good night's sleep, you should contact an exterminator, as this pest spreads easily. Unfortunately, knowing whether or not you have bed bugs is difficult until you feel an itch on your skin or find their bites on you.Controlling the spread of this pest is notoriously challenging, which is why you should employ a professional. Bed bugs feed on blood and make their homes on mattresses and other pieces of furniture. So wash your laundry frequently, steam clean your mattress and seek out the guidance of an exterminator in order to go back to sleeping in comfort.Ants
The common ant, unlike its carpenter ant cousin, won't destroy parts of your home. However, a trail of bugs is something no one wants in their house. Ants usually enter a building looking for a sugary food source and will leave a scented trail for the rest of the colony to follow. This is why it's better to eradicate the whole group instead of just the handful you might find in your home.Cockroaches
Roaches are a nuisance no one likes to deal with. However, many homes, condos and apartments have them. Unsanitary conditions, such as leaving food out, dirty dishes in the sink or failing to take out the garbage, attract cockroaches into your living space.Winged Insects
Regular bees, bumble bees, hornets, wasps and yellow jackets can take over your backyard, making sitting on your deck a challenge. Some insects such as bees can be good for your garden since they help pollinate plants. However, you don't want your property swarming with stinging insects. There are preventative measures you can take, as well as special formulated insecticides, but it's best to contact a professional. Exterminators and beekeepers have the protective gear required to handle stinging bugs and can remove the insects without anyone getting hurt.Rats and Mice
Rats are not just an irritant; they also pose risks to your health and to your home. While rats, mice and other rodents can burrow holes in your house, rats also carry disease in the form of fleas in their fur. Bait, poison and mechanical spring-loaded traps can eliminate them.Wildlife
While you want some animals off your lawn and out of your house, you don't want to exterminate all pests, especially wildlife like deer, raccoons and squirrels. They may eat your plants but you will want to ward them off or either find a safe and humane way to trap and release them.There are some great do-it-yourself tricks you can use, such as connecting small bungee cords to your trash can lids to keep raccoons from going through your garbage. However, if you find an opossum, snake or other varmint in your house, you should call a professional pest control company to reduce your chance of getting bit or otherwise injured. An expert knows how to humanely trap mammals or reptiles and keep them out of your home.Pest Control MethodsThere's a whole range of pest control methods and customized solutions for killing insects, mammals and reptiles, as well as preventing them from returning. Unfortunately, there isn't one approach that will keep all pests at bay. Here are a few ways you can eliminate or discourage critters from making camp in your residence or yard:Inspection and Exclusion
Before you or an exterminator sets out bait, traps or poison, it's best to thoroughly check your home and pinpoint where the pests are coming from. Look for cracks or openings in your residence. After that, the professional will locate where the bugs or other animals are living and set traps or spray insecticide accordingly.He or she will also suggest ways to keep future pests out, either by caulking up holes or by explaining what you might be doing that's attracting the vermin.Traps
A trap can run the gamut from sticky-padded glue traps that use an adhesive material to capture bugs and mice to milk jugs filled with sugar water that capture flies and wasps.If you hire professionals to kill or capture pests, ask them which traps will work best for your needs. They could suggest a particular glue trap if you have a frequent cockroach problem or a type of bait that's more effective in leading rodents to the trap.Baiting
Baits range from laying out food to entice pests into a trap to poisonous substances the bugs or rodents eat and take back to their colony or hive. The latter type of bait takes time to work but can be much more effective than spraying insects with a pesticide. It attacks and can eliminate all the other pests in the community.Spraying
Many commercial pest control operators will spray your house or yard with strong insecticides around nooks, crannies and other parts of your home where bugs are usually found. You can also do this yourself with store-bought sprays or purchase commercial grade pesticide to dilute with water.What to Expect from a VisitWhen pest control technicians visit your home or place of business, expect them to first identify what insect or other animal it is that's causing trouble. After identification, they will inspect your building to see where the pests are coming from and locate their hive or nest.Then the exterminator will spray or set out traps and bait according to which pest you have. The price for exterminators can range broadly since they can charge for a monthly inspection and treatment. The final bill also comes down to the square footage of your property.Pest Prevention TipsKeeping critters out of your house is easier said than done, but there are a number of preventative steps you can take, including:Disposing of garbage regularly.Not leaving food or drink out.Cleaning up after spills as soon as you can.Draining any standing water in your house or yard.Regularly mowing and raking your lawn.You might need to change your pest prevention approach with the seasons, however. If you find insects and other animals trying to get in through cracks or openings, use a caulk gun to fill the gaps. You'll also want to either use traditional bug spray or a citronella candle to keep bugs such as mosquitos away from you during the summer months.Eco-Friendly and Humane Pest ControlMany pest control experts now offer environmentally friendly treatment for your home and yard with insecticides that aren't as harsh for the ecosystem. Check with exterminators around your area to see if they provide these kinds of services.Also, keep bugs at bay and your plants free from harmful chemicals by spraying cedar oil or soapy water on your prized flowers. Ask your pest control company about no-kill traps you can use if you want to get mice, rabbits, opossums or other furry creatures out of your house without harming them.

Jerome Bruner and the process of education
 Jerome Bruner and the process of education. Jerome Bruner has made a profound contribution to our appreciation of the process of education and to the development of curriculum theory. We explore his work and draw out some important lessons for informal educators and those concerned with the practice of lifelong learning.

 It is surely the case that schooling is only one small part of how a culture inducts the young into its canonical ways. Indeed, schooling may even be at odds with a culture’s other ways of inducting the young into the requirements of communal living…. What has become increasingly clear… is that education is not just about conventional school matters like curriculum or standards or testing. What we resolve to do in school only makes sense when considered in the broader context of what the society intends to accomplish through its educational investment in the young. How one conceives of education, we have finally come to recognize, is a function of how one conceives of culture and its aims, professed and otherwise.(Jerome S. Bruner 1996: ix-x)
Jerome S. Bruner (1915- ) is one of the best known and influential psychologists of the twentieth century. He was one of the key figures in the so called ‘cognitive revolution’ – but it is the field of education that his influence has been especially felt. His books  The Process of Education and Towards a Theory of Instruction have been widely read and become recognized as classics, and his work on the social studies programme – Man: A Course of Study (MACOS) – in the mid-1960s is a landmark in curriculum development. More recently Bruner has come to be critical of the ‘cognitive revolution’ and has looked to the building of a cultural psychology that takes proper account of the historical and social context of participants. In his 1996 book The Culture of Education these arguments were developed with respect to schooling (and education more generally). ‘How one conceives of education’, he wrote, ‘we have finally come to recognize, is a function of how one conceives of the culture and its aims, professed and otherwise’ (Bruner 1996: ix-x).
Jerome S. Bruner – life
Bruner was born in New York City and later educated at Duke University and Harvard (from which he was awarded a PhD in 1947). During World War II, Bruner worked as a social psychologist exploring propaganda public opinion and social attitudes for U.S. Army intelligence. After obtaining his PhD he became a member of faculty, serving as professor of psychology, as well as cofounder and director of the Center for Cognitive Studies.
Beginning in the 1940s, Jerome Bruner, along with Leo Postman, worked on the ways in which needs, motivations, and expectations (or ‘mental sets’) influence perception. Sometimes dubbed as the ‘New Look’, they explored perception from a functional orientation (as against a process to separate from the world around it). In addition to this work, Bruner began to look at the role of strategies in the process of human categorization, and more generally, the development of human cognition. This concern with cognitive psychology led to a particular interest in the cognitive development of children (and their modes of representation) and just what the appropriate forms of education might be.
From the late 1950s on Jerome Bruner became interested in schooling in the USA – and was invited to chair an influential ten day meeting of scholars and educators at Woods Hole on Cape Cod in 1959 (under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation). One result was Bruner’s landmark book The Process of Education (1960). It developed some of the key themes of that meeting and was an crucial factor in the generation of a range of educational programmes and experiments in the 1960s. Jerome Bruner subsequently joined a number of key panels and committees (including the President’s Advisory Panel of Education). In 1963, he received the Distinguished Scientific Award from the American Psychological Association, and in 1965 he served as its president.
Jerome S. Bruner also became involved in the design and implementation of the influential MACOS project (which sought to produce a comprehensive curriculum drawing upon the behavioural sciences). The curriculum famously aimed to address three questions:
What is uniquely human about human beings?
How did they get that way?
How could they be made more so? (Bruner 1976: 74)
The project involved a number of young researchers, including Howard Gardner, who subsequently have made an impact on educational thinking and practice. MACOS was attacked by conservatives (especially the cross-cultural nature of the materials). It was also difficult to implement – requiring a degree of sophistication and learning on the part of teachers, and ability and motivation on the part of students. The educational tide had begun to move away from more liberal and progressive thinkers like Jerome Bruner.
In the 1960s Jerome Bruner developed a theory of cognitive growth. His approach (in contrast to Piaget) looked to environmental and experiential factors. Bruner suggested that intellectual ability developed in stages through step-by-step changes in how the mind is used. Bruner’s thinking became increasingly influenced by writers like Lev Vygotsky and he began to be critical of the intrapersonal focus he had taken, and the lack of attention paid to social and political context. In the early 1970s Bruner left Harvard to teach for several years at the university of Oxford. There he continued his research into questions of agency in infants and began a series of explorations of children’s language. He returned to Harvard as a visiting professor in 1979 and then, two years later, joined the faculty of the new School for Social Research in New York City. He became critical of the ‘cognitive revolution’ and began to argue for the building of a cultural psychology. This ‘cultural turn’ was then reflected in his work on education – most especially in his 1996 book: The Culture of Education. 
The process of education
The Process of Education (1960) was a landmark text. It had a direct impact on policy formation in the United States and influenced the thinking and orientation of a wide group of teachers and scholars, Its view of children as active problem-solvers who are ready to explore ‘difficult’ subjects while being out of step with the dominant view in education at that time, struck a chord with many. ‘It was a surprise’, Jerome Bruner was later to write (in the preface to the 1977 edition), that a book expressing so structuralist a view of knowledge and so intuitionist an approach to the process of knowing should attract so much attention in America, where empiricism had long been the dominant voice and ‘learning theory’ its amplifier’ (ibid.: vii).
Four key themes emerge out of the work around The Process of Education (1960: 11-16):
The role of structure in learning and how it may be made central in teaching. The approach taken should be a practical one. ‘The teaching and learning of structure, rather than simply the mastery of facts and techniques, is at the center of the classic problem of transfer… If earlier learning is to render later learning easier, it must do so by providing a general picture in terms of which the relations between things encountered earlier and later are made as clear as possible’ (ibid.: 12).
Readiness for learning. Here the argument is that schools have wasted a great deal of people’s time by postponing the teaching of important areas because they are deemed ‘too difficult’.
We begin with the hypothesis that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development. (ibid.: 33)
This notion underpins the idea of the spiral curriculum – ‘A curriculum as it develops should revisit this basic ideas repeatedly, building upon them until the student has grasped the full formal apparatus that goes with them’ (ibid.: 13).
Intuitive and analytical thinking. Intuition (‘the intellectual technique of arriving and plausible but tentative formulations without going through the analytical steps by which such formulations would be found to be valid or invalid conclusions’ ibid.: 13) is a much neglected but essential feature of productive thinking. Here Bruner notes how experts in different fields appear ‘to leap intuitively into a decision or to a solution to a problem’ (ibid.: 62) – a phenomenon that  Donald Schön was to explore some years later – and looked to how teachers and schools might create the conditions for intuition to flourish.
Motives for learning. ‘Ideally’, Jerome Bruner writes, interest in the material to be learned is the best stimulus to learning, rather than such external goals as grades or later competitive advantage’ (ibid.: 14). In an age of increasing spectatorship, ‘motives for learning must be kept from going passive… they must be based as much as possible upon the arousal of interest in what there is be learned, and they must be kept broad and diverse in expression’ (ibid.: 80).
Bruner was to write two ‘postscripts’ to The Process of Education: Towards a theory of instruction (1966) and The Relevance of Education (1971). In these books Bruner ‘put forth his evolving ideas about the ways in which instruction actually affects the mental models of the world that students construct, elaborate on and transform’ (Gardner 2001: 93). In the first book the various essays deal with matters such as patterns of growth, the will to learn, and on making and judging (including some helpful material around evaluation). Two essays are of particular interest – his reflections on MACOS (see above), and his ‘notes on a theory of instruction’. The latter essay makes the case for taking into account questions of predisposition, structure, sequence, and reinforcement in preparing curricula and programmes. He makes the case for education as a knowledge-getting process:
To instruct someone… is not a matter of getting him to commit results to mind. Rather, it is to teach him to participate in the process that makes possible the establishment of knowledge. We teach a subject not to produce little living libraries on that subject, but rather to get a student to think mathematically for himself, to consider matters as an historian does, to take part in the process of knowledge-getting. Knowing is a process not a product. (1966: 72)
The essays in The Relevance of Education (1971) apply his theories to infant development.
The culture of education
Jerome Bruner’s reflections on education in The Culture of Education (1996) show the impact of the changes in his thinking since the 1960s. He now placed his work within a thorough appreciation of culture: ‘culture shapes the mind… it provides us with the toolkit by which we construct not only our worlds but our very conception of our selves and our powers’ (ibid.: x). This orientation ‘presupposes that human mental activity is neither solo nor conducted unassisted, even when it goes on “inside the head” (ibid.: xi). It also takes Bruner well beyond the confines of schooling.
Conclusion
Jerome S. Bruner has had a profound effect on education – and upon those researchers and students he has worked with.  Howard Gardner has commented:
Jerome Bruner is not merely one of the foremost educational thinkers of the era; he is also an inspired learner and teacher. His infectious curiosity inspires all who are not completely jaded. Individuals of every age and background are invited to join in. Logical analyses, technical dissertations, rich and wide knowledge of diverse subject matters, asides to an ever wider orbit of information, intuitive leaps, pregnant enigmas pour forth from his indefatigable mouth and pen. In his words, ‘Intellectual activity is anywhere and everywhere, whether at the frontier of knowledge or in a third-grade classroom’. To those who know him, Bruner remains the Compleat Educator in the flesh… (Gardner 2001: 94)
