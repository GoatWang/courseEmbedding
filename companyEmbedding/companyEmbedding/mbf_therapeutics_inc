Our product development portfolio includes targeted that specifically disrupt tumor cell metabolism and stimulate potent, systemic immune responses that destroy tumors without affecting normal, healthy cells and organs.  Effective cancer treatment is o...ne of the most significant unmet needs in veterinary medicine today. As pets live longer, they are increasingly susceptible to a variety of age-related chronic conditions, including heart disease, kidney disease, obesity and cancer. It has been estimated that nearly half of all pets over the age of 10 will develop cancer.  Despite recent advances, including therapeutics adapted from human medicine, the primary cancer treatment options for dogs and cats are surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. These palliative measures offer only a nominal extension of life, often with a significant degradation of overall quality of life for pets and their owners.   MBFT’s state-of-the-art oncology products are intended to meet the growing demand for effective cancer therapies that address not only symptoms but also treat the underlying disease to bring patients into long-lasting remission that will extend and maintain good quality of life.   展开中文(简体)English (US)日本語한국어Français (France)Bahasa IndonesiaPolskiEspañolPortuguês (Brasil)DeutschItalianoMessengerFacebook Lite用户地点游戏位置名人二手市场小组食谱彩色气球Instagram公司简介创建广告创建主页开发者招聘信息隐私权政策Cookie广告选项条款设置活动日志 Facebook © 2017
