Home Care FAQ | Care Indeed











































  


Care Indeed (650) 328-1001 
Home Care FAQs

Q. What is Care Indeed Home Care Services?
A. Care Indeed provides  in-home caregiving services for the elderly in these counties: Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, San Francisco, and Contra Costa. We also cater to the needs of East Bay and its surrounding areas’ residents. We offer extensive in-home care services for seniors who embrace their independence and the personal dignity that goes with it. Our in-home care services are provided by insured caregivers who have passed a national criminal background check and have undergone an extensive interviewing  process and evaluation. If a senior family member needs in-home care services, we are an excellent provider with exemplary references.
Q. What is non-medical in-home care?
A. Generally for non-medical care, there are no intensive rehabilitative sessions, monitoring heart rhythms, or managing blood-sugar levels. Instead, we see that the basic needs of those who cannot fully function by themselves receive the appropriate care. Such needs include personal care, meal preparation, and maintaining a safe home environment.
Q. What type of caregiver can I expect?
A. The benefit of requesting a caregiver from our network is the assurance that your loved ones will receive care from a highly qualified, trained professional. Our company is staffed by certified nursing assistants, home health aides or home companions who are professional, educated, and experienced in elder care or children with disabilities. We know it is important that you feel safe letting someone come into your home, therefore, we require that all caregivers are screened as required by law and receive training in emergency response as well as in the nuances of backup care.
Q. What tips should I follow?
A. Once care has been scheduled, you can request that the agency call you and discuss the caregiver’s background or training and the specific needs of your family. Be prepared to discuss rules, meals, schedules, expectations, special needs, etc. We recommend that you schedule the caregiver to come to your home at least 30 minutes prior to needing care. This will give your family time to get acquainted with the caregiver, provide a tour of your home, answer any additional questions and provide rules, expectations and a list of your emergency contact information. Request our In-Home Care liability insurance when you schedule care, for your peace of mind.
Q. Can I request the same caregiver the next time I need backup care?
A. Our Backup Care Specialists will request the same caregiver as much as we can; however, this is not guaranteed due to caregiver availability, location and/or time constraints.
Q. Can my health insurance cover for the cost of home care?
A. Generally, Private pay, Medicare and Medicaid do not pay for long-term home care but long-term care insurance does cover the costs depending on what type of policy you have. We cater to the individual needs of our clients so they only pay for the services and care they require.
Q. Can I have home care in other locations aside from my home?
A. Yes, long-term care can be provided in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and retirement communities.  We also offer companionship services to clients during a hospital stay.
Q. What is In-home Respite?
A. In-home respite services consists of a caregiver who works in the family home so that the family member can leave the house for a period of time. These services are usually provided by our company. We recruit, screen, and train workers, with no contract and no long-term commitment for our clients. This type of respite is usually less disruptive to the individual needing care, provided there is a good match between the caregiver and the individual.
Q. What is an assessment of need?
A. An assessment means gathering all the relevant and vital information about you or the person receiving the care so your case is fully understood. The kind of assessment you have will depend on the informed needs. We may need to involve other people, such as your family, close family friends, or your doctor to understand your needs more thoroughly. However, we will always ask your permission before we contact them. All information is treated as confidential.
Q. Is home care only available for seniors?
A. No, home care is available to any person who requires any type of assistance from a caregiver. We provide care to people of all ages.
Q. Why should I choose home health care?
A. Home health care is another option for receiving health care services. With a private caregiver, a client can receive personalized care in a quick and effective manner. Many people also believe that returning to one’s home can sometimes speed up recovery as well as improve the quality of life for the family and the client.

What We Stand For









Our Company
Palo Alto Investors, LLC (PAI) is a leading private investment firm. We make long-term investments for high-net-worth and institutional investors based on original, deep, fundamental research. We don’t rent stocks. We own them. With over $1 billion in assets under management, we offer several healthcare sector funds. Significant partner ownership in all of our Funds serves to align our financial interests with the financial interests of our clients. At PAI our mission is to deliver superior returns to our clients by investing for the long term. At the core of our investment philosophy lies the belief that intensive, original research is required to discover and evaluate inefficiently priced equities. We generally focus our investments in micro cap and small cap U.S. equities, which are not closely followed by Wall Street sell-side research firms. We target the healthcare sector, as we believe it is an overlooked, misunderstood and undervalued segment of the market and has significant potential for appreciation. Our experienced research team has extensive clinical and industry experience in healthcare. They utilize a disciplined, bottom-up approach to identify promising investments, and the firm’s investment policies ensure liquidity horizons that are sufficient to take advantage of new opportunities. PAI is committed to providing exemplary client service, maintaining the highest level of ethics, operational excellence and professionalism. PAI is independently owned, and has been registered with the SEC since its inception in 1989.

                                            At PAI we conduct diligent, proprietary and fundamental research in market segments where research is most likely to reveal useful insights. 
                                        

















Investment Philosophy
Corporate Philosophy
Leadership is Key









Investment Philosophy
        Palo Alto Investors is committed to providing world class money management services. To that end, PAI offers several healthcare sector funds. The cornerstone of each Funds’ investment philosophy is our belief that intensive original research is required to discover and evaluate inefficiently priced equities. We have found that healthcare companies offer extraordinary risk/reward characteristics. They are often misperceived and can be badly mispriced.        Such companies are also chronically overlooked by Wall Street. Wall Street coverage is positively correlated to a company's market capitalization, leaving smaller-cap stocks with less coverage and greater opportunity for mispricing. "Closet indexing" by institutional investors increases the focus on the large cap stocks that make up substantial portions of popular benchmarks. Institutional investors often spend little effort researching micro-cap and small-cap opportunities because of their limited impact on major indices. This lack of coverage allows disciplined investors with in-house research capabilities such as Palo Alto Investors to buy stocks that trade for less than their intrinsic value. 





        At PAI we apply our expertise, original insight, independent thinking and exhaustive research process to identify companies that we believe are best positioned to achieve superior long-term performance. We intentionally avoid emerging growth stocks and instead seek to invest in fundamentally sound and capably-led businesses that are undervalued relative to their tangible assets, sustainable cash flow and unusual competitive advantages. And we invest for the long-term. Our goal is to identify opportunities and take advantage of them for our clients.

AGREEMENT TO TERMS OF USE
Please read the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Use”) before using the Palo Alto Investors, LLC (“PAI”) website (the “Site”).

You may not modify, copy (except as set forth below), distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, products or services obtained from the Site. You may not link other websites to the Site without the prior written permission of PAI. You may print one hardcopy of the information and download one temporary copy of the information into one single computer’s memory solely for your own personal, non-commercial use and not for distribution, provided that all relevant copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices are kept intact. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of the Site. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact PAI immediately for a new password. If you provide your password to any third party, you will be solely responsible for any actions taken by such third party using your password. All information on the non-public (i.e., password-restricted) areas of the Site is confidential and private and may not be disclosed or distributed by you to any other person for any purpose and is made available solely for your personal use in connection with your investment activities. You are prohibited from using the Site to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation. You also are prohibited from using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Site for any purpose without the prior written permission of PAI. You may not take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activities conducted on the Site, or bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR INVESTMENT ADVICE
The funds advised by PAI are not offered through the Site. An offer regarding any such fund may be made only after you have received a Confidential Offering Circular or Private Offering Memorandum concerning that fund and have had the opportunity to discuss all matters concerning any prospective investment that you desire. The Site does not provide all information material to an investor’s decision to invest in any such fund, including, but not limited to, risk factors. For more information, please refer to a fund’s Confidential Offering Circular or Private Offering Memorandum and read it carefully before you invest. The information on the Site is intended to enable investors to understand the nature of PAI’s financial advisory services. It is not intended as and does not constitute investment advice or legal or tax advice or an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any securities. The information in the Site should not be construed as any endorsement, recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security by PAI. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or retrieving any information found on the Site, and PAI urges you to make sure you understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Site. You should evaluate the information made available through the Site, and you should seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other information.PAI’s services are designed to integrate with the services provided by its clients’ other financial, legal and tax advisers, not to replace their services. PAI advises its clients from time to time on non-investment related matters, but clients must rely on their other professional advisers for final approval and/or implementation of non-investment matters.You acknowledge that any requests for information are unsolicited and any information provided shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice by PAI to you or constitute the formation of an investment advisory relationship, or any other client relationship. It is strongly recommended that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. PAI does not guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. PAI may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Site. 

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT COMPARABLE
The performance data presented in the Site reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and net figures reflect the deduction of expenses, management fees and incentive fees and allocations. PAI believes that the performance shown in the Site was generated with an investment philosophy and methodology similar to that described in the funds’ respective Confidential Offering Circulars and Private Offering Memoranda, which it would expect to use in the future. Future investments, however, will be made under different economic conditions and in different securities and may be made using different investment strategies than were used during the times discussed herein. Furthermore, the performance discussed herein reflects investment of limited funds for a limited period of time and does not reflect performance in different economic or market cycles. It should not be assumed that any fund advised by PAI will experience returns, if any, comparable to those described herein. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. The performance results have not been compiled, reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. Results for the current year are based on the internal books and records of each fund and are subject to adjustment when that fund’s financial statements for the current year are audited. PAI believes that the comparison of each fund’s performance to any single market index is inappropriate. These indices are provided for comparative purposes, but only as examples of general market performance. Unlike these indices, each fund’s portfolio may contain options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls) and other derivative securities, may include short sales of securities, margin trading and securities of smaller capitalization companies than those reflected in these indices, and is not as diversified as these indices. Due to the differences between the composition of a fund’s portfolio and these indices, PAI cautions potential investors that no such index is directly comparable to any fund

Home Care FAQ | Care Indeed











































  


Care Indeed (650) 328-1001 
Home Care FAQs

Q. What is Care Indeed Home Care Services?
A. Care Indeed provides  in-home caregiving services for the elderly in these counties: Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, San Francisco, and Contra Costa. We also cater to the needs of East Bay and its surrounding areas’ residents. We offer extensive in-home care services for seniors who embrace their independence and the personal dignity that goes with it. Our in-home care services are provided by insured caregivers who have passed a national criminal background check and have undergone an extensive interviewing  process and evaluation. If a senior family member needs in-home care services, we are an excellent provider with exemplary references.
Q. What is non-medical in-home care?
A. Generally for non-medical care, there are no intensive rehabilitative sessions, monitoring heart rhythms, or managing blood-sugar levels. Instead, we see that the basic needs of those who cannot fully function by themselves receive the appropriate care. Such needs include personal care, meal preparation, and maintaining a safe home environment.
Q. What type of caregiver can I expect?
A. The benefit of requesting a caregiver from our network is the assurance that your loved ones will receive care from a highly qualified, trained professional. Our company is staffed by certified nursing assistants, home health aides or home companions who are professional, educated, and experienced in elder care or children with disabilities. We know it is important that you feel safe letting someone come into your home, therefore, we require that all caregivers are screened as required by law and receive training in emergency response as well as in the nuances of backup care.
Q. What tips should I follow?
A. Once care has been scheduled, you can request that the agency call you and discuss the caregiver’s background or training and the specific needs of your family. Be prepared to discuss rules, meals, schedules, expectations, special needs, etc. We recommend that you schedule the caregiver to come to your home at least 30 minutes prior to needing care. This will give your family time to get acquainted with the caregiver, provide a tour of your home, answer any additional questions and provide rules, expectations and a list of your emergency contact information. Request our In-Home Care liability insurance when you schedule care, for your peace of mind.
Q. Can I request the same caregiver the next time I need backup care?
A. Our Backup Care Specialists will request the same caregiver as much as we can; however, this is not guaranteed due to caregiver availability, location and/or time constraints.
Q. Can my health insurance cover for the cost of home care?
A. Generally, Private pay, Medicare and Medicaid do not pay for long-term home care but long-term care insurance does cover the costs depending on what type of policy you have. We cater to the individual needs of our clients so they only pay for the services and care they require.
Q. Can I have home care in other locations aside from my home?
A. Yes, long-term care can be provided in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and retirement communities.  We also offer companionship services to clients during a hospital stay.
Q. What is In-home Respite?
A. In-home respite services consists of a caregiver who works in the family home so that the family member can leave the house for a period of time. These services are usually provided by our company. We recruit, screen, and train workers, with no contract and no long-term commitment for our clients. This type of respite is usually less disruptive to the individual needing care, provided there is a good match between the caregiver and the individual.
Q. What is an assessment of need?
A. An assessment means gathering all the relevant and vital information about you or the person receiving the care so your case is fully understood. The kind of assessment you have will depend on the informed needs. We may need to involve other people, such as your family, close family friends, or your doctor to understand your needs more thoroughly. However, we will always ask your permission before we contact them. All information is treated as confidential.
Q. Is home care only available for seniors?
A. No, home care is available to any person who requires any type of assistance from a caregiver. We provide care to people of all ages.
Q. Why should I choose home health care?
A. Home health care is another option for receiving health care services. With a private caregiver, a client can receive personalized care in a quick and effective manner. Many people also believe that returning to one’s home can sometimes speed up recovery as well as improve the quality of life for the family and the client.
