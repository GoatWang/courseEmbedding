Our expertise includes litigation related to securities, mergers and acquisitions, antitrust issues, intellectual property, and corporate governance.Mergers and AcquisitionsThe firm's China-based attorneys offer a wide array of legal services and work closely with their colleagues in the United States and Europe to leverage the firm's experience and resources on a global scale. Our fully integrated team has approximately 30 bilingual professionals, including six Greater China-based partners who are recognized experts in U.S. and Hong Kong capital markets, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate governance. Drawing on WSGR's comprehensive platform of services and expertise, our firm also represents both U.S.- and Asia-based companies and funds in corporate and venture capital investments, joint ventures, technology transactions, intellectual property matters, antitrust counseling, arbitration, and litigation.Business DisputesBusiness TransactionsBayer Cropscience AG v. Dow Agrosciences LLC —and its repeated inability to successfully challenge that award—underscores the certainty of final arbitral awards. The certainty that comes from final arbitral awards is a feature of arbitration that clients, particularly those that engage in international commercial transactions, should consider in drafting dispute resolution clauses in their agreements. The relative unlikelihood that a U.S. court would vacate an arbitral award provides enhanced certainty to the parties, as compared to court decisions, which are more likely to be modified on appeal.Trade SecretsIntellectual PropertyAntitrustCriminal LawInternet CrimesSend to PhoneRosati, Mario M, JD650 Page Mill Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304(650) 493-9300Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailRosati, Mario M, JD650 Page Mill Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94304(650) 493-9300Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
