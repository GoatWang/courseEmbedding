Is Short Haul Trucking For Me? The Owner Operator’s DilemmaEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > Is Short Haul Trucking For Me? The Owner Operator’s Dilemma








June 17, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlogLeave a comment0 

When you first considered becoming a trucker, the image that came to mind was a big tractor trailer on the open road, right?  Well, a growing percentage of trucking is moving into what is categorized as “short haul” trucking, meaning under 150 mile delivery radius.
Over the last few decades, larger carriers are introducing more depots throughout major routes giving them greater capacity and increasing the number of short haul loads between depots.  With this shift in infrastructure, opportunities abound for owner operators to cash in on a local route, allowing them to carry more loads in a week and making tractor maintenance and repairs a more consistent—and convenience—part of their calendar.
Key Advantages of Short Haul Trucking
Reduced food/travel expenses. There is a propensity to eat out more on the road, which can impact one’s health as well as the bottom line.  It takes discipline, but eating at home and bringing snacks from your local grocery store instead of a truck stop is certain to help you save money.
More loads per week. With the benefit of shorter runs and more than likely an exemption from the Hours of Service rule, it’s possible to pick up more loads in a day for the short hops
Consistent, familiar service area. Especially true when working with a single large carrier, you’ll likely inherit dedicated routes, so when detours or unscheduled back-ups (accidents, emergency maintenance) occur, you will likely be able to reroute on your own terms.
Better work-life balance. The trucking life is notorious for straining family relationships.  With long hours and unpredictable schedules, long haul trucking can be challenging for loved ones.
Versatile tractor options. With short haul trucking, you are free to use more affordable trucks since a sleeper cab is not typically required.  The shorter trips also helps justify the purchase of a used big rig instead of new, since mileage likely won’t add up as quickly.
If you’re enjoying your career as a trucker, however long for something that gets you back to your family regularly, short haul trucking just might be the right fit for you.  If you’re investigating the opportunity, be sure to take advantage of some of the benefits of short haul trucking, such as reduced trucking insurance premiums and planned fueling stops which can improve your bottom line.

How To Purchase A Big RigEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > How To Purchase A Big Rig








June 30, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlogLeave a comment0 

If you’re an established owner operator or manage a small fleet and you’re looking to purchase a new truck, you have a few options for financing a truck, however just starting out, purchasing your first truck can be difficult due to lack of established business credit.
Lets begin with financing a truck for established businesses; funding new or gently-used semi truck purchases generally fall into 3 categories: cash purchase, loan, lease.
Buy A Big Rig With Cash
Whether you’re business is thriving or it’s a capital investment from your personal account or friends & family, throwing all-cash at a depreciating asset may feel good to have it paid off, however if it leaves you cash-poor, you’re missing opportunities to grow your business in other ways, instead tying your capital up to maintain the current business size.  Even if you have a healthy bank account, maintaining that fund for a rainy day or for various growth strategies is an excellent option, while also putting a larger down payment down on your next rig.
Finance With A Semi Truck Loan
Rates are pretty favorable right now, so borrowing can be cheap and give you the cash flow flexibility you need to see a positive return on your investment.  The challenges with a loan include borrower credit (corporate credit), vehicle age and mileage, and intended purpose.  Many generalist lenders who aren’t familiar with the industry will have arbitrary rules in place for funding purchases of transportation equipment used for particular purposes.  By choosing a truck and trailer finance specialist, you’re working with a team who understands your needs, cash flow potential, and can make a better assessment and recommendations for your loan.
Lease Your New Truck and Trailer
Similar to loans, leases rely on credit ratings and the current prime rate, however generally have a lower monthly bill and have a buy-out option at the end.  The flexibility of new equipment at lower payments helps considerably during leaner times or when working capital is tied up in another venture.
Owner Operator Lease Purchase Programs
Lease Purchase Programs are a helpful tool for both new owner operators as well as recruitment tools for larger fleets to bring new drivers to drive under their brand.  A simple way of thinking of it is a new operator sub-leasing a truck from their

3 Tips for Growing BusinessesEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > 3 Tips for Growing Businesses








May 1, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlog1 Comment0 

You no doubt caught the headline and were intrigued; either searching for business growth strategies or are a regular reader of our posts.  One item to note: there is no “silver bullet” approach to business growth except through smart decisions, hard work, and a little luck.  What we’ve pulled together is a handful of tips to enhance the “smart decisions” area of your business’ growth track.
1. Know Thy Customer
Whether you’re just starting out or an established and growing business, understanding who your customer is or should be through thorough market research, and segmenting your primary market into groups of customers for targeted marketing campaigns.  Prospective customers may be segmented by demographical and geographical data points, or if you’re spanning industries, segment by industry type.
2. Seek Funding For Business Growth
In a season of growth, managing cash flow while you expand may be difficult, and “boot-strapping” the business may either make operations tight or hamper growth through available capital.  Look at the growing expenses for your business—is it general increase in overhead or new capital investments in equipment?  If the latter, work with an equipment finance company who specializes in your industry.  Consider them the experts in providing funding through equipment leases and loans designed to help your business grow, taking into account market volume and any seasonal influences.
3. Discover Ancillary Products & Services To Sell
While it’s important to keep focus on your target market, include in your growth plan the research and discovery of additional products and services that you can provide as an add-on sale to existing customers, creating additional revenue with minimal investment, and may provide a little more insulation from economic fluctuation.
BONUS: Identify and Engage New Vendors
Offering services to a larger market or territory requires additional funding, but also will often require working with bigger or a larger number of vendors to support your operations.  For a trucking business, this may mean working with multiple service yards or changing fuel card programs.  Regardless of your product or service offering, growth will create new vendor opportunities; be it volume discounts or a switch entirely.  Have this understanding going in keeps you proactive rather than reactive to the realities of supply and demand.
We’ve funded equipment loans and leases for more than 65 years, serving transportation, industrial, and construction industries with unique financing solutions driving business on the front-end, and now offering insurance and invoice factoring to support back-office needs of our customers.


 

One thought on “3 Tips for Growing Businesses”





I like what this article mentions about business growth and how it generally involves a lot of financial changes. It makes sense that a small business that experiences a lot of growth will also have a lot of financial changes that could get a lot more complicated. Having a professional financial consultant or manager could be very beneficial to ensure there aren’t mistakes made that could set the company back significantly.

How to Choose The Right Trucking CompanyEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > How to Choose The Right Trucking Company








May 31, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlogLeave a comment0 

For years you’ve been dreaming of hitting the open road, being your own boss, and making a solid living and now you’re ready.  CDL in hand, vision of launching your own trucking company, but you need to get your feet wet with a larger carrier to learn the ropes and get some revenue.  While you are picking a company to work for, the culture extends beyond the typical 9-to-5.
Get The Inside Scoop
Learning about the culture and inner workings of a company can be easier when looking at large companies, though depending on the size of your trucking driving school and past networking opportunities, it’s likely you’ll have a first or second-degree connection to a driver inside the company who should be able to give you a degree of insight into what to expect from this firm.
Do Your Homework
Review the company’s reputation, not just from what employees you know are saying, but do they have a good track record retaining drivers?  Do they offer and support opportunities for employees to become contracted Owner-Operators?  Are they equipped with any truck lease or loan programs to help drivers launch their businesses?
Other helpful information to research includes getting a read on the company’s age and financial health.  Do they have longstanding relationships and no-contest contracts with load managers and freight customers or is every load bid out through a broker or load board?
Location
Depending on your future plans, you’ll want to be sure to choose a carrier who maintains healthy operations near your preferred service area, whether it’s your home base for over-the-road trucking or local or regional freight.  If you are planning to incorporate as an Owner-Operator in the future, looking at the incorporation fees, schedule, and tax implications depending on state will be an important consideration.
Tractor Equipment Offered
As an employee or even contracted driver, you will be provided a tractor to drive, look into the track record of that equipment, in case you are required to bear the cost of any of the maintenance or should there be reliability concerns that will impact your uptime and take-home pay.
Compare With Others
It’s helpful to build a matrix of several trucking companies to help you better examine the pros and cons of each.  It’s difficult to find negatives when only examining a single firm.  By pulling in a few competitors in your evaluation, you may be surprised by the company offering the greatest career opportunity!
If your decision is still unclear after personal research, consider reaching out to a trucking industry recruiter.  They are paid by the hiring trucking company, so there is virtually no risk for the driver on the hunt.

Financing Your First Big RigEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > Financing Your First Big Rig








May 16, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlog1 Comment0 

You’re probably familiar with the process: you walk into your local car dealership, peruse the lot, and are pounced on by an eager salesperson.  After a bit of chit-chat, you take the car out for a test drive, pop the hood, and you might even do some quick research online on your phone to see if you’re getting a deal, or the right packages with the car.  A bit of haggling later, you shake hands and start signing papers.  If you’re financing the car, you can use the in-house lender or go back to your bank and get a loan for the balance less deposit and/or trade-in.  Easy, right?
Semi truck purchases are quite different from buying a sedan from your local dealer, most definitely when it comes to financing the purchase.  Big rig financing falls somewhere between a business loan and vehicle loan, and most banks don’t deal with truck loans, or aren’t equipped to appropriately determine terms and payments.  Many semi truck dealers have preferred vendors in-house who can provide funding, however you want to be sure you’re signing up with a financing company (and payment terms) that work for your business.
Choose a Truck Financing Specialist
It’s true, not every big bank in town will fund semi truck purchases, however there are a number of commercial finance companies who specialize in funding truck loans and leases.  A trucking industry loan specialist understands more about your industry than simply a credit score and asset depreciation (which are certainly important), but also is familiar with the type of equipment you’re purchases, load types, certain restrictions, and seasonal and economic influences that will impact your ability to pay.  You’re not simply choosing a truck finance company—you’re choosing a strategic financing partner for your business.
Understand Your Creditworthiness
Just like any other loan, a truck financier will look at the purchaser’s credit history and score, which will influence borrowing limit, rate, and terms on a repayment schedule.  If you walk into the lending office (or phone call) with this information, you’ll be prepared to have a more direct conversation with your potential lender, often leading to either better rates, more tailored payment schedule, or possibly both.  At the end of the day, you’re looking to be behind the wheel, hauling loads and earning money.  Picking a strategic lending partner up front can put you in the cab faster and keep you there for the road ahead.


 

One thought on “Financing Your First Big Rig”





I really like that you touch on how important it is to understand how a lender will view you. It makes sense that your credit score, history, etc. will all have an effect on how a lender views you as loan worthy. This could be particularly helpful to understand for such a large loan like for a big rig because it can be a very delicate situation.

Is Short Haul Trucking For Me? The Owner Operator’s DilemmaEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > Is Short Haul Trucking For Me? The Owner Operator’s Dilemma








June 17, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlogLeave a comment0 

When you first considered becoming a trucker, the image that came to mind was a big tractor trailer on the open road, right?  Well, a growing percentage of trucking is moving into what is categorized as “short haul” trucking, meaning under 150 mile delivery radius.
Over the last few decades, larger carriers are introducing more depots throughout major routes giving them greater capacity and increasing the number of short haul loads between depots.  With this shift in infrastructure, opportunities abound for owner operators to cash in on a local route, allowing them to carry more loads in a week and making tractor maintenance and repairs a more consistent—and convenience—part of their calendar.
Key Advantages of Short Haul Trucking
Reduced food/travel expenses. There is a propensity to eat out more on the road, which can impact one’s health as well as the bottom line.  It takes discipline, but eating at home and bringing snacks from your local grocery store instead of a truck stop is certain to help you save money.
More loads per week. With the benefit of shorter runs and more than likely an exemption from the Hours of Service rule, it’s possible to pick up more loads in a day for the short hops
Consistent, familiar service area. Especially true when working with a single large carrier, you’ll likely inherit dedicated routes, so when detours or unscheduled back-ups (accidents, emergency maintenance) occur, you will likely be able to reroute on your own terms.
Better work-life balance. The trucking life is notorious for straining family relationships.  With long hours and unpredictable schedules, long haul trucking can be challenging for loved ones.
Versatile tractor options. With short haul trucking, you are free to use more affordable trucks since a sleeper cab is not typically required.  The shorter trips also helps justify the purchase of a used big rig instead of new, since mileage likely won’t add up as quickly.
If you’re enjoying your career as a trucker, however long for something that gets you back to your family regularly, short haul trucking just might be the right fit for you.  If you’re investigating the opportunity, be sure to take advantage of some of the benefits of short haul trucking, such as reduced trucking insurance premiums and planned fueling stops which can improve your bottom line.

3 Tips for Growing BusinessesEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > 3 Tips for Growing Businesses








May 1, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlog1 Comment0 

You no doubt caught the headline and were intrigued; either searching for business growth strategies or are a regular reader of our posts.  One item to note: there is no “silver bullet” approach to business growth except through smart decisions, hard work, and a little luck.  What we’ve pulled together is a handful of tips to enhance the “smart decisions” area of your business’ growth track.
1. Know Thy Customer
Whether you’re just starting out or an established and growing business, understanding who your customer is or should be through thorough market research, and segmenting your primary market into groups of customers for targeted marketing campaigns.  Prospective customers may be segmented by demographical and geographical data points, or if you’re spanning industries, segment by industry type.
2. Seek Funding For Business Growth
In a season of growth, managing cash flow while you expand may be difficult, and “boot-strapping” the business may either make operations tight or hamper growth through available capital.  Look at the growing expenses for your business—is it general increase in overhead or new capital investments in equipment?  If the latter, work with an equipment finance company who specializes in your industry.  Consider them the experts in providing funding through equipment leases and loans designed to help your business grow, taking into account market volume and any seasonal influences.
3. Discover Ancillary Products & Services To Sell
While it’s important to keep focus on your target market, include in your growth plan the research and discovery of additional products and services that you can provide as an add-on sale to existing customers, creating additional revenue with minimal investment, and may provide a little more insulation from economic fluctuation.
BONUS: Identify and Engage New Vendors
Offering services to a larger market or territory requires additional funding, but also will often require working with bigger or a larger number of vendors to support your operations.  For a trucking business, this may mean working with multiple service yards or changing fuel card programs.  Regardless of your product or service offering, growth will create new vendor opportunities; be it volume discounts or a switch entirely.  Have this understanding going in keeps you proactive rather than reactive to the realities of supply and demand.
We’ve funded equipment loans and leases for more than 65 years, serving transportation, industrial, and construction industries with unique financing solutions driving business on the front-end, and now offering insurance and invoice factoring to support back-office needs of our customers.


 

One thought on “3 Tips for Growing Businesses”





I like what this article mentions about business growth and how it generally involves a lot of financial changes. It makes sense that a small business that experiences a lot of growth will also have a lot of financial changes that could get a lot more complicated. Having a professional financial consultant or manager could be very beneficial to ensure there aren’t mistakes made that could set the company back significantly.

Financing Your First Big RigEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > Financing Your First Big Rig








May 16, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlog1 Comment0 

You’re probably familiar with the process: you walk into your local car dealership, peruse the lot, and are pounced on by an eager salesperson.  After a bit of chit-chat, you take the car out for a test drive, pop the hood, and you might even do some quick research online on your phone to see if you’re getting a deal, or the right packages with the car.  A bit of haggling later, you shake hands and start signing papers.  If you’re financing the car, you can use the in-house lender or go back to your bank and get a loan for the balance less deposit and/or trade-in.  Easy, right?
Semi truck purchases are quite different from buying a sedan from your local dealer, most definitely when it comes to financing the purchase.  Big rig financing falls somewhere between a business loan and vehicle loan, and most banks don’t deal with truck loans, or aren’t equipped to appropriately determine terms and payments.  Many semi truck dealers have preferred vendors in-house who can provide funding, however you want to be sure you’re signing up with a financing company (and payment terms) that work for your business.
Choose a Truck Financing Specialist
It’s true, not every big bank in town will fund semi truck purchases, however there are a number of commercial finance companies who specialize in funding truck loans and leases.  A trucking industry loan specialist understands more about your industry than simply a credit score and asset depreciation (which are certainly important), but also is familiar with the type of equipment you’re purchases, load types, certain restrictions, and seasonal and economic influences that will impact your ability to pay.  You’re not simply choosing a truck finance company—you’re choosing a strategic financing partner for your business.
Understand Your Creditworthiness
Just like any other loan, a truck financier will look at the purchaser’s credit history and score, which will influence borrowing limit, rate, and terms on a repayment schedule.  If you walk into the lending office (or phone call) with this information, you’ll be prepared to have a more direct conversation with your potential lender, often leading to either better rates, more tailored payment schedule, or possibly both.  At the end of the day, you’re looking to be behind the wheel, hauling loads and earning money.  Picking a strategic lending partner up front can put you in the cab faster and keep you there for the road ahead.


 

One thought on “Financing Your First Big Rig”





I really like that you touch on how important it is to understand how a lender will view you. It makes sense that your credit score, history, etc. will all have an effect on how a lender views you as loan worthy. This could be particularly helpful to understand for such a large loan like for a big rig because it can be a very delicate situation.

How to Choose The Right Trucking CompanyEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > How to Choose The Right Trucking Company








May 31, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlogLeave a comment0 

For years you’ve been dreaming of hitting the open road, being your own boss, and making a solid living and now you’re ready.  CDL in hand, vision of launching your own trucking company, but you need to get your feet wet with a larger carrier to learn the ropes and get some revenue.  While you are picking a company to work for, the culture extends beyond the typical 9-to-5.
Get The Inside Scoop
Learning about the culture and inner workings of a company can be easier when looking at large companies, though depending on the size of your trucking driving school and past networking opportunities, it’s likely you’ll have a first or second-degree connection to a driver inside the company who should be able to give you a degree of insight into what to expect from this firm.
Do Your Homework
Review the company’s reputation, not just from what employees you know are saying, but do they have a good track record retaining drivers?  Do they offer and support opportunities for employees to become contracted Owner-Operators?  Are they equipped with any truck lease or loan programs to help drivers launch their businesses?
Other helpful information to research includes getting a read on the company’s age and financial health.  Do they have longstanding relationships and no-contest contracts with load managers and freight customers or is every load bid out through a broker or load board?
Location
Depending on your future plans, you’ll want to be sure to choose a carrier who maintains healthy operations near your preferred service area, whether it’s your home base for over-the-road trucking or local or regional freight.  If you are planning to incorporate as an Owner-Operator in the future, looking at the incorporation fees, schedule, and tax implications depending on state will be an important consideration.
Tractor Equipment Offered
As an employee or even contracted driver, you will be provided a tractor to drive, look into the track record of that equipment, in case you are required to bear the cost of any of the maintenance or should there be reliability concerns that will impact your uptime and take-home pay.
Compare With Others
It’s helpful to build a matrix of several trucking companies to help you better examine the pros and cons of each.  It’s difficult to find negatives when only examining a single firm.  By pulling in a few competitors in your evaluation, you may be surprised by the company offering the greatest career opportunity!
If your decision is still unclear after personal research, consider reaching out to a trucking industry recruiter.  They are paid by the hiring trucking company, so there is virtually no risk for the driver on the hunt.

How To Purchase A Big RigEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > How To Purchase A Big Rig








June 30, 2017 Engs Commercial FinanceBlogLeave a comment0 

If you’re an established owner operator or manage a small fleet and you’re looking to purchase a new truck, you have a few options for financing a truck, however just starting out, purchasing your first truck can be difficult due to lack of established business credit.
Lets begin with financing a truck for established businesses; funding new or gently-used semi truck purchases generally fall into 3 categories: cash purchase, loan, lease.
Buy A Big Rig With Cash
Whether you’re business is thriving or it’s a capital investment from your personal account or friends & family, throwing all-cash at a depreciating asset may feel good to have it paid off, however if it leaves you cash-poor, you’re missing opportunities to grow your business in other ways, instead tying your capital up to maintain the current business size.  Even if you have a healthy bank account, maintaining that fund for a rainy day or for various growth strategies is an excellent option, while also putting a larger down payment down on your next rig.
Finance With A Semi Truck Loan
Rates are pretty favorable right now, so borrowing can be cheap and give you the cash flow flexibility you need to see a positive return on your investment.  The challenges with a loan include borrower credit (corporate credit), vehicle age and mileage, and intended purpose.  Many generalist lenders who aren’t familiar with the industry will have arbitrary rules in place for funding purchases of transportation equipment used for particular purposes.  By choosing a truck and trailer finance specialist, you’re working with a team who understands your needs, cash flow potential, and can make a better assessment and recommendations for your loan.
Lease Your New Truck and Trailer
Similar to loans, leases rely on credit ratings and the current prime rate, however generally have a lower monthly bill and have a buy-out option at the end.  The flexibility of new equipment at lower payments helps considerably during leaner times or when working capital is tied up in another venture.
Owner Operator Lease Purchase Programs
Lease Purchase Programs are a helpful tool for both new owner operators as well as recruitment tools for larger fleets to bring new drivers to drive under their brand.  A simple way of thinking of it is a new operator sub-leasing a truck from their

Trucking Tips: Stress On The RoadEngs Commercial Finance > Blog > Trucking Tips: Stress On The Road

A commute to work can be stressful—more so if your commute is your job.  Dealing with stop-and-go traffic, unpredictable weather, irresponsible and dangerous drivers, maintenance and repair concerns, and managing a delivery schedule can compound into a nauseating career indeed.  Fortunately, you don’t face these challenges alone.  We’ve assembled a handful of tips to help you deal with common stressors as a professional trucker or delivery driver.
Enhance Your Mood With Music
Music is a powerful influencer, and not necessarily with regard to the lyrics.  The important factor to note is the style and speed of the music, as this can either hype up your anxiety or relax and soothe you.  Stanford University study (2006) shows shows that music at roughly 60 beats per minute (bpm) will allow your brainwaves to subconsciously synchronize with the music, getting you into a calming rhythm without putting you to sleep.  A simple, yet effective way to take the edge off of a stressful route.
Know Your Route
Often we’re asked to make new deliveries, sometimes in areas we’re unfamiliar with.  Take a few minutes with a map ahead of time to identify the potentially troublesome areas and make mental (or paper) notes of landmarks or cross streets leading up to an important intersection.
In the age of the smartphone and GPS, it doesn’t hurt to set up the destination in your device, but do note that sometimes road closures, construction, or redevelopment may be different than the latest map update in your device.  It doesn’t hurt to also have mental notes of roads in the region as previously mentioned.
Stay Hydrated to Combat Stress
Many of us drink coffee or tea when we get up to get a caffeine jolt, and when available, we consume various forms of caffeine throughout the day.  Instead, try starting your day with caffeine to get you moving, but shift to water or a low-calorie hydration drink.  Drinking water hydrates your organs, including the brain, helping it function optimally, which in turn, studies have shown, decreases the concentration and production of cortisol, the stress hormone.  Drinking water has numerous health benefits beyond coping with stress, and the only down side is maybe a few more pit stops along the way—a welcome break to stretch!
Picking The Right Partners
A significant stressor for any business owner is finances.  We want more than to simply keep the doors open, we want to grow and thrive.  With trucking, a sizable portion of expense goes into our equipment, and funding the purchase or lease of a new truck can be overwhelming.  Another way to beat stress as a trucker is to choose a truck and trailer financing company who knows the industry and is in your corner, providing sensible financing options that will help you acquire the equipment you need to grow your business.
