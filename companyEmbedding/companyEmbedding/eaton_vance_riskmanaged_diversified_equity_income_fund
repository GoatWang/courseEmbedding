This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Non-qualified ordinary dividen ds are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates.  Qualified dividends and capital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gains rates.

The Fund has adopted a policy to pay common shareholders a stable monthly distributi on. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, the Fund may pay distributions consisting of amounts characterized for federal income tax purposes as qualified and non-qualified ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions and nondividend d istributions, also known as return of capital. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay distributions of a particular size.
