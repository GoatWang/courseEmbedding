Target Sectors






Energy


Transport


Utilities

 
Basalt focuses on the North American and European mid market infrastructure sectors of utility, energy and transportation. Basalt is seeking low volatility assets that are either in the operational phase or in late stage construction projects that when complete exhibit traditional infrastructure characteristics. Basalt investments typically exhibit the following characteristics:
Low volatility; limited correlation with other asset classes

Operate on a largely uncorrelated cycle to other asset classes
Diversify even the most mature portfolio

Sustainable long-term, inflation-linked cash-flows

Predictable long-term cash flows; typically with government backed revenues or capacity based contracts
Stable, inflation linked revenues
Low market risk

High operating margins

Relatively low on-going variable operational and maintenance expenses

High barriers to entry

Large capital requirements limiting the number of natural competitors
Strong operational experience needed to successfully manage assets

Provision of essential services

Foundation for basic, irreplaceable public services, sometimes regulated
Benefit from relatively inelastic demand


































﻿






ESG | Basalt


































 Home / Esg
 






Basalt seeks to recognise ESG at all stages of the investment life-cycle (acquisition/management/disposal) and understand the impact that ESG has on the long term performance of portfolio investments. Basalt recognises that effective research, analysis and evaluation of ESG issues are fundamental for driving value and performance of investments over the medium and longer term.

      Basalt Infrastructure Partners II LP (“Basalt”) and its consortium 
      partner, DCO Energy (“DCO”), today announced that they have entered into 
      a definitive agreement to acquire Detroit Renewable Energy LLC (“DRE”). 
      The proposed transaction will benefit DRE’s employees, customers and the 
      broader Detroit community. Terms were not disclosed.
    

      Created in 2010, Detroit Renewable Energy is an integrated renewable 
      energy system comprised of Detroit Thermal, Detroit Renewable Power and 
      Hamtramck Energy Services. Together, these companies provide the City of 
      Detroit with safe, reliable and cost-effective solutions for clean 
      energy and waste disposal. Detroit Thermal, the City of Detroit’s 
      underground district energy steam system, has reliably heated some of 
      Detroit’s landmark buildings and businesses for more than 100 years.
    

      “Detroit Renewable Energy has played a key role in Detroit’s renaissance 
      over the past seven years. In partnership with Basalt & DCO, the company 
      will be in an even stronger position to support the City’s growth and 
      success for many years to come,” said Steve White, President of Detroit 
      Renewable Energy. “This will benefit all stakeholders as Basalt & DCO 
      possess the experience, expertise and resources to partner with the 
      community and build upon our strong record of delivering clean, reliable 
      and cost-effective renewable energy to critically-important businesses 
      across the City of Detroit.”
    

      Commenting today for Basalt, Managing Partner, Rob Gregor, said, "The 
      acquisition of DRE continues Basalt’s strategy of investing in high 
      quality, core infrastructure assets in the utility, energy, and 
      transport sectors. For DRE customers and stakeholders, it will be 
      business as usual. We will maintain the company's Detroit headquarters 
      and local management team and, as long-term investors, we are committed 
      to maintaining safe and reliable service and investing in DRE and the 
      communities it serves."
    

      Jeff Neil, who heads the North American unit for Basalt, added, "We are 
      excited by this important acquisition and committed to providing DRE 
      with the capital necessary to maintain and improve its energy 
      infrastructure. We are very pleased to be investing alongside DCO, a 
      company that brings a wealth of expertise in the operation of urban 
      district energy systems.”
    

      “DRE and its customers will benefit from the technical and financial 
      resources associated with being part of a company that is focused on the 
      district energy business” said Frank DiCola, DCO’s CEO. “The acquisition 
      is a positive development for the Detroit employees, customers and the 
      communities served by DRE,” added DiCola. “DRE customers will continue 
      to be served locally by experienced staff at the central plants, but 
      they will gain the financial support and expertise of a large, national 
      company that is focused on providing energy services.”
    

      Bracewell LLP served as Basalt’s primary legal advisor. King & Spalding 
      LLP served as primary legal advisor to DRE in this transaction.
