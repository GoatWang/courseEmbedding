Limited Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships




The partnerships that limit personal liability for business debts.


By Peri Pakroo

Limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) are both businesses with more than one owner, but unlike general partnerships, limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships offer some of their owners limited personal liability for business debts.
In limited partnerships (LPs), at least one of the owners is considered a "general" partner who makes business decisions and is personally liable for business debts. But LPs also have at least one "limited" partner who invests money in the business but has minimal control over daily business decisions and operations. The advantage for these limited partners is that they are not personally liable for business debts.
The limited liability partnership (LLP) is a similar business structure but it has no general partners. All of the owners of an LLP have limited personal liability for business debts.
In order to better understand LPs and LLPs, it's helpful to compare them to general partnerships.
What is a General Partnership?
In the business world, the word "partnership" usually refers to general partnerships. A general partnership is a business that has more than one owner and that has not filed papers with the state to create a specific entity such as a corporation or limited liability company (LLC). (To learn more about general partnerships, see Nolo's Partnerships area.)
In a general partnership:

all partners (called general partners) are personally liable for all business debts, including court judgments
each individual partner can be sued for the full amount of any business debt (though that partner can in turn sue the other partners for their share of the debt), and
each partner has "agency authority" for the partnership -- that is, each partner can bind the whole business to a contract or business deal.

How Are Limited Partnerships Different?
A limited partnership has at least one general partner and at least one limited partner. The general partner has the same role as in a general partnership: controlling the company's day-to-day operations and being personally liable for business debts.
The role of limited partners, however, differs in a few ways:

Limited partners do not play an active role in the business. The limited partners (most LPs have more than one limited partner) contribute financially to the business (for example, a limited partner might invest $100,000 in a real estate partnership) but have minimal control over business decisions or operations, and normally cannot bind the partnership to business deals.
Limited partners are not personally liable. In return for giving up management power, limited partners get the benefit of protection from personal liability. This means that a limited partner can't be forced to pay off business debts or claims with personal assets. A limited partner, however, can lose his or her financial investment in the business.
Limited partners face slightly different tax rules. For income tax purposes, limited partnerships generally are treated like general partnerships, with all partners individually reporting and paying taxes on their share of the profits each year. Limited partners, as a rule, do not have to pay self-employment taxes; because they are not active in the business, their share of partnership income is not considered "earned income" for purposes of the self-employment tax.

Limited partners need to understand that they can become personally liable if they do not stick to their passive role. If a limited partner starts taking an active role in the business, that partner's liability can become unlimited. If a creditor can prove that a limited partner took acts that led the creditor to believe that he or she was a general partner, that partner can be held fully and personally liable for the creditor's claims.
 Some states have carved out exceptions to this "active role in the business" rule. These exceptions usually allow a limited partner to vote on issues that affect the basic structure of the partnership, including the removal of general partners, terminating the partnership, amending the partnership agreement, or selling all or most of the assets of the partnership, without jeopardizing limited partner status.
Limited Liability Partnerships
Another kind of partnership, called a limited liability partnership (LLP) or sometimes called a registered limited liability partnership (RLLP), provides all of its owners with limited personal liability. LLPs are particularly well-suited to professional groups, such as lawyers and accountants. In fact, in some states LLPs are only available to professionals.
Professionals often prefer LLPs to general partnerships, corporations, or LLCs because they don't want to be personally liable for another partner's problems -- particularly those involving malpractice claims. An LLP protects each partner from debts against the partnership arising from professional malpractice lawsuits against another partner. (A partner who loses a malpractice suit for his own mistakes, however, doesn't escape liability.) Forming a corporation to protect personal assets may be too much trouble, and some states (including California) won't allow licensed professionals to form an LLC.
How to Create an LP or LLP
Creating a limited partnership or limited liability partnership is done at the state level. Each state has its own rules, but in general you must pay a fee and file papers with the state, usually a "certificate of limited partnership" or "certificate of limited liability partnership." This document is similar to the articles (or certificate) filed by a corporation or an LLC and includes information about the general and limited partners. Filing fees for LPs and LLPs are similar to those for corporations and LLCs.

Griffin, Beus & Gilbert, PLLC, Scottsdale, AZ, James Timothy Francis, James L. North, North & Associates, Birmingham, AL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.
Defendant-Appellants Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (“KKR”), Robinson Humphrey Co. (“Robinson Humphrey”) and Murray Devine & Company, Inc. (“Murray Devine”) (collectively “Appellants”) appeal the district court's order granting Plaintiff-Appellee W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. (“Huff”) leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint.   For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction.   Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.I. PROCEDURAL POSTUREHuff is an investment management company.   In 1995, Huff invested approximately $290,000,000 on behalf of its clients in subordinated notes (“Notes”) issued in connection with the leveraged recapitalization of an Alabama grocery chain, Bruno's, Inc. (“Bruno's”).  KKR engineered Bruno's recapitalization.   Robinson Humphrey issued a fairness opinion related to the recapitalization and Murray Devine issued a solvency opinion in connection with the recapitalization.   Roughly two-and-a-half years later, Bruno's filed for bankruptcy in Delaware.   On August 6, 1999, Huff filed suit in Alabama state court for fraudulent transfer, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, and conspiracy.   KKR removed the case to the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama.   In October of 1999, Bruno's bankruptcy examiner released a report, prepared for KKR in May of 1995, which cited numerous, material accounting flaws in financial statements approved by Bruno's accountants, Arthur Andersen.   As a result, on May 25, 2000, Huff filed a second amended complaint (“Second Amended Complaint”) asserting state law claims based on material misrepresentations and omissions in Bruno's public filings.   Huff brought the action as an investment advisor and attorney-in-fact on behalf of certain beneficial owners of the Notes.   Huff's federal securities fraud claims were already barred by a three year statute of repose.   See 15 U.S.C. § 78r(c).Thereafter, the Alabama bankruptcy court returned the action to Alabama state court.   Appellants removed the case to federal court on the grounds that Huff's state law claims were precluded1 by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (“SLUSA”).2  Two weeks later, in an explicit attempt to avoid SLUSA preclusion, Huff filed a third amended complaint (“Third Amended Complaint”) asserting only claims for misrepresentations made after Bruno's stock was de-listed from the NASDAQ.   Huff also dropped defendants Murray Devine and Robinson Humphrey because they were involved only in misrepresentations made prior to de-listing.   The district court did not rule on the Third Amended Complaint for three years and three months.In the interim, in light of developments in a related proceeding, Huff moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint (“Fourth Amended Complaint”).   Again, Huff acknowledged that the Fourth Amended Complaint was an attempt to avoid SLUSA preclusion.   SLUSA provides for the removal of “covered class actions.”  15 U.S.C. § 77p(c).  The term “covered class action” includes “any single lawsuit” involving “a covered security” in which “one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated.”  Id. §§ 77p(c), (f).  However, SLUSA only governs actions filed by fifty or more individually named plaintiffs.  15 U.S.C. § 77p(f)(2)(A)(i)(I).   Thus, Huff sought to substitute as plaintiffs forty-six individual Note holders.   The Fourth Amended Complaint also re-listed Murray Devine and Robinson Humphrey as defendants.On February 7, 2006, the district court denied leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint and dismissed the case with prejudice.   The district court stated that the proposed amendment:  (1) violated a prior judicial order;  (2) was untimely;  (3) was unduly burdensome on KKR;  and (4) was a waste of judicial resources.   On appeal, a prior panel of this Court vacated and remanded.   The panel rejected the reasoning of the district court but explicitly reserved judgment on whether there were alternate, legitimate reasons to deny leave to amend.   On June 22, 2007, after remand, the district court issued an order granting leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint under the liberal amendment provision in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a).   Immediately thereafter, the district court observed that SLUSA was the only asserted basis for federal jurisdiction, and SLUSA being inapplicable to the Fourth Amended Complaint, the district court remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   Appellants filed the instant appeal.In this appeal, Appellants challenge the district court's ruling granting leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint.   The amendment permitted a substitution of plaintiffs, eliminating Huff in his representative capacity and substituting therefor forty-six individual plaintiffs.   The amendment also re-listed Murray Devine and Robinson Humphrey as defendants, thus abandoning the attempt in the Third Amended Complaint to drop these two defendants.   Appellants raise several issues, including, inter alia:  (1) whether Huff is the sole real party in interest;  (2) whether Huff is an indispensable party;  (3) whether the district court erred in allowing the addition of two defendants after Huff deliberately dropped them in the proposed Third Amended Complaint;  (4) whether the statute of limitations prevents the re-listing of these defendants;  and (5) whether the district court erred in allowing the amendment because it constituted a circumvention of SLUSA.   The foregoing will be referred to in this opinion as the “merits issues.”   However, we must first determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction to entertain these merits issues.II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION“An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.”  28 U.S.C. § 1447(d).3  “The policy of Congress opposes interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed cause by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.”  Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust, 547 U.S. 633, 640, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 2152, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006).  “For over a century now, statutes have accordingly limited the power of federal appellate courts to review orders remanding cases removed by defendants from state to federal court.”  Id.  The Supreme Court has “relentlessly repeated that any remand order issued on the grounds specified in § 1447(c) is immunized from all forms of appellate review, whether or not that order might be deemed erroneous by an appellate court.”  Kircher, 547 U.S. at 640, 126 S.Ct. at 2153. Notwithstanding the force of the § 1447(d) bar, the case law has staked out limited exceptions.   Thus, we may review orders “that lead to, but are separate from, orders of remand and have a conclusive effect upon the ensuing state court action.”  Aquamar, S.A. v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., Inc., 179 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.1999).   This doctrine flows from the Supreme Court's decision in City of Waco v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 293 U.S. 140, 55 S.Ct. 6, 79 L.Ed. 244 (1934).   In Waco, the defendant impleaded a third-party and removed the case to district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.   The district court concluded that the third-party was an unnecessary and improper party and dismissed the cross-complaint.  Waco, 293 U.S. at 142, 55 S.Ct. at 7.   After the dismissal, there was no diversity between the remaining parties and the district court remanded the case to state court for lack of jurisdiction.  Id.  The defendant appealed the dismissal of the cross-complaint.   The Supreme Court recognized that no appeal lies from an order of remand.  Waco, 293 U.S. at 143, 55 S.Ct. at 7.   However, noting that “the cross-action will be no part of the case which is remanded to the state court,” the Court concluded that “[i]ndisputably [the order of dismissal] is the subject of an appeal;  and, if not reversed or set aside, is conclusive upon the petitioner.”4  Id. In this case, we can assume arguendo (but need not decide) that this appeal would satisfy Waco, because our case law also requires that the order appealed from be final under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and because we hold that the district court's order in the instant case is not final.   See Flohr v. Mackovjak, 84 F.3d 386, 390 (11th Cir.1996) (addressing a § 1447(d) issue, and after holding that Waco was satisfied, holding:  “We may thus take jurisdiction over Mackovjak's appeal, provided that the denial of his motion to substitute is a ‘final order’ within the terms of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.”);5  see also Aquamar, 179 F.3d at 1287 (holding that appealability of the district court's order that led to, but was separate from the remand order had to satisfy both the Waco doctrine and the finality rule (collateral order doctrine));  accord Price v. J & H Marsh & McLennan, Inc., 493 F.3d 55, 63 (2d Cir.2007);  Powers v. Southland Corp., 4 F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir.1993). “Section 1291 of the Judicial code generally vests courts of appeals with jurisdiction over appeals from ‘final decisions' of the district courts.”  Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U.S. 198, 203 119 S.Ct. 1915, 1919, 144 L.Ed.2d 184 (1999).   The general rule is that a district court order is considered final and appealable only if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.  Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945).   Obviously, the instant district court order does not end the litigation on the merits.   However, the Supreme Court has “interpreted the term ‘final decision’ in § 1291 to permit jurisdiction over appeals from a small category of orders that do not terminate the litigation.   That small category includes only decisions [1] that are conclusive, [2] that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and [3] that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.”  527 U.S. at 204, 119 S.Ct. at 1920 (internal citations and quotations omitted).   This three prong test is referred to as the collateral order doctrine.   The rule of finality is motivated in large part by considerations similar to those supporting the bar in § 1447(d) to review of remand orders.[T]he rule is in accordance with the sensible policy of avoiding the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise, from its initiation to entry of judgment.   The rule also serves the important purpose of promoting efficient judicial administration.Cunningham, 527 U.S. at 203-04, 119 S.Ct. at 1919-20 (internal quotations omitted).Thus, we examine whether the district court order for which Appellants seek review satisfies the collateral order doctrine.   Our analysis leads to the conclusion that the district court's order is effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment in state court.   Accordingly, the district court's order does not satisfy the third prong of the collateral order doctrine and we have no jurisdiction to review it. We begin by noting that an order permitting the substitution of plaintiffs is ordinarily interlocutory and unappealable.   See Delta Coal Program v. Libman, 743 F.2d 852, 853 (11th Cir.1984) (deciding an “interlocutory appeal to challenge the district court's ․ order allowing thirty-five individual plaintiffs to be substituted for a limited partnership”);  see also Porter v. Maule, 160 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir.1947) (concluding that an order substituting plaintiffs was “interlocutory and unappealable”).   Similarly, an order permitting or denying joinder of parties is typically interlocutory.   See United States v. Taylor, 632 F.2d 530, 531 (5th Cir. Unit A 1980)6 (citing Fowler v. Merry, 468 F.2d 242, 243 (10th Cir.1972) (“Although an order refusing or permitting the filing of an amended complaint joining an additional party is a discretionary action by the trial court and subject to appellate review as part of an ultimate final judgment, ․ the order itself is not appealable as such in isolation”)).7  The novel question we must address is whether the district court's order is effectively unreviewable in light of the remand.First, we observe that the Supreme Court has strongly endorsed the following principle, enunciated in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28(1):Although an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, relitigation of the issue in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded8 in the following circumstances:(1) The party against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law, have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action.See Kircher, 547 U.S. at 647, 126 S.Ct. at 2156-57.9  Here, Appellants cannot obtain review in federal court.  Section 1447(d) prevents this Court from reviewing the remand order itself.  Section 1291 prevents this Court from reviewing the district court's interlocutory order granting leave to amend.   This Court's prior decision in W.R. Huff Asset Management Co. v. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, 209 Fed.Appx. 931, 934 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006), did not address any of the merits issues currently before us and we do not reach the merits of those claims today.10  Accordingly, we discern no basis for the application of collateral estoppel in state court, which therefore cannot be deemed to make the order effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment in state court.Second, in light of the lack of collateral estoppel, we join the decisions of several of our sister circuits in finding no reason why the state appellate courts cannot review the propriety vel non of the district court's order on appeal from a final judgment.11  In Powers, the plaintiff filed an action in state court and the defendant removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  4 F.3d at 225.   The plaintiff then sought leave to amend the complaint to add an additional defendant under a relation back theory.   The district court granted the motion.  Id.  The amendment destroyed the court's diversity jurisdiction and the case was remanded to state court.  Id. at 226.   The Third Circuit stated:[B]ecause we are aware of no doctrine that would bar the state [appellate] court from reviewing the federal district court's interlocutory decision to allow the relation back amendment, and because we do not believe that there is a right at stake the value of which effectively will be lost if the order is not immediately appealable, we conclude that the third prong of the collateral order doctrine has not been met.Id. at 237.In Price v. J & H Marsh & McLennan, Inc., the Second Circuit reached a similar conclusion.  493 F.3d 55 (2d Cir.2007).   The plaintiff filed an action in state court and the defendant removed on the basis of diversity of citizenship.  Id. at 57.   Several years after the initial removal, the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add an additional plaintiff.  Id.  The district court granted the motion, concluded that joinder destroyed diversity, and remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Id. at 58.   Defendants appealed.   The Second Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  Id. at 63.   The court concluded that the order allowing joinder was not final under the collateral order doctrine, stating “we see no reason why the state appellate court cannot review the joinder decision on an appeal from a final judgment ․  Nor can we discern any reason to excuse Marsh from the usual requirement that it await appellate review of a final judgment to appeal the joinder ruling.”  Id.We see no reason, on the facts before us, why Appellants cannot raise in the state appellate court all the merits issues they seek to present to us in this appeal.   State courts “possess the authority, absent a provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction, to render binding judicial decisions that rest on their own interpretations of federal law.”  ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 617, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 2045, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989).   With respect to the merits issue-whether allowance of the amendment constituted a circumvention of SLUSA-the Supreme Court's Kircher opinion indicates that state courts are entirely competent to interpret and apply SLUSA.  547 U.S. at 646-48, 126 S.Ct. at 2156-57.   With respect to the other merits issues-at least some of which turned in the district court on an application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure-we note that the collateral order doctrine asks only whether an order is “effectively unreviewable.”   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure are “virtually identical.”  Ex parte Maple Chase Co., 840 So.2d 147, 150 (Ala.2002).12  In fact, “a presumption arises [in Alabama state court] that cases construing the federal rules are authority for construction of the Alabama rules.”  Id.Appellants assert that while the remand itself is not reviewable it nonetheless provides a “final judgment” sufficient to render prior orders of the district court reviewable.   In Quackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co., 517 U.S. 706, 715, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 1720, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996), the Supreme Court held that an order remanding on grounds of Burford abstention is appealable under § 1291.  “When a district court remands a case to a state court, the district court disassociates itself from the case entirely, retaining nothing of the matter on the federal court's docket.”   Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 714, 116 S.Ct. at 1719;  see also Fla. Polk County v. Prison Health Serv., Inc., 170 F.3d 1081, 1083 (11th Cir.1999) (“The district court's remand orders are final in the sense that they terminated the controversy in federal court”).   Assuming that the remand order itself is final, Appellants' argument is nonetheless unavailing.   The only issue on which the remand order is “final” is the remand itself.   As noted above, the merits issues can be reviewed in state court on appeal from final judgment.   The policy of Congress as expressed in § 1447(d), and explicitly endorsed and “relentlessly” enforced by the Supreme Court, is that litigation proceed to the merits under these circumstances.  Kircher, 547 U.S. at 640, 126 S.Ct. at 2153.   Therefore, in light of the fact that review of the district court's order granting leave to amend is available in state court, the order of remand cannot transform an otherwise interlocutory order into an appealable final order.   See Doleac ex rel. Doleac v. Michalson, 264 F.3d 470, 491 (5th Cir.2001) (“Because we do not think Congress intended the bar in § 1447(d) to turn an otherwise non-collateral, unreviewable interlocutory order into a collateral, appealable order, we conclude that this amendment does not meet the requirements of the third prong of the collateral order exception”).13 Appellants also point to the line of cases deriving from the Supreme Court's decision in Waco, which hold that the dismissal of a defendant and all the claims against it are appealable because they are no part of the case remanded to state court and if not set aside are conclusive upon the petitioner.   See, e.g., Armstrong v. Ala. Power Co., 667 F.2d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir.1982).   However, these cases are readily distinguishable.  “A partial remand of a removed action constitutes, in effect, a severance of the part that is remanded from that which is retained;  and orders entered as to the part of the action retained should be subject to the usual principles of appellate review.”   16-107 Moore's Federal Practice:  Civil § 107App.113;  see also Powers, 4 F.3d at 236-37.   Here, no severable part of the action has been dismissed.   All claims against the defendants were remanded to state court.   The substituted plaintiffs and all the defendants are before the state court.   The state courts have the competence and authority to determine if the Fourth Amended Complaint was properly allowed.14 At oral argument, Appellants expressed concern over a possible ping-pong of the case between federal and state court.   If the state court reverses the substitution order, Appellants claim they will again remove the action to federal court under 15 U.S.C. § 77p(c).  If the federal court persists in permitting substitution, the case will again be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   Appellants assert that such a vicious circle of litigation makes the substitution order effectively unreviewable.   We disagree,for nothing in [SLUSA] gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over preclusion decisions.   A covered action is removable if it is precluded, and a defendant can enlist the Federal Judiciary to decide preclusion, but a defendant can elect to leave a case where the plaintiff filed it and trust the state court (an equally competent body, see Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Fitzgerald, 160 U.S. 556, 583, 16 S.Ct. 389, 40 L.Ed. 536 (1896)) to make the preclusion determination.Kircher, 547 U.S. at 646, 126 S.Ct. at 2156.   Appellants have received an opportunity to litigate in a federal forum.   The policy of Congress is that Appellants now utilize the “equally competent” state courts to resolve the claims against them.  Id.  If the state courts determine that substitution was improper, Appellants may ask the state court to dismiss the action under SLUSA.III. CONCLUSIONIn sum, we conclude that the remand order based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction is unreviewable under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d).  The district court's order granting leave to amend to substitute as plaintiff's forty-six individual Note holders and re-list Robinson Humphrey and Murray Devine as defendants is an unappealable interlocutory order.   Appellants may seek review of all the merits issues before us in the state courts.   Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.DISMISSED.15 FOOTNOTES1.   “The preclusion provision is often called a preemption provision;  [SLUSA], however, does not itself displace state law with federal law but makes some state-law claims nonactionable through the class action device in federal as well as state court.   See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 87, 126 S.Ct. 1503, 1514, 164 L.Ed.2d 179 (2006) (‘[SLUSA] does not deny any individual plaintiff, or indeed any group of fewer than 50 plaintiffs, the right to enforce any state-law cause of action that may exist’).”  Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust, 547 U.S. 633, 637, 126 S.Ct. 2145, 2151, 165 L.Ed.2d 92 (2006).2.   SLUSA states:  “No covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any State or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any State or Federal court by any private party alleging-(1) an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security;  or (2) that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.”  15 U.S.C. § 77p(b).3.   In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the Supreme Court held that § 1447(d) applies only to remand orders made on grounds authorized in 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).  423 U.S. 336, 346, 96 S.Ct. 584, 590, 46 L.Ed.2d 542 (1976), abrogated on other grounds by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 714-15, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 1720, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996).   Two grounds for removal are listed in § 1447(c):  (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction;  and (2) a defect in the removal process.   See Snapper, Inc. v. Redan, 171 F.3d 1249, 1253-54 (11th Cir.1999).   After Huff substituted forty-six individual Note holders as plaintiffs, the district court concluded there was no basis under SLUSA for the preclusion of Huff's state law claims.   Accordingly, the court remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   As a result, § 1447(d) bars appellate review of the remand order in this case.4.   Before the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, “where an order adjudicated a separate and distinct claim ․ the judgment was final and could ‘be reviewed without awaiting the determination of the separate matter affecting only the parties to such particular controversy.’ ”   10 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 54App.101 (3d ed.2009) (quoting United States v. River Rouge Co., 269 U.S. 411, 414, 46 S.Ct. 144, 145, 70 L.Ed. 339 (1926));  see also Powers v. Southland Corp., 4 F.3d 223, 235 n. 12 (3d Cir.1993).5.   Flohr went on to hold that the appeal satisfied the finality rule because the proposed substitution of the United States for the federal employee would render the employee immune, and an order denying immunity qualifies as a collateral order satisfying the finality rule.  84 F.3d at 390.6.   In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981), this Court adopted as binding precedent decisions of the Fifth Circuit, including Unit A panel decisions of that circuit, handed down prior to October 1, 1981.   See United States v. Todd, 108 F.3d 1329, 1333 (11th Cir.1997).   Accordingly, both Porter and Taylor are binding precedent.7.   “Few problems are encountered in determining the appealability of orders dealing with party joinder.   Ordinarily orders granting or denying joinder or substitution are not final.”  15B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Jurisdiction 2d § 3914.18.8.   For purposes of clarity, we will refer to this type of preclusion as collateral estoppel in order to avoid confusion with the preclusion of certain state law claims under SLUSA.9.   Alabama state courts have also relied on the Restatement (Second) of Judgments to establish principles of collateral estoppel.   See, e.g., Lloyd Noland Found., Inc. v. HealthSouth Corp., 979 So.2d 784, 795-96 (Ala.2007) (relying on Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 26, 28(3));  Davis v. Hanson Aggregates Se., Inc., 952 So.2d 330, 339 (Ala.2006) (relying on Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27).10.   During the prior appeal, this Court considered the district court's denial of leave to amend on the grounds that the amendment:  (1) violated a prior judicial order;  (2) was untimely;  (3) was unduly burdensome on KKR;  and (4) was a waste of judicial resources.   We read our prior opinion as rejecting these, and only these, grounds for denying leave to amend.  W.R. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co. v. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, 209 Fed.Appx. 931, 934 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006).11.   Because we are addressing the question whether the district court's merits rulings are effectively reviewable on appeal from the final judgment, we need not (and we do not) express an opinion on the ability of the state trial court to consider the merits issues decided by the federal district court.   But see Kircher, 547 U.S. at 646-47, 126 S.Ct. at 2156-57.12.   Under the present circumstances, both Ala. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) state that amendment should be allowed “when justice so requires.”  Rules 15(c), 17(a), and 19 are virtually identical under both the Alabama and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.13.   Both Quackenbush and Florida Polk County are distinguishable in that in each case the remand order was not based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   In Quackenbush, the district court's “abstention-based remand order [did] not fall into either category of remand order described in § 1447(c),” 517 U.S. at 712, 116 S.Ct. at 1718, and thus § 1447(d) was inapplicable.   In Florida Polk County, the remand order was based on a forum selection clause, and did not implicate § 1447(c) or (d).  170 F.3d at 1083.   Thus, § 1447(c) and (d) were simply inapplicable, and the policy of Congress expressed through § 1447(d) was not operative in those cases.14.   In contrast, in Armstrong, the state court on remand lacked the competence to review the district court's dismissal of the United States and all the claims against it.   This was so because such review would involve the interpretation of the Suits in Admiralty Act, but that Act provided for exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts.15.   We also have no jurisdiction to rule on Appellants' Motion for Judicial Notice and Appellants' Motion to Supplement the Record on Appeal.ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:

This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand [ECF No. 14]. The motion was filed on July 2, 2014 and is ripe for review as the defendants failed to file a response. The Court finds that the defendants failed to meet their burden to remove the case, and that the case, as pled, was not properly removable. The Court therefore remands this case to state court.
PROCEDURAL POSTURE
The plaintiffs filed their original Complaint in the District Court of Denver on March 10, 2014. [ECF No. 5]. The Complaint included eight causes of action, all of which arise solely under state law. Each of the entity defendants was served with process on or about April 18, 2014. The sole individual defendant, Mr. Baugues, was served with process on May 3, 2014. The case was removed on June 2, 2014, within thirty (30) days of Mr. Baugues' having been served.1 According to the removal notice, the case was removed pursuant to diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a).
ANALYSIS
The right to remove is contingent upon the existence of original jurisdiction in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). "Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and, as such, must have a statutory basis to exercise jurisdiction." Montoya v. Chao, 296 F.3d 952, 955 (10th Cir. 2002). The party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of establishing its existence. Id. (citing Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)). As the defendants are invoking the Court's jurisdiction in this case, they "bear the burden of establishing that the requirements for the exercise of diversity jurisdiction are present." Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 251 F.3d 1284, 1290 (10th Cir. 2001). Further, "[d]efendant's right to remove and plaintiff's right to choose his forum are not on equal footing; for example, unlike the rules applied when a plaintiff has filed suit in federal court with a claim that, on its face, satisfies the jurisdictional amount, removal statutes are construed narrowly; where plaintiff and defendant clash about jurisdiction, uncertainties are resolved in favor of remand." Id. at 1289-90 (quoting Burns v. Windsor Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 1092, 1095 (11th Cir. 1994)).
Diversity jurisdiction exists where there is complete diversity between the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). None of the parties dispute that the amount in controversy far exceeds $75,000 in this case. The question is whether the defendants have carried their burden of proof that there is complete diversity between the parties. I find that they have not.
The notice of removal begins by asserting that there is complete diversity of citizenship. Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1] at Part II. In particular, Mr. Baugues states that all of the defendants are citizens of Tennessee, and that "[u]pon information and belief, the Plaintiffs are most likely citizens of the State of Colorado." Id. at ¶¶ 13, 15 (emphasis added). Mr. Baugues bases this hypothesis on the fact that Enserco Energy, LLC and Enserco Midstream, LLC have offices located in Denver, Colorado. However, "a limited liability company is a citizen of the states of which its members are citizens. . . ." Hale v. MasterSoft Int'l Pty. Ltd., 93 F.Supp.2d 1108, 1112 (D. Colo. 2000) (collecting cases). Only a corporation is deemed a citizen of the State in which it has its principal place of business. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c). Mr. Baugues also acknowledges that "it is possible that either (or both) of the Plaintiffs is a citizen of the State of Texas." Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1] at ¶ 14. Mr. Baugues once again incorrectly bases his theory of the plaintiffs' citizenship on the location of a limited liability company's principal place of business. In particular, Mr. Baugues notes that that Enserco Energy is a subsidiary of Twin Eagle Resource Management, LLC, which has its principal office in Houston, Texas. Id. Notably, Mr. Baugues fails to discuss the citizenship of the members of the plaintiff limited liability companies at any point in the notice of removal. The Court therefore has no information whatsoever with which to determine the citizenship of the plaintiffs.
Moving along, Mr. Baugues states that in the case of the four limited partnership defendants, "several of the limited partners are believed to be citizens of Texas." Id. at ¶ 16 (emphasis added).2 Mr. Baugues postulates the citizenship of the limited partners based on tax returns and other records. Affidavit of John P. Baugues, Jr. [ECF No. 1-11] ¶¶ 12, 17, 21, 25. However, there are a number of problems with this method for determining citizenship. First, it is unclear whether these addresses indicate individual residences or business addresses. Second, even if the addresses were residential, residence and citizenship are not coterminous. See Sun Printing & Publ'g Ass'n v. Edwards, 194 U.S. 377, 382 (1904). Simply being a resident of a State does not render an individual a citizen of it. Instead, to become a citizen of a State an individual must both set up a domicile in that State and intend to stay there. Id. at 383. "Either without the other is insufficient." Id. In this case, no information has been provided, nor a declaration made, that these limited partners not only reside in Texas, but also intend to remain in Texas. Furthermore, there has been no discussion of the citizenship of the other limited partners, though addresses for them have also been provided in Exhibit A to Mr. Baugues' affidavit [ECF No. 1-11 ay 6-7]. As such, the Court has no information whatsoever with which to determine the citizenship of the limited partners of the limited partnership defendants.
Each of the four limited partnership defendants also has one general partner, a limited liability company of which Mr. Baugues is the sole member. Affidavit of John P. Baugues, Jr. [ECF No. 1-11] at ¶¶ 10-11, 15-16, 19-20, 23-24. Though Mr. Baugues has not asserted that he is a citizen of any state, he has declared that he resides primarily within Tennessee and that he resides part-time in Montana. See id. at ¶¶ 6-7. Because residence and citizenship are not coterminous, the Court can only assume, without deciding, that Mr. Baugues is likely a citizen of Tennessee or Montana. However, without more information the Court cannot determine Mr. Baugues' State of citizenship.
Finally, the three limited liability company defendants—Dorchester Land Company, LLC; Dorchester Mining Company, LLC; and Dorchester Coal Processing, LLC—are all wholly owned subsidiaries of Dorchester Coal Company, LP.3 Affidavit of John P. Baugues, Jr. [ECF No. 1-11] at ¶ 13. At no point does Mr. Baugues discuss the members of these limited liability companies or their citizenship. Instead, he only notes that for each of them their principal office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee. As discussed earlier, this information is irrelevant to the Court's citizenship analysis. Once again, the Court has no information whatsoever with which to determine the citizenship of the members of the limited liability company defendants.
It is troubling, to say the least, that Mr. Baugues did not fully investigate the citizenship of the partners of the limited partnership defendants and also completely failed to investigate the citizenship of the members of the limited liability company parties before filing this notice of removal. Even more confusing is his failure to declare his own citizenship. The Court cannot assert diversity jurisdiction over an action based on mere presumptions of citizenship. Further, the Complaint itself is of no assistance. It does not list the citizenship of the members and partners of any of the entity parties or of Mr. Baugues. See Complaint [ECF No. 5] at ¶¶ 2-12. Of course, the pleading is perfectly sufficient without this information, as the plaintiffs did not file this lawsuit in federal court and, as such, did not assert diversity jurisdiction over the action.
Suffice to say, the defendants have far from carried their burden in filing this notice of removal. From what has been filed, including the Complaint, the Court has absolutely no information with which to determine the citizenship of any of the parties to this action and therefore must remand the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
The plaintiffs ask this Court to award them their costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in responding to the defendants' notice of removal. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), "[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal." In deciding whether to award costs, the Court must ask whether there was an "objectively reasonable basis" for removal. See Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132, 141 (2005). The Court finds that there was no objectively reasonable basis for removal on the face of the notice. The defendants appear to have been quite aware that there might not be diversity at the time of removal, even going so far as to ask the Court to dismiss four of the "non-essential" defendants in order to manufacture diversity. See Notice of Removal [ECF No. 1] at ¶¶ 18-20. More importantly, the defendants conducted no investigation into the citizenship of any of the parties to the action before filing their notice of removal. As such, the plaintiffs' request for costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, is granted.
The parties are to confer in good faith as to the reasonable costs and expenses. Should the parties be unable to come to an agreement as to the amount owed, the determination of the reasonableness of the costs and fees will be reserved to the state court. See Hodach v. Caremark RX, Inc., 374 F.Supp.2d 1222, 1226 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (exercising its discretion in holding that the determination as to reasonableness of cost and fees would be reserved to the state court because "litigating this case on dual tracks—the substantive issues in the Superior Court, and the ancillary costs and expenses issue in this Court—would be inefficient and would further delay the processing of the case").
ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand [ECF No. 14] is GRANTED. This case is hereby REMANDED to the state court. The plaintiffs shall be awarded their just costs and actual expenses, including attorneys' fees, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).


FootNotes 
1. Mr. Baugues serves as President of all of the entity defendants. He is also the sole member of the limited liability companies that serve as the sole general partners of the four limited liability partnerships. Affidavit of John P. Baugues, Jr. [ECF No. 1-11] at ¶¶ 8, 10-11, 15-16, 19-20, 23-24. According to the plaintiffs, these facts inevitably lead to the conclusion that Mr. Baugues was aware of the pending action and had received "constructive receipt" of it through service on the entity defendants. Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand [ECF No. 14] at 13. The plaintiffs argue that this constructive receipt renders removal untimely. Because the Court decides this motion on other grounds, it does not reach the merits of this argument.

2. For purposes of diversity citizenship, the Court must look to the citizenship of all of a limited partnership's members, including both the limited and general partners. See Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U.S. 185, 195 (1990).

3. "[W]hen an entity consists of multiple tiers of ownership and control, the entire structure must be considered for diversity purposes. In other words, when an entity is composed of multiple layers of constituent entities, the citizenship determination requires an exploration of the citizenship of the constituent entities as far down as necessary to unravel fully the citizenship of the entity before the court." Burge v. Sunrise Med. (US) LLC, No. 13-CV-02215-PAB-MEH, 2013 WL 6467994, at *2 (D. Colo. Dec. 9, 2013).

How Do I Create an LLC Subsidiary?    A limited partnership and limited liability company are both types of business entities formed under state law. They are similar in structure due to the fact that limited liability companies, or LLCs, are designed to combine the benefits of both partnerships and corporations. However, there are important differences between the two business entities.   Ready to start your LLC? Start an LLC Online Now   Personal Liability Protection An important reason why business owners form an LLC or limited partnership is to protect their personal assets from business-related liabilities. For an LLC, all the owners -- called members -- receive this liability protection. However, the owners of a limited partnership are not treated the same in this regard. A limited partnership is required to have at least one general partner and one limited partner. Although the limited partner receives liability protection, the general partner does not -- he will be personally liable for the partnership’s obligations.   Participation in Business Activity The owners of an LLC can choose to have each member participate in the management of the business or designate the management responsibilities to one manager or managers. In either case, each member receives the same liability protection regardless of his level of participation in the LLC's business activities. This is not the case with a limited partnership. In order to maintain liability protection, a limited partner cannot participate in the partnership's business activity. If such activity occurs, the limited partner may become exposed to personal liability for the partnership's obligations.   Tax Treatment The benefit of forming a limited partnership is for the pass-through tax treatment; that is the partnership is not taxed and the profits and losses of the partnership are shared among the partners and taxed only once. An LLC is similar in that it is often formed by business owners for the same tax benefit. However, for federal tax purposes, an LLC is treated as a disregarded entity. This means that, unlike a limited partnership, the members of the LLC can be choose to be taxed as a corporation rather than a partnership if that better suits the needs of the business.   Case Law Differences Limited partnerships have a much longer legal history than LLCs, with most state LLC statutes having only been enacted since the early 1990s. This creates a significant difference between the case law that has developed regarding the judicial interpretation of limited partnership law versus the development of LLC case law. Some uncertainty still exists regarding the extent to which principles of corporate law may be applied to LLCs that could impact important aspects, such as the member’s expectation of liability protection. For LLC members, such issues will not be settled until there is sufficient case law interpreting LLC statutes.
