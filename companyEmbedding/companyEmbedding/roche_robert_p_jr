EWING, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATRS) today announced the election of 
      Robert P. Roche Jr. to the Company’s Board of Directors.
    


      Mr. Roche has served as principal of Robert Roche Associates LLC, a 
      consulting firm providing guidance to the pharmaceutical and healthcare 
      industries since February 2010. From January 1995 through February of 
      2010, Mr. Roche led commercial operations at Cephalon, Inc., a global 
      biopharmaceutical company. Prior to his retirement from Cephalon, Mr.

      Pharmaceutical Operations, in which capacity he oversaw several 
      successful new product launches.
    

      Leonard S. Jacob, M.D., Ph.D., Chairman of the Board of Antares Pharma, 
      stated, “The addition of Bob Roche to our Board is welcomed and timely. 
      His background and success in commercial operations and product launches 
      will serve to complement the experienced sales and marketing team that 
      Antares has assembled. Subject to FDA approval, the Company plans to 
      launch OTREXUP™ for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis early next 
      year.”
    

      “I am excited to be joining the Board of Antares Pharma at this point in 
      the Company’s growth,” said Robert P. Roche Jr. “The Company has 
      developed a comprehensive commercialization plan for OTREXUP™ which I am 
      confident will result in a well-coordinated launch early next year. The 
      launch plan will also serve as a template for other drug-device 
      combination products in their pipeline, such as QS T for Testosterone 
      Replacement Therapy,” added Mr. Roche.
    

      Mr. Roche was elected unanimously by the Company’s Board of Directors at 
      the recommendation of the Nomination and Governance Committee. Before 
      joining Cephalon, Mr. Roche served as Director and Vice President, 
      Worldwide Strategic Product Development for SmithKline Beecham’s central 
      nervous system and gastrointestinal products business. Prior to that, he 
      held senior marketing positions in Canada and Spain and had product 
      planning responsibilities for SmithKline in Latin America. Mr. Roche 
      began his pharmaceutical career in 1982 with SmithKline & French as a 
      U.S. Pharmaceutical sales representative. He is a graduate of Colgate 
      University and earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University 
      of Pennsylvania.
    

      Paul K. Wotton, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I 
      am pleased to have someone with Bob’s wide ranging experience join our 
      Board. Bob’s track record of success speaks for itself, his extensive 
      commercial and product launch experience will be invaluable as we 
      continue to execute against our strategic plan and complete our 
      transition to a specialty pharmaceutical company.”
