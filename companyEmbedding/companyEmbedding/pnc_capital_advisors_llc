Important Legal Disclosures and Information




Offers are available from participating merchants. Your personal banking information is not shared with the merchants participating in PNC Purchase Payback. Whether you receive offers may depend on using your PNC Visa Card, or where you use your PNC Visa card to make purchases. Not everyone will get the same offer.


In order to qualify for a Relationship Rate for Premiere Money Market, you must have a linked checking account (for the Performance Checking Relationship Rate, you must have a linked Performance Checking or Virtual Wallet® with Performance Spend; for the Performance Select Checking Relationship Rate, you must have a linked Performance Select Checking or Virtual Wallet with Performance Select) and meet one of the following requirements:

Make a combination of 5 or more PIN and/or signature point-of-sale transactions (excluding cash advances) posted during the previous calendar month to your Checking account using your Visa® Debit Card or to your linked Visa Credit Card.
Have $2,000 in qualifying direct deposits ($1,000 for WorkPlace or Military Banking customers) in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend or Performance Checking during the previous calendar month.
Have $5,000 in qualifying direct deposits in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Select or Performance Select Checking during the previous calendar month.

(A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement.)
Starting with the calendar month following when you open your Premiere Money Market account, and monthly thereafter, whether the account earns the variable Standard or Relationship Rate for the entire calendar month will be determined on the first of the month based upon the number of qualifying transactions or direct deposit requirement from the previous calendar month.

If there are changes to your linked checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Premiere Money Market account), you may no longer qualify for a Relationship Rate, or the rates may otherwise change to those in effect at the time of the change.


In order to qualify for the Relationship Rate for Standard Savings, you must have a linked Standard Checking, Performance Checking, Virtual Wallet® with Performance Spend, Performance Select Checking or Virtual Wallet with Performance Select and meet any one of the following requirements:

Make a combination of 5 or more PIN and/or signature point-of-sale transactions (excluding cash advances) posted during the previous calendar month to your Checking account using your Visa® Debit Card or to your linked Visa Credit Card.
Have $500 in qualifying direct deposits in a linked Standard Checking during the previous calendar month.
Have $2,000 in qualifying direct deposits ($1,000 for WorkPlace or Military Banking customers) in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend or a Performance Checking during the previous calendar month.
Have $5,000 in qualifying direct deposits in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Select or a Performance Select Checking during the previous calendar month.

(A qualifying debit card purchase is defined as any debit card purchase made at point of sale using your signature PIN, or a purchase made electronically or online using your debit card number, inlcuding recurring payments.)
 
Starting with the calendar month following when you open your Standard Savings account, and monthly thereafter, whether the account earns the variable Standard or Relationship Rate for the entire calendar month will be determined on the first of the month based upon the number of qualifying transactions or direct deposit requirement from the previous calendar month.

If you or we make changes to your linked checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Standard Savings account), you may no longer qualify for a Relationship Rate.


A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement.


PNC deposit accounts include consumer checking, savings, money market, certificate of deposit, and retirement certificate of deposit. PNC loan accounts include line of credit, auto or home equity installment loan, and mortgage loan. PNC linked investment balances include investment balances from a PNC Investments account including the value of any annuities if they are reflected on the PNC Investments account statement. Some accounts may not be eligible to be included in the combined average monthly balance requirement based on titling structure, product type or other constraints. A maximum of ten (10) linked PNC accounts, including this account, may be included in the combined average monthly balance relationship. Customer must request account be linked to receive relationship benefits. The outstanding balance on lines of credit, and the original principal amount on installment and mortgage loans, will be used to determine the combined average monthly balance.

Manage Your Financial Life
Life doesn't get any less complicated — especially when it comes to your money. Virtual Wallet gives you one clear picture of your money, so you can understand it, stay in control, plan for the future and reach your goals.
















Take A Fresh Look at Your Money
Virtual Wallet's unique online and mobile features give you an instant snapshot of your situation, so you can better understand your money.

Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger Day℠

See Everything in One Place
Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger Day℠
Calendar
This is not your average calendar, it's your bill payment hub. You'll see everything in one place on a calendar view — your upcoming payday, what you're spending and when you spent it, your scheduled bill reminders and your upcoming payments. You can also see any impending Danger Day℠ and use Online Bill Pay, which means worrying less and making sure late payments don't happen again. Feeling better already, aren't you?
Bill Pay
Gone are the days of worrying about every bill and due date. With PNC Online Bill Pay, we'll help you stay on track. Bills are integrated with the Money Bar® and the Calendar, so you know how much money is set aside and when it's on the way out. You can schedule payments whenever you need to — or set up recurring, automatic payments for even less worry. And while the Calendar is one way to remind yourself of your obligations, we can also send you emails about upcoming due dates to keep you on top of things. You have enough deadlines. Go ahead and cross this one off.
Danger Day
We've all had those weeks when the bills outweigh the paychecks and due dates loom. Enter Danger Day. Color-coded in red (so you won't miss it), it shows up on your Calendar when your Spend account is at risk of being overdrawn. This way, you can keep ahead by moving money from Reserve or changing the day a bill is paid. Stay on time, every time.
Images for illustrative purposes only.





Next Feature: Money Bar






Money Bar®

Move Money Easily
Money Bar®
Get a bird's eye view of what your money's up to. The Money Bar puts it into three categories: Scheduled Out (the money allocated for bills and other payments), Free (money that's available to spend), and Reserve (the money you've tucked away). It's our way of making everything clearer.
Once you've got a good idea of where everything is, you can make adjustments. Need extra money for date night? Got a little left over you want to put toward that vacation? Using the Slider, you can move money back and forth between Spend and Reserve with no effort. Managing your funds is literally in your hands.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger DayNext Feature: Wish List





Wish List

Set Goals and Reach Them
Wish List

What's the point of working hard if you're not treating yourself once in a while, right? The Wish List is where you'll set sights on the things you want and start saving. You can put money toward each item in your Reserve account, keep track of your progress, and transfer money to Spend when you've reached your goal. And you can give certain items priority. So, if you really need a new fridge before that trip to Bora Bora, you can put money where it's needed.
And while we're on the subject, don't forget Reserve Items. They let you set aside money for future expenses and get a reminder on your Calendar.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Money BarNext Feature: Spending Zone





Spending + Budgets

Track Your Spending
Spending + Budgets

It's easy for money to fly out the door, especially when you're having fun. Spending + Budget's tools provide a simple way to see what you're spending your money on each month - and get a hold on it. Broken down into categories like Education, Restaurants, Gas and more, it allows you to set a budget for each. You can also set up to get handy reminder emails if you're close to maxing out your budget for any category. That way, you can hit the brakes before going over the edge.
Images for illustrative purposes only.




Previous Feature: Wish ListNext Feature: Savings Engine





Savings Engine®

Save Without Even Thinking About It
Savings Engine®

You can't always think about saving, especially when you're too busy spending. That's why we built the Savings Engine. It gives you three easy ways to put cash aside — even when saving is not exactly top-of-mind. With the Payday Savings rule, a predetermined amount will automatically transfer from Spend to Growth on days you've designated as pay days. Bill Pay makes it easy to transfer money to Growth whenever you pay a bill online from your Calendar. Punch the Pig® is an on-the-fly way to add money to Growth while you're banking online.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Spending ZoneNext Feature: Punch the Pig





Punch the Pig®

Saving Made Fun
Punch the Pig®

The only thing more rewarding than saving money is having a little fun doing it. That's the idea with Punch the Pig. When you're banking online, just "punch" the piggy bank and money (the amount of your choice) will transfer from your Spend account to your Growth account. (That "punch" is a "shake" for smartphone users.) Go ahead. You know you want to.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Savings EngineNext Feature: Mobile





Mobile

Master Your Money Wherever You Are
Mobile Banking

With Virtual Wallet, your bank is only as far away as your mobile device. You can bank when and where you want with the Virtual Wallet Insider app. You can use your iPhone®, Android™ or other supported mobile device, including tablets.
Our new app, Virtual Wallet Insider, offers you all the same major features found on desktop combined with exclusively mobile tools like mobile deposit and Money Bar Preview.

Putting It All Together
Credit Card

Include your current PNC credit card in your Virtual Wallet and experience helpful features such as:

Calendar - View your credit card balance alongside your Spend account balance as well as past charges on your credit card, payments to your card, when your payments are due and when your next statement is created
Spending + Budgets - See your credit card transactions automatically sorted in to different categories to help you better understand and track your spending
Mobile - Manage your credit card on the go with our Virtual Wallet app[1]

Previous Feature: Mobile












Spend, Save and Grow
Virtual Wallet is comprised of three distinct accounts, working together as one seamless, online money management tool.



SPEND is your primary checking account.
It's designed for your everyday spending. Debit card purchases are deducted from your Spend (you can withdraw money at ATMs from any of your accounts). You’ll use Spend to pay bills by check or through Online Bill Pay. It also works in harmony with your Reserve.



GROWTH is your long-term savings account.
It functions as your secondary Overdraft Protection. The competitive interest rate[2] makes it perfect for you to build your nest egg and grow financially. Put money into your Growth to save up for life-changing purchases ahead - a car, a down payment on a house, or even a dream vacation.
 



RESERVE is your short-term savings account.
It functions as your primary Overdraft Protection — so if you're at risk of overdrawing your Spend account, money can be automatically transferred from your Reserve to your Spend at no charge. Utilize your Reserve to set aside money for upcoming expenses.



Add a PNC Credit Card.
Rewards, cash back or low interest...no matter what you are looking for in a credit card, we've got you covered. Add your PNC credit card to your Virtual Wallet to receive the same money management tools and view of your spending.
