Ronald L. Chez, a Private Investor, Files an Amended 13D for Repligen

CHICAGO, Aug. 15, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Ronald L. Chez, a private investor, files an amended 13D for Repligen and sent the following letter to the Board of Directors:
Dear Board of Directors: Attention Karen Dawes and Walter Herlihy
As you know, I have been a Repligen investor for many years.  I have respected and valued the leadership efforts of Walter Herlihy. However, failed efforts, the financial results of the Company and the Company's market performance have caused me to consult with other key investors in Repligen, as I indicated I would in my recent SEC filing. 
As a result, I have discussed Repligen with the holders of a significant percentage of the Repligen outstanding stock.  We are, and have been, long-term shareholders, and, I believe, very patient. As investors, we have attempted on many occasions to constructively engage management with our views on the Company and the opportunities available to improve the value of the Company for all shareholders. Unfortunately, despite everyone's best intent, these efforts have not delivered the results that, we or you would have anticipated, and we have a right to expect. The reality is that Repligen stock is trading at approximately the same price as it was five years ago.  After my discussions with Repligen's larger shareholders, we have a few suggestions that we believe can and should be acted on promptly by the Board to help improve market perception of Repligen and enhance the Company's value for its shareholders.
First, the Board should immediately implement a policy that requires Repligen's directors and officers to be stockholders in the company.  This will, I believe, more closely align the interests of Repligen's officers and directors with its investors.   As investors, I and other shareholders expect Repligen's officers and directors to be invested with their own 'hard' money in Repligen stock, not just options. I call on the Board to enact Compensation and Governance standards for stock ownership for itself and the officers of the Company. These standards would be separate from the many grants of options to purchase stock at some future date that are currently held. As an aside, Walter Herlihy's actual ownership of stock is consistent with my minimum expectations.  There are many existing plans dealing with stock ownership for directors and officers that can serve as a guide to the implementation of a suitable plan for the Company. 
Additionally, the Board should rescind the Rights Agreement dated March 3, 2003 (the so-called 'poison pill'). Whatever the market conditions and management concerns were in early 2003 that caused the Board, at that time, to approve a poison pill those issues are not relevant now. As every investor knows, the Rights Agreement creates the impression to the market of entrenching management and the Board of Directors. Whatever the good intentions might have been in 2003, the existence of the Rights Agreement makes the Company a materially less attractive investment in today's marketplace, especially to institutional investors. The other major investors I have spoken with agree conceptually with the aforesaid.
Finally, the Board should retain a qualified investment banker to assist in evaluating the actions that are most likely to enhance shareholder value. I have had discussions with qualified investment bankers that the Board may wish to consider; as we have spent time analyzing and discussing Repligen's opportunities. I believe there needs to be a careful analysis of risk and reward regarding the highest and best use of the Company's assets. For example, the bioprocessing assets may be more effectively monetized by another enterprise with a better sales infrastructure than that which currently exists at Repligen. The fact that the Company owns bioprocessing assets should not require the Company to build overhead and organization, unless the Board determines that the use of Repligen resources for that purpose is the best path to enhance shareholder value (which I would doubt). The same critical review should apply to realizing value for RG1068.  The investors I talked with and I agree, however, with Repligen's plan to seek partners for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (RG3039) and Freidreich's Ataxia (RG2833).
I wish to personally pursue a constructive discussion directly with the Board regarding the matters discussed in this letter, including various strategic alternatives that I believe are available to the Company. I am available to meet in person or by telephone as soon as possible.
Sincerely,
Ronald L. Chez
Office: 312-944-0987

Annex A
Ronald Chez1524 N. Astor St.Chicago, IL 60610
Repligen CorporationAttn: Karen Dawes41 Seyon StreetBuilding #1, Suite 100Waltham, MA 024531/24/12
Karen - As you know, I have discussed with you and Walter a significant checklist of issues that deal with Repligen (Nasdaq:   RGEN) strategic and operating issues. 
These issues, if handled correctly, have the potential to positively impact shareholder value, which is certainly long overdue. I have reviewed my concerns with significant Repligen shareholders over the past several months, and these owners of Repligen have provided ideas and constructive debate in an effort to help achieve a more positive return on our investment. 
There is one point that these shareholder's and I can readily agree on: we are all very dissatisfied with the performance of our stock. Rather than enumerating my concerns in this letter, and rather than just talking with you and Walter (thank you for the time), I would like to request a meeting with the entire Board at the earliest possible time. I have important concerns that need to be dealt with now. I believe it is imperative to better align the interests of the Board and senior management with the owners of the company. As you are aware, I have ideas as to how this can be accomplished.
In previous months, I have asked you to consider retaining an investment banker to provide objective, dispassionate commentary dealing with strategic alternatives that the entire Board should evaluate. I have provided you with the names of bankers who have experience and knowledge relevant to Repligen, and nothing has happened to the best of my knowledge. 
In addition to large shareholders, I have been reviewing alternatives with investment bankers. I would like to have one of these bankers join me to meet with the Board to consider a full range of actions on behalf of long term, unrewarded investors. 
Our stock has recently traded at about $3.50, the approximate price of five years ago, and 10 years as well. Our company needs, now, to improve on this obviously lackluster performance. "When all is said and done" too much has been said without positive results, and much too little has been done. 
Karen, if you would provide me with a time(s) when a meeting with the Board can be held; and please assure me that each member of the Board will receive my letter.

Center for Wounded Veterans Dedication» more
Photo by: Robin Scholz
Dedication ceremony for the Center for Wounded Veterans in Higher Education on UI campus in Urbana on Friday, October 2, 2015.










 

URBANA — Ron Chez knows a wise investment when he sees one.
A successful financial management consultant with his own corporation, the University of Illinois graduate has advised a who's who of the Fortune 500 — from JP Morgan Chase and Motorola to Apple and Amazon.
But one of his latest investments is in people.
"It's an obligation. I feel like it's an obligation," Chez said of his $6 million donation that covered nearly half the cost of building the Center for Wounded Veterans in Higher Education at his alma mater. "I always said, 'If I was blessed with the opportunity, if I could, I would do things to benefit others.' I didn't come from a wealthy family at all, at all.
"There's nothing more important than providing services to the people who defend the country and put themselves at great risk."
A Chicago-area native, Chez enrolled at the UI in the late '60s as a physical education major on a baseball scholarship.
"I played for a bit, and I became a has-been," said Chez, who switched his major to political science, and in 1969, graduated Phi Beta Kappa in what he describes as "a giant upset."
On a visit back to campus years later, Chez remembers looking for his name on the Bronze Tablets, the list of graduates who earned University Honors, and discovering his was the only one out of order — not in a column, separate from the others.
"The only one, and it looks like I snuck in there and put my name up there," he said, laughing. "I thought it was extraordinarily humorous."
After the UI, Chez enrolled, on scholarship, to Northwestern University's law school.
"I went for three days, and that was sufficient," said Chez, who, signed up for the Army shortly thereafter.
"It was at a time when hardly anybody was shooting anybody, so that was a blessing," he said.
After the military, he started his own business in 1979, focusing on consulting and venture capital, generally involving the stock market and private deals.
Today, he's the president and sole owner of Ronald L. Chez Inc., a financial management consulting corporation. He is also the chairman of the board of Epiworks, a compound semiconductor materials company in Champaign.
But he has a fun side, too.
He's the executive producer of Woody Allen's recent movies, like "Magic in the Moonlight" and another that's being shot this year and stars Steve Carell, among other Hollywood notables.
"We are friends, yes," Chez said of Allen. "But I don't do anything really but pay for the movie with another person. He doesn't give scripts out."
Chez said it's not his best use of money and admits he wouldn't invest in anyone else's movies.
"It's just my regard for his special genius, so I did it because it's so wildly different from other stuff I do," he said. "It's fun to do it, and there is a reasonable probability that I would not lose money."
On the philanthropic side, he's a member of the Wounded Warriors board and formed the Chez Family Foundation. The latter funds the Chez Scholars program, which pays the full college freight of academically gifted but economically disadvantaged Chicago Public Schools graduates.
In its eighth year at the UI, the program has funded about 40 students.
"It's a stunning record of performance by these young people," Chez said.
The idea behind the wounded veteran center donation came after Chez read an article about the UI's Beckwith Hall, a residence center for students with disabilities, and asked for a tour on visit to campus.
Tanya Gallagher, the dean of the UI College of Applied Health Sciences, was his tour guide. She mentioned plans for her big idea — to build a one-of-a-kind one-stop-shop for disabled veterans attending school here.
"Almost immediately, he said, 'I want to help with that,'" Gallagher said.
Chez's $6 million pledge was the lead gift in the fundraising project, "which was instrumental in moving the project forward," Gallagher said. "Actually, essential."
"She pursued it vigorously," Chez said. "Loads of people have ideas, but she had a concept and made it happen. It's the people who come up with the idea and then doggedly pursue it. So they're the ones who deserve great credit here."

A more effective gift would be for scholarships.  Last thing UIUC needs is another building.   But hey, if you want a monument to yourself, building it is.  
ACES has a tradition of bricks trumping students or faculty support.

I would invite you to stop by the Center for Wounded Veterans. The wrap-around services that are provided by the center provide a truly unique and critical service for our student veterans at UIUC.
To clarify, the Center is under the College of Applied Health Sciences.

OK, College of Applied Health Studies.
But the rest of your response is hogwash.  
Want to help students?  Give fellowships or scholarships.  
Want to help the units? Give a professorship.
Want to prop up your ego, erect a building.
