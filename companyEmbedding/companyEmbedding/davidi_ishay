David A. Ishay | Founder of The Ishay Group


David A. Ishay, founder of The Ishay Group, a Brooklyn NY native since 1972, has founded, owned and operated businesses ranging from manufacturing, retail, marketing and sales, advertising, publishing, mail order, e-commerce, (all under the brands of American Spirit, You Sport, and YRB). All the while, Mr. Ishay has invested in Real Estate. In the process, he has briefly operated a French Bistro (La Barrique), ostensibly to improve the tenant positioning of the Bryant Park office building. Presently, Mr. Ishay is solely committed to managing and developing properties.
Mr. Ishay has owned and managed THE MODERN ARTS building, a NYC office building (38 West 39 St., Bryant Park area) since 1999, and is currently planning an extension and addition to the property to optimize and tap into its air rights potential. Currently, David Ishay is involved in multiple development projects ranging from ground up construction, conversion, rehab, extensions and additions on multiple properties simultaneously. The following projects are all expected to be completed in 2019:

Manhattan – Bryant Park: office building (extension and addition)
Brooklyn – PLS, (Prospect Lefferts South): 67 apartment units (ground up construction)
Jersey City – The Heights: 14 apartments and retail (conversion)
Newark: 216 apartments (rehab)
