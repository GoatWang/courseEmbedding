Where We Operate | Extraction Oil & Gas






































 
























Where We Operate








Wattenberg Field
      	Extraction Oil & Gas operates in the Greater Wattenberg Field of Colorado’s Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin, targeting development of the Codell and Niobrara formations.
The Wattenberg Field, discovered in 1970, was historically a major gas field. It produced over 4.0 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas from the J Sand, Codell, and Niobrara formations from nearly 20,000 wells.
In 2009, operators began experimenting with multi-stage horizontal completion techniques in the Niobrara Chalks. The early results were significant and the development of the field immediately began to evolve from vertical infill drilling to a horizontal resource play. Operators have now had outstanding results in the Niobrara A, B and C benches as well as the Codell Sandstone. Extraction is focused on the western portion of the field where both the Niobrara and Codell are prospective.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.20      Net Money Flow ($)  124,415    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

The registration statement may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov under the registrant's name, "Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc." This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent Extraction's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, and it is possible that the results described in this press release will not be achieved. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of Extraction's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as required by law, Extraction does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Extraction to predict all such factors. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in the prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with our initial public offering. The risk factors and other factors noted in our prospectus could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Read MoreExtraction Oil & Gas LogoMoreLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160928/413160LOGO  To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/extraction-oil--gas-inc-announces-launch-of-initial-public-offering-300336416.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDropbox Likely to Hire Goldman Sachs for Possible IPOBloombergThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredExclusive: Saudi Aramco advisers favor London for historic IPO - sourcesReutersThere's an eye-popping alternative to overheated tech stocksBusiness InsiderWhat you need to know on Wall Street todayBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe High Times was founded in 1974, so yes, that means you've missed their 420th issue.The StreetTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredTODAY'S CHARTS: Don't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3Yahoo FinanceWhy Apple is discontinuing these iPodsYahoo Finance VideoStocks whiff as earnings and economic data pour inYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceAnthony Scaramucci Boasted Trump Could Sink 3-foot Golf Putts, the White House Says It’s 30ThomasW: What a piece of work this boss bottom-kisser is.
