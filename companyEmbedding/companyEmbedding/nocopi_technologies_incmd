 Patented Rub & Reveal ink is the best security ink Nocopi has ever developed. It's simple to use, almost impossible to replicate, and affordable.                                            What more can you ask for?

Since its development this amazing patented ink has 
                                              been used to protect all kinds of documents: from                                              receipt rolls to casino tickets to price tags, to                                              coupons, to prescription pads. Basically any paperbased                                              document can be secured using this versatile                                              ink. The ink is designed to be printed using flexo                                              presses.

The versatility of Rub & Reveal allows you                                              to print almost any image on the front or                                              back of bond and thermal papers. Use it                                              on any paper based document to protect it                                              from being counterfeited. 






                                        Use Rub & Reveal to print                                        logos, return policies, and                                        other images. Nocopi offers                                        a number of color options 
                                        for both the top and bottom                                        color.






 
                                        To authenticate document,
                                        simply rub or scratch Rub 
                                        & Reveal to expose the
                                        bottom color. 






                                        A chemical pen can offer a secondary check for Rub & Reveal inks. It changes the bottom color to a different color from the one that is scratched.







                                        Use Rub & Reveal
                                        for price tags, coupons,
                                        tickets, and
                                        other value-based
                                        documents.

	NOCOPI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.









	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)







	Note 1. Financial Statements






	The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by Nocopi Technologies, Inc. (the Company). These statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which management believes necessary for a fair presentation of the statements and have been prepared on a consistent basis using the accounting policies described in the summary of Accounting Policies included in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the accompanying disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The Notes to Financial Statements included in the 2016 Annual Report on Form10-K should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interim financial statements. The interim operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 may not be necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the full year.





	The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220 in reporting comprehensive income.  Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income.  Since the Company has no items of other comprehensive income, comprehensive income is equal to net income.






	Note 2. Going Concern






	Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and, as of March 31, 2017, had accumulated losses of $13,148,200. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had net income from operations of $60,200. At March 31, 2017, the Company had negative working capital of $103,100 and a stockholders deficiency of $122,400. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Companys net income from operations was $271,800. The Company, which is substantially dependent on its licensees to generate licensing revenues, may incur operating losses and experience negative cash flow in the future. Sustaining profitability and positive cash flow depends on the Companys ability to maintain the increases in revenues and gross profits that it realized in 2016 from its traditional business. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate sufficient revenues and gross profits to sustain profitability and positive cash flow in the future.





	Receipt of funds in earlier periods from investors and from demand loan holders have allowed the Company to remain in operation through the current date. Management of the Company believes that it may need additional capital in the future both to fund investments that may be needed to maintain operating revenues at levels that will sustain its operations and maintain the levels of operating income and positive cash flow achieved during 2016. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient additional capital, or if it does, that the additional capital will enable the Company to impact its revenues so as to have a material positive effect on the Companys operations and cash flow. The Company believes that without additional capital, whether in the form of debt, equity or both, it may be not be able to satisfy its debts as they become due.





	The above mentioned factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.






	Note 3.  Stock Based Compensation






	The Company follows FASB ASC 718,

	Compensation  Stock Compensation

	, and uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of an award. At March 31, 2017, the Company did not have an active stock option plan. There was no unrecognized portion of expense related to stock option grants at March 31, 2017.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)










	Note 4. Demand Loans






	At March 31, 2017, the Company had a $10,000 unsecured loan from one individual outstanding. The loan bears interest at 8%. During the first three months of 2016, the Company repaid $4,000 of the unsecured loans.






	Note 5. Convertible Debentures






	At March 31, 2017, the Company had convertible debentures totaling $128,300 outstanding, of which $95,000 are due during the third quarter of 2017 and $33,300 are due during the third quarter of 2018. The convertible debentures bear interest at 7%. At the option of the lender, the debentures and accrued interest are convertible in whole or part into common stock of the Company at $0.025 per share. During the first quarter of 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved and the holders of $33,300 of convertible debentures that had matured during the third quarter of 2016, one of which is held by a Director of the Company, accepted an offer of extension whereby the maturity dates of the convertible debentures are extended for two years and the conversion rate of the debentures and accrued interest into Common Stock of the Company is reduced from $0.05 to $0.025. In accordance with FASB ASC 470, this modification of the convertible debentures was recorded as a debt discount to the notes payable of approximately $13,200 with an offsetting credit to additional-paid in capital. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, the entire $13,200 was accreted through interest expense.





	The Company in 2012 and 2013 also granted warrants to purchase 691,365 shares of the Companys common stock at $0.02 per share to the holders of the debentures. The warrants are exercisable two years after issuance and expire seven years after issuance. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The relative fair value of the warrants was recorded as a discount to the notes payable with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital since the Company determined that the warrants were an equity instrument in accordance with FASB ASC 815. The debt discount related to the warrant issuances was accreted through interest expense over the original term of the notes payable. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, $0 and approximately $200, respectively, was accreted through interest expense.

Also included in other income (expenses) is accretion of debt discounts in the three months ended March 31, 2017 related to the extension of the maturity dates of $33,300 of convertible debentures.






	Note 7. Income Taxes






	There is no provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has established a valuation allowance for the entire amount of benefits resulting from the Companys net operating loss carryforwards because the Company has determined that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is not assured.





	There was no change in unrecognized tax benefits during the period ended March 31, 2017 and there was no accrual for uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2017.





	Tax years from 2012 through 2016 remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.






	Note 8. Related Party Transactions






	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016 the Company paid $95,500 and $15,000, respectively, to Michael A. Feinstein, M.D., the Companys Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, representing a portion of previously deferred salary owed to him under an employment agreement with the Company. During each of the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, Dr. Feinstein deferred $21,250 of salary. At March 31, 2017, Dr. Feinstein was owed approximately $227,000 of salary deferred by him. There is no interest payable on the deferred salary.






	Note 9. Earnings (Loss) per Share






	In accordance with FASB ASC 260,

	Earnings per Share

	, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed using net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per common share involves the assumption that outstanding common shares are increased by shares issuable upon exercise of those warrants for which the market price exceeds the exercise price. The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such warrants is decreased by shares that could have been purchased by the Company with related proceeds. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, the number of incremental common shares resulting from the assumed conversion of warrants was 157,007 and 1,143, respectively.

	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations









	Forward-Looking Information







	This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), regarding, among other things, anticipated improvements in operations, the Companys plans, earnings, cash flow and expense estimates, strategies and prospects, both business and financial. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, will, may, intend, estimate, potential, continue and similar expressions, as they relate to the Company, are intended to identify, where possible, forward-looking statements.






	The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events, financial trends, market opportunities, competition, and the adequacy of the Companys available cash resources, which the Company believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. This Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements attributed to third parties. All such statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, including, without limitation, with respect to risks, uncertainties, anticipated operating efficiencies, new business prospects and the rate of expense increases. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, and because of the uncertainty relating to the current financial conditions in todays economic environment and the potential reduction in demand for the Companys products, you should not consider this information to be a guarantee by the Company or any other person that its objectives and plans will be achieved. When you consider these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the Risk Factors and other cautionary statements set forth in this Item 2 and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.





	The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report as well as with the Companys audited Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on March 30, 2017 and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information.






	Results of Operations






	The Companys revenues are derived from (i) royalties paid by licensees of the Companys technologies, (ii) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and (iii) the direct sale of (a) products incorporating the Companys technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and (b) equipment used to support the application of the Companys technologies, such as ink-jet printing systems. Royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by the Companys licensees and/or additional royalties, which typically vary with the licensees sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology. Technical services, in the form of on-site or telephone consultations by members of the Companys technical staff, may be offered to licensees of the Companys technologies. The consulting fees are billed at agreed upon per diem or hourly rates at the time the services are rendered. Service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided.





	The Company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows:





	a) License fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins. Upon inception of the license term, revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process, which generally is ratably over the license term;





	b) Product sales are recognized upon shipment of products, when the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured; and





	c) Fees for technical services are recognized when (i) the service has been rendered; (ii) an arrangement exists; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.









	8







	 





	The Company believes that, as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable, its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix.





	Both the absolute amounts of the Companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. The Company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the Companys total revenue, revenue mix and overall financial performance. Such changes may result from a customers product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing strategies, production requirements and the like. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and, when the Company agrees to revise terms, revenues from the customer may be affected. The addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the Companys total revenue, revenue mix and operating results.





	Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $341,400 compared to $282,800 in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $58,600, or approximately 21%. Licenses, royalties and fees increased by $46,000, or approximately 41%, in the first quarter of 2017 to $158,800 from $112,800 in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in licenses, royalties and fees is due primarily to higher licensing revenue received from four licensees including one licensee added in the second half of 2016. There can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the Companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce a significant increase in revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide.





	Product and other sales increased by $12,600, or approximately 7%, to $182,600 in the first quarter of 2017 from $170,000 in the first quarter of 2016. Sales of ink increased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due primarily to higher ink shipments to the third party authorized printers used by two of the Companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the Companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company derived revenues of approximately $282,500 from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately $229,400 in the first quarter of 2016.





	The Companys gross profit increased to $248,200, or approximately 73% of gross revenues, in the first quarter of 2017 from $194,100, or approximately 69% of gross revenues, in the first quarter of 2016. Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales, which generally consist of either supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the Companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by the Company) are generally purchased from third-party vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees.





	As the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial, period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from these sources as well as the Companys overall gross profit. Primarily due to the increase in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees increased to approximately 87% in the first quarter of 2017 from approximately 83% in the first quarter of 2016.





	The gross profit of product and other sales, expressed as a percentage of revenues, is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. Primarily due to higher sales of inks and other products and a favorable product mix in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, there was a higher gross profit from product and other sales of approximately 60% of revenues in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a gross profit of approximately 59% of revenues in the first quarter of 2016.





	Research and development expenses of $36,400 in the first quarter of 2017 were comparable to $37,600 in the first quarter of 2016.





	Sales and marketing expenses increased to $60,900 in the first quarter of 2017 from $56,500 in the first quarter of 2016 due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of revenues in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.






	9







	 





	General and administrative expenses increased in the first quarter of 2017 to $90,700 compared to $87,500 in the first quarter of 2016 due primarily to higher employment expenses in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 offset in part by lower legal expenses in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.





	Other income (expenses) in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 included interest on unsecured loans from two individuals and on convertible debentures held by nine investors. Also included in other income (expenses) is accretion of debt discounts in the first quarter of 2017 related to the extension of the maturity dates of $33,300 of convertible debentures.





	The higher net income of $44,000 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $9,100 in the first quarter of 2016 resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues offset in part by higher operating expenses in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 and accretion of debt discounts in the first quarter of 2017.






	Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources






	During the first quarter of 2017, the Companys cash decreased to $150,100 at March 31, 2017 from $199,100 at December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company used $48,300 to fund its operating activities and $700 for capital equipment purchases.





	During the first quarter of 2017, the Companys revenues increased approximately 21% primarily as a result of higher sales of ink to the authorized printers of four of the Companys licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and from higher licensing and royalty revenues from new and existing licensees. The Companys first quarter 2017 total overhead expenses increased compared to the 2016 first quarter total overhead expenses and the Companys interest expense increased related to accretion of interest in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. As a result of these factors, the Companys generated higher net income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The Company had negative operating cash flow of $48,300 during the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2017, the Company had negative working capital of $103,100 and a stockholders deficiency of $122,400. For the full year of 2016, the Company had net income of $258,500 and had positive operating cash flow of $202,600. At December 31, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $194,600 and a $179,600 stockholders deficiency.





	Since January 1, 2015, the Company repaid $53,000 of $63,000 of short-term loans that had been outstanding at January 1, 2015 and in, 2015, repaid $10,000 of convertible debentures and extended the maturity dates of $95,000 of convertible debentures from 2015 to 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company extended the maturity dates of $33,300 of convertible debentures form 2016 to 2018. These borrowings allowed the Company to remain in operation through late 2016 when the Companys cash flow increased significantly. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding, if needed, through investments or borrowings. The Company believes that without additional investment, it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future if it is unable to sustain revenues at levels equal to or greater than it achieved in 2016.





	The Companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the Companys technologies since 2012. These two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are well known and highly regarded participants in this market. The Company believes that these two licensees will expand their offerings incorporating the Companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them. The Company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market. The Company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the Companys technologies in certain geographic and niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market. In late 2015, the Company added a licensee who began marketing products incorporating the Companys available technologies in certain international markets in 2016. The Company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market. The Company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary. The Company will also, subject to available financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity. Additionally, the Company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and non-security markets. There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.









	10







	 





	The Company has received and may continue to seek additional capital, in the form of debt, equity or both, to support its working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.





	The Company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets. During the year, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment. As a result, the Companys revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years.






	Risk Factors






	The Companys operating results, financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks, some of which are beyond the Companys control. These risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the Companys forward-looking statements, including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the SEC including the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 that was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2017:






	Limited Interim Historical Information.

	In September 2015, the Company filed a comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Form 10-K contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 2012 and for each of the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2013 and 2014. As the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed, certain financial information, disclosures and discussions normally contained in a Form 10-Q were not included in the Form 10-K. The omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors, customers, employees and others without this source of information about the Companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the Companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to remain current with its required SEC filing obligations in the future.






	Access to Capital.

	The Company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. If the Company is unable to secure capital, if needed, in the future, in the form debt, equity or both, it may be forced to cease operations. There can be no assurances that, if required, the Company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations.






	Dependency on Major Customers.

	The Company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues. The inability of the Companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the Companys technologies could adversely affect the Companys operating results and cash flow. To the extent that the Companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions, the Companys revenues may also be negatively impacted. The Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers. Revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly, through the licensees third party authorized printers, equaled approximately 76% of the Companys revenues in the first quarter of 2017 and approximately 80% of the Companys revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016. Receivables from these two licensees and their third party authorized printers were approximately 89% and 83% of the Companys net accounts receivable at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties, which will be met during 2017, expiring in 2019 with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in 2017. Products incorporating the Companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution. These two licensees are well known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market. The agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will continue in force at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates, nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the Company in the future.









	11







	 






	Possible Inability to Develop New Business

	. Management of the Company believes that any significant improvement in the Companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources. The Company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible. The Companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities, both of which are limited. There are no assurances that the resources that the Company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future.






	Inability to Obtain Raw Materials and Products for Resale.

	The Companys adverse financial condition in years prior to 2016 has required it from time to time to significantly defer payments due to (i) vendors who supply raw materials and other components of its security inks, (ii) providers of professional and other services and (iii) certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed. As a result, the Company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers. The inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the Company with needed products and services may result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the Companys ability to service its customers, thereby adversely affecting the Companys relationships with its customers and licensees. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner.






	Uneven Pattern of Quarterly and Annual Operating Results

	. The Companys revenues, which are derived primarily from licensing, royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies, are difficult to forecast; such forecasting difficulty is due to, among other reasons,  the long sales cycle of the Companys technologies, the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the Companys technologies, the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements, the success of the Companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products, modifications of customer budgets, and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders. As the Companys revenue base is not substantial, delays in finalizing license contracts, implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the Companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations. As the Companys operating expenses are substantially fixed, income expectations will be subject to a similar adverse outcome. As licensees for the entertainment and toy products markets are added, the predictability of the Companys revenue stream may be further impacted.






	Volatility of Stock Price

	. The market price for the Companys common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so. From inception, with the exception of 2007, 2013, 2014 and 2016, the Company has operated at a loss and has not produced revenue levels traditionally associated with publicly-traded companies. The Companys common stock is not listed on a national or regional securities exchange and, consequently, the Company receives limited publicity regarding its business achievements and prospects. Additionally, securities analysts and traders do not extensively follow the Companys stock and its stock is thinly traded. The Companys market price may be affected by announcements of new relationships or modifications to existing relationships. The stock prices of many developing public companies, particularly those with small capitalizations, have experienced wide fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance. Such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.






	Intellectual Property.

	The Company relies on a combination of protections as may be available under applicable domestic, foreign or international patent, trademark and trade secret laws. The Company also relies on confidentiality, non-analysis and licensing agreements to establish and protect its rights in its proprietary technologies. While the Company attempts to protect these rights, its technologies may be compromised through reverse engineering, independent invention or other means. In addition, the Companys ability to enforce its intellectual property rights through appropriate legal action has been and will continue to be limited by its adverse liquidity. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to protect the basis of its technologies from discovery by third parties or to preclude third parties from conducting activities that infringe on the Companys rights. The Companys adverse liquidity situation also impacts its ability to obtain patent protection on its intellectual property and to maintain protection on previously issued patents. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to continue to prosecute new patents and maintain issued patents. As a result, the Companys customer and licensee relationships could be adversely affected, and the value of the Companys technologies and intellectual property (including their value upon liquidation) could be substantially diminished.









	12







	 






	Economic Conditions

	. The Companys revenue is susceptible to changes in general economic conditions. The Companys sales, liquidity and overall results of operations may be negatively affected by decreasing consumer confidence, slowdowns in consumer spending or other downturns in the U.S. economy as a whole or in any geographic markets from which the Company derives revenue. In addition, these factors may result in decreased customer and licensee demand for the Companys products and may negatively impact the Companys ability to develop new customers and licensees. Due to uncertainties surrounding the worldwide economy, the Company is unable to predict the effect of such conditions on its customers and licensees. Consequently, the Company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect resulting from ongoing global financial uncertainties or economic slowdowns.






	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements






	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,

	Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) income tax consequences; (2) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and (3) classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted the amendments on January 1, 2017 and had no impact on the financial statements since any excess tax benefits were fully offset by a valuation allowance and not recognized for financial statement purposes.





	As of March 31, 2017, there were no other recently adopted accounting pronouncements that had a material effect on the Companys financial statements.






	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted






	As of March 31, 2017, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted which would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.









	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk








	Not applicable.









	Item 4. Controls and Procedures








	(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	The Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified within the rules and forms of the SEC, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in these reports is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.





	(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	There have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)







	Note 1. Financial Statements






	The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by Nocopi Technologies, Inc. (the Company). These statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which management believes necessary for a fair presentation of the statements and have been prepared on a consistent basis using the accounting policies described in the summary of Accounting Policies included in the Company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the accompanying disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The Notes to Financial Statements included in the 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interim financial statements. The interim operating results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 may not be necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the full year.





	The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220 in reporting comprehensive income. Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income. Since the Company has no items of other comprehensive income, comprehensive income (loss) is equal to net income (loss).






	Note 2. Going Concern






	Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and, as of September 30, 2015, had accumulated losses of $13,494,100. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had a net loss from operations of $29,200. At September 30, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $409,600 and a stockholders deficiency of $481,500. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Companys net income from operations was $29,000. Due in part to uncertainties in the US economy, the Company, which is substantially dependent on its licensees to generate licensing revenues, may incur operating losses and experience negative cash flow in the future. Achieving profitability and positive cash flow depends on the Companys ability to generate and sustain significant increases in revenues and gross profits from its traditional business. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate sufficient revenues and gross profits to return to and sustain profitability and positive cash flow in the future.





	During 2013 and 2014, the Company sold convertible debentures totaling $110,000 to eight investors and received an unsecured loan of $3,000 from an individual. Receipt of funds from these investors and from the demand loan holder has permitted the Company to continue in operation to the current date. Management of the Company believes that it may need additional capital in the future both to fund investments needed to increase its operating revenues to levels that will sustain its operations and to fund operating deficits that it believes may occur until revenue increases from traditional and new product lines can be realized. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient additional capital, or if it does, that the additional capital will enable the Company to impact its revenues so as to have a material positive effect on the Companys operations and cash flow. The Company believes that without additional capital, whether in the form of debt, equity or both, it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined future date.






	Note 3. Stock Based Compensation






	The Company follows FASB ASC 718,

	Compensation  Stock Compensation

	, and uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of an award.





	At September 30, 2015, the Company had no exercisable or non-exercisable options to purchase the Companys common stock outstanding. The Companys stock option plan terminated in 2009 and no further stock options could be granted under the plan; however, stock options granted before the termination date could have been exercised through their expiration dates. All remaining options granted under the plan expired in February 2014. There was no unrecognized portion of expense related to stock option grants at September 30, 2015.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)










	Note 4.


	Promissory Note






	In 2008, the Company negotiated a $100,000 revolving line of credit with a bank to provide a source of working capital. The line of credit was secured by all the assets of the Company and bore interest at the banks prime rate plus 0.5%. During the term of the line of credit, the interest rate applicable to the Companys line of credit was 3.75%. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company borrowed the entire $100,000 available under the line of credit. Until the third quarter of 2010, the Company had been required to pay interest only on borrowings under the line of credit. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company was notified by the bank that the line of credit was not being renewed and was offered repayment terms, which the Company accepted, to repay the outstanding loan balance in forty-eight equal monthly installments of $2,083, plus interest at the banks prime rate plus 0.5%, which was 3.75% throughout the repayment term, beginning in October 2010. In early July 2014, the Company repaid $6,250, the then remaining outstanding balance of the note.






	Note 5. Demand Loans






	At September 30, 2015, the Company had unsecured loans totaling $33,000 from three individuals outstanding. The loans bear interest at 8%. During the first nine months of 2015, the Company repaid $30,000 of the unsecured loans.






	Note 6. Convertible Debentures






	At September 30, 2015, the Company had convertible debentures totaling $127,600 outstanding, of which $32,600 are due during the third quarter of 2016 and $95,000 are due during the third quarter of 2017. The convertible debentures bear interest at 7%. At the option of the lender, the debentures and accrued interest are convertible in whole or part into common stock of the Company at $0.025 per share. In July 2015, the Company repaid, with interest, a $10,000 convertible debenture that had matured. During the third quarter of 2015, the Companys Board of Directors approved and the holders of $95,000 of convertible debentures maturing during the third quarter of 2015 accepted an offer of extension whereby the maturity dates of the convertible debentures are extended for two years and the conversion rate of the debentures and accrued interest into Common Stock of the Company is reduced from $0.05 to $0.025. In accordance with FASB ASC 470, this modification of the convertible debentures was recorded as a debt discount to the notes payable of approximately $18,100 with an offsetting credit to additional-paid in capital. In the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the entire $18,100 was accreted through interest expense.





	The Company also granted warrants to purchase 691,365 shares of the Companys common stock at $0.02 per share to the holders of the debentures. The warrants are exercisable two years after issuance and expire seven years after issuance. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The relative fair value of the warrants was recorded as a discount to the notes payable with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital since the Company determined that the warrants were an equity instrument in accordance with FASB ASC 815. The debt discount related to the warrant issuances is being accreted through interest expense over the term of the notes payable. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately $300 and $2,900, respectively, was accreted through interest expense. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2014, approximately $1,300 and $3,400, respectively, was accreted through interest expense.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)










	Note 7. Other Income (Expenses)






	Other income (expenses) in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 includes interest on unsecured loans from five individuals, on convertible debentures held by ten investors and, in 2014, on funds borrowed under the Companys promissory note with a bank.






	Note 8. Income Taxes






	There is no income tax benefit for the losses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 because the Company has determined that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is not assured. The Company has created a valuation allowance for the entire amount of such benefits.





	There was no change in unrecognized tax benefits during the period ended September 30, 2015 and there was no accrual for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2015.





	Tax years from 2011 through 2014 remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.






	Note 9. Earnings (Loss) per Share






	In accordance with FASB ASC 260,

	Earnings per Share

	, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed using net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per common share involves the assumption that outstanding common shares are increased by shares issuable upon exercise of those stock options and warrants for which the market price exceeds the exercise price. The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such stock options and warrants is decreased by shares that could have been purchased by the Company with related proceeds. Because the Company reported a net loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, common stock equivalents, consisting of warrants to purchase common stock, were anti-dilutive.

	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company also maintains allowances for potential credit losses. The loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business operations and financial condition.

	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations









	Forward-Looking Information







	This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), regarding, among other things, anticipated improvements in operations, the Companys plans, earnings, cash flow and expense estimates, strategies and prospects, both business and financial. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, will, may, intend, estimate, potential, continue and similar expressions, as they relate to the Company, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.






	The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events, financial trends, market opportunities, competition, and the adequacy of the Companys available cash resources, which the Company believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. This Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements attributed to third parties. All such statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, including, without limitation, with respect to risks, uncertainties, anticipated operating efficiencies, new business prospects and the rate of expense increases. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, and because of the uncertainty relating to the current financial conditions in todays economic environment and the potential reduction in demand for the Companys products, you should not consider this information to be a guarantee by the Company or any other person that its objectives and plans will be achieved. When you consider these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the Risk Factors and other cautionary statements set forth in this Item 2 and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.





	The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report as well as with the Companys audited Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on September 11, 2015 and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information.






	Results of Operations






	The Companys revenues are derived from (i) royalties paid by licensees of the Companys technologies; (ii) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees; and (iii) the direct sale of (a) products incorporating the Companys technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and (b) equipment used to support the application of the Companys technologies, such as ink-jet printing systems. Royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by the Companys licensees and/or additional royalties, which typically vary with the licensees sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology. Technical services, in the form of on-site or telephone consultations by members of the Companys technical staff, may be offered to licensees of the Companys technologies. The consulting fees are billed at agreed upon per diem or hourly rates at the time the services are rendered. Service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided.





	The Company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows:





	a)


	License fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins. Upon inception of the license term, revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process, which generally is ratably over the license term;


	b)


	Product sales are recognized (i) upon shipment of products; (ii) when the price is fixed or determinable; and (iii) when collectability is reasonably assured; and


	c)


	Fees for technical services are recognized when (i) the service has been rendered; (ii) an arrangement exists; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.









	8







	 





	The Company believes that, as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable, its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix.





	Both the absolute amounts of the Companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. The Company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the Companys total revenue and on its revenue mix and overall financial performance. Such changes may result from a customers product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing strategies and the like. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and, when the Company agrees to revise terms, revenues from the customer may be affected. The addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the Companys total revenue, revenue mix and operating results.





	Revenues for the third quarter of 2015 were $236,400 compared to $208,800 in the third quarter of 2014, an increase of $27,600, or approximately 13%. Licenses, royalties and fees decreased by $6,300, or approximately 8%, to $76,700 in the third quarter of 2015 from $83,000 in the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in licenses, royalties and fees is due primarily to lower quarterly licensing revenues from an existing licensee in the entertainment and toy products market who signed a new four-year license late in the second quarter of 2015 offset in part by higher royalties from certain licensees, including one new licensee. While the financial terms of the new four-year license with the existing licensee approximate the former license in the aggregate, the timing and amount of payments of the license fees over the term of the new license are different from the earlier license. There can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the Companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce a significant increase in revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide.





	Product and other sales increased by $33,900, or approximately 27%, to $159,700 in the third quarter of 2015 from $125,800 in the third quarter of 2014. Sales of ink increased in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 due primarily to higher ink shipments to a third party authorized printer used by two of the Companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company derived revenues of approximately $181,400 from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately $140,500 in the third quarter of 2014.





	For the first nine months of 2015, revenues were $741,500, representing an increase of $111,700, or approximately 18% higher than revenues of $629,800 in the first nine months of 2014. Licenses, royalties and fees of $233,600 in the first nine months of 2015 were $6,900, or approximately 3%, lower than licenses, royalties and fees of $240,500 in the first nine months of 2014. The decrease in licenses, royalties and fees in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 is due primarily to lower consulting revenue related to the expiration of a consulting arrangement with a customer in 2014 offset in part by higher licensing revenues from existing licensees in the entertainment and toy products market.





	Product and other sales increased by $118,600, or approximately 30%, to $507,900 in the first nine months of 2015 from 389,300 in the first nine months of 2014. Sales of ink increased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 due primarily to higher ink shipments to a third party authorized printer used by two of the Companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the Companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market. The Company derived revenues of approximately $603,800 from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in the first nine months of 2015 compared to revenues of approximately $450,900 in the first nine months of 2014.

	The Companys gross profit increased to $154,100 in the third quarter of 2015, or approximately 65% of revenues, from $135,100 in the third quarter of 2014 or approximately 65% of revenues. Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales. Such other sales generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the Companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by the Company) are generally purchased from third-party vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees. The higher gross profit in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 results primarily from higher gross revenues from product and other sales in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 along with gross profit improvements related to both the mix of products sold and favorable raw material prices in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 offset in part by lower gross revenues from licenses, royalties and fees and product and other sales in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014.





	For the first nine months of 2015, gross profit was $473,400, or approximately 64% of revenues, compared to $399,100, or approximately 63% of revenues, in the first nine months of 2014. The higher gross profit in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014 results from the same positive factors as the increase in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014.





	As the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial, period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit. Primarily due to lower revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014, the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees declined to approximately 75% of revenues in the third quarter of 2015 from approximately 79% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014. The gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees was approximately 74% in the first nine months of 2015 compared to approximately 77% in first nine months of 2014 resulting from the same factors as the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014.





	The gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. The gross profit from product and other sales increased to approximately 60% of revenues in the third quarter of 2015 compared to approximately 55% of revenues in the third quarter of 2014. This increase was due to favorable margins on certain products due to a favorable mix of products sold and raw materials prices. For the first nine months of 2015, the gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, increased to approximately 59% of revenues from product and other sales compared to approximately 55% of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of 2014.





	Research and development expenses of $31,300 in the third quarter of 2015 and $95,300 in the first nine months of 2015 were comparable to $29,200 in the third quarter of 2014 and $90,200 in first nine months of 2014.





	Sales and marketing expenses increased to $49,100 in the third quarter of 2015 from $46,800 in the third quarter of 2014 and to $154,300 in the first nine months of 2015 from $141,000 in the first nine months of 2014. This increase is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2014.





	General and administrative expenses increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 to $101,600 and $253,000, respectively, from $75,900 and $189,500 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively, due primarily to higher expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2014 related to the Companys filing of the comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K and the first and second quarter 2015 Form 10-Qs that were filed during the third quarter of 2015. These expenses included legal and audit fees incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 as well as expenses related to the electronic filing of the documents.





	Other income (expenses) in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 includes interest on unsecured loans from five individuals, on convertible debentures held by ten investors and, in 2014, on funds borrowed under the Companys promissory note with a bank.





	The net loss of $49,800 and $61,400 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively, compared to the net loss of $22,400 and $37,500 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively, resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2014 offset by higher overhead expenses along with accretion of interest in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2014.

	Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources






	During the first nine months of 2015, the Companys cash increased to $154,800 at September 30, 2015 from $28,000 at December 31, 2014. During the first nine months of 2015, the Company generated $175,700 from its operating activities, used $8,900 for capital equipment, repaid $10,000 to a convertible debenture holder and repaid $30,000 to two individual lenders.





	During the first nine months of 2015, the Companys revenues increased primarily as a result of higher sales of ink to the authorized printer of four of the Companys licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and higher license fees from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market. The Companys total overhead expenses increased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the total overhead expenses in the first nine months of 2014. As a result of these factors, the Companys net loss increased in the first nine months of 2015 compared to the first nine months of 2014. The Company had positive operating cash flow of $175,700 during the first nine months of 2015. At September 30, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $409,600 and a stockholders deficiency of $481,500. For the full year of 2014, the Company had net income of $7,700 and had positive operating cash flow of $14,500. At December 31, 2014, the Company had negative working capital of $424,500 and a $438,200 stockholders deficiency.





	During 2010, the Company accepted an offer by a bank to repay the then outstanding balance of $100,000 under its line of credit, received in 2008, with that bank in forty-eight equal monthly installments, plus interest, beginning in October 2010. The remaining outstanding balance was repaid in July 2014. Through September 30, 2015, the Company repaid $37,500 of $96,500 in unsecured loans borrowed from five individuals, converted $1,500 of the principal of the unsecured loans and approximately $1,200 of accrued interest into 44,216 shares of its common stock and exchanged $24,500 of the principal of the unsecured loans and approximately $3,800 of accrued interest for convertible debentures totaling approximately $28,300. In 2014 and 2013, the Company raised $110,000 through the sale of convertible debentures to eight investors and, in 2015, repaid $10,000 of the convertible debentures. These borrowings and sales of common stock in recent years have allowed the Company to remain in operation through the current date. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding through investments or borrowings that will allow the Company to fund losses that it presently believes may continue during 2015. The Company believes that without additional investment, it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future.





	The Companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the Companys technologies since 2012. These two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are well known and highly regarded participants in this market. The Company believes that these two licensees will expand their offerings incorporating the Companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them. The Company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market. The Company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the Companys technologies in certain niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market. The Company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market. The Company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary. The Company will also, subject to available financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity. Additionally, the Company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and non-security markets. There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.





	The Company has received and continues to seek additional capital, in the form of debt, equity or both, to support its working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.





	The Company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets. During the year, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment. As a result, the Companys revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years.

	Risk Factors






	The Companys operating results, financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks, some of which are beyond the Companys control. These risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the Companys forward-looking statements, including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the SEC including the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 that was filed with the SEC on September 11, 2015:






	Limited Interim Historical Information.

	The Company filed a comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 on September 11, 2015. The Form 10-K contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 2012 and for each of the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2013 and 2014. As the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed, certain financial information, disclosures and discussions normally contained in a Form 10-Q were not included in the Form 10-K. The omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors, customers, employees and others without this source of information about the Companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the Companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to remain current with its required SEC filing obligations in the future.






	Access to Capital.

	The Company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. If the Company is unable to secure capital, if needed, in the future, in the form debt, equity or both, it may be forced to cease operations. There can be no assurances that, if required, the Company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations.






	Dependency on Major Customers.

	The Company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues. The inability of the Companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the Companys technologies could adversely affect the Companys operating results and cash flow. To the extent that the Companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions, the Companys revenues may also be negatively impacted. The Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers. Revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly, through the licensees third party authorized printer, equaled approximately 74% and 79% of the Companys revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively, and approximately 68% of the Companys revenues in 2014. The Company also has, from time to time, substantial receivables from these businesses. The Company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties expiring in 2019 with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in 2017. Products incorporating the Companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution. These two licensees are well known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market. The agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will continue in force at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates, nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the Company in the future.






	Possible Inability to Develop New Business

	. Management of the Company believes that any significant improvement in the Companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources. The Company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible. The Companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities, both of which are limited. There are no assurances that the resources that the Company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future.









	12







	 






	Inability to Obtain Raw Materials and Products for Resale.

	The Companys adverse financial condition in the past has required it to significantly defer payments due to (i) vendors who supply raw materials and other components of the lines of inks marketed by the Company, (ii) providers of professional and other services and (iii) certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed. As a result, the Company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers. The inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the Company with needed products and services threaten to result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the Companys ability to service its customers, thereby adversely affecting the Companys relationships with its customers and licensees. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner.






	Uneven Pattern of Quarterly and Annual Operating Results

	. The Companys revenues, which are derived primarily from licensing, royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies, are difficult to forecast; such forecasting difficulty is due to, among other reasons, the long sales cycle of the Companys technologies, the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the Companys technologies, the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements, the success of the Companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products, modifications of customer budgets, and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders. As the Companys revenue base is not substantial, delays in finalizing license contracts, implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the Companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations. As the Companys operating expenses are substantially fixed, income expectations will be subject to a similar adverse outcome. As licensees for the entertainment and toy products markets are added, the predictability of the Companys revenue stream may be further impacted.






	Volatility of Stock Price

	. The market price for the Companys common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so. From inception, with the exception of 2007, 2013 and 2014, the Company has operated at a loss and has not produced revenue levels traditionally associated with publicly-traded companies. The Companys common stock is not listed on a national or regional securities exchange and, consequently, the Company receives limited publicity regarding its business achievements and prospects. Additionally, securities analysts and traders do not extensively follow the Companys stock and its stock is thinly traded. The Companys market price may be affected by announcements of new relationships or modifications to existing relationships. The stock prices of many developing public companies, particularly those with small capitalizations, have experienced wide fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance. Such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.






	Intellectual Property.

	The Company relies on a combination of protections provided under applicable international patent, trademark and trade secret laws. The Company also relies on confidentiality, non-analysis and licensing agreements to establish and protect its rights in its proprietary technologies. While the Company actively attempts to protect these rights, its technologies may be compromised through reverse engineering or other means. In addition, the Companys ability to enforce its intellectual property rights through appropriate legal action has been and will continue to be limited by its adverse liquidity. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to protect the basis of its technologies from discovery by unauthorized third parties or to preclude unauthorized persons from conducting activities that infringe on the Companys rights. The Companys adverse liquidity situation also impacts its ability to obtain patent protection on its intellectual property and to maintain protection on previously issued patents. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to continue to prosecute new patents and maintain issued patents. As a result, the Companys customer and licensee relationships could be adversely affected, and the value of the Companys technologies and intellectual property (including their value upon liquidation) could be substantially diminished.






	Economic Conditions

	. The Companys revenue is susceptible to changes in general economic conditions. The Companys sales, liquidity and overall results of operations may be negatively affected by decreasing consumer confidence, slowdowns in consumer spending or other downturns in the U.S. economy as a whole or in any geographic markets from which the Company derives revenue. In addition, these factors may result in decreased customer and licensee demand for the Companys products and may negatively impact the Companys ability to develop new customers and licensees. Due to uncertainties surrounding the worldwide economy, the Company is unable to predict the effect of such conditions on its customers and licensees. Consequently, the Company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect resulting from ongoing global financial uncertainties or economic slowdowns.






	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements






	As of September 30, 2015 and for the period then ended, there were no recently adopted accounting pronouncements that had a material effect on the Companys financial statements.






	13







	 






	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted






	As of September 30, 2015, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted which would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.









	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk








	Not applicable.









	Item 4. Controls and Procedures








	(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	The Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified within the rules and forms of the SEC, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in these reports is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.





	(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	There have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Information  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), regarding, among other things, anticipated improvements in operations, the Company's plans, earnings, cash flow and expense estimates, strategies and prospects, both business and financial. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements. The words "believe,'' "expect,'' "anticipate,'' "should,'' "plan,'' "will,'' "may,'' "intend,'' "estimate,'' "potential,'' "continue'' and similar expressions, as they relate to the Company, are intended to identify, where possible, forward-looking statements.  The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events, financial trends, market opportunities, competition, and the adequacy of the Company's available cash resources, which the Company believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. This Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements attributed to third parties. All such statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, including, without limitation, with respect to risks, uncertainties, anticipated operating efficiencies, new business prospects and the rate of expense increases. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, and because of the uncertainty relating to the current financial conditions in today's economic environment and the potential reduction in demand for the Company's products, you should not consider this information to be a guarantee by the Company or any other person that its objectives and plans will be achieved. When you consider these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the "Risk Factors" and other cautionary statements set forth in this Item 2 and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Company's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report as well as with the Company's audited Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 30, 2016 and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information.  Results of Operations  The Company's revenues are derived from (i) royalties paid by licensees of the Company's technologies; (ii) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees; and (iii) the direct sale of (a) products incorporating the Company's technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and  The Company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows:  a) License fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins. Upon inception of the license term, revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process, which generally is ratably over the license term;  b) Product sales are recognized (i) upon shipment of products; (ii) when the price is fixed or determinable; and (iii) when collectability is reasonably assured; and  c) Fees for technical services are recognized when (i) the service has been rendered; (ii) an arrangement exists; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company believes that, as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable, its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix.  Both the absolute amounts of the Company's revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. The Company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the Company's total revenue and on its revenue mix and overall financial performance. Such changes may result from a customer's product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing strategies and the like. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and, when the Company agrees to revise terms, revenues from the customer may be affected. The addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the Company's total revenue, revenue mix and operating results.  Revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $543,700 compared to $236,400 in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $307,300, or approximately 130%. Licenses, royalties and fees increased by $93,600, or approximately 122%, to $170,300 in the third quarter of 2016 from $76,700 in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in licenses, royalties and fees is due primarily to higher quarterly licensing revenues from an existing licensee in the entertainment and toy products market who signed a new four-year license late in the second quarter of 2015 along with higher royalties from certain licensees, including one new licensee. There can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the Company's licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce sustained increases in revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide.  Product and other sales increased by $213,700, or approximately 134%, to $373,400 in the third quarter of 2016 from $159,700 in the third quarter of 2015. Sales of ink increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to a significant volume of ink shipped in the third quarter of 2016 to a new third party authorized printer used by one of the Company's major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the Company's licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company derived revenues of approximately $490,100 from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately $181,400 in the third quarter of 2015.  For the first nine months of 2016, revenues were $1,029,900, representing an increase of $288,400, or approximately 39% higher than revenues of $741,500 in the first nine months of 2015. Licenses, royalties and fees of $381,800 in the first nine months of 2016 were $148,200, or approximately 63%, higher than licenses, royalties and fees of $233,600 in the first nine months of 2015. The increase in licenses, royalties and fees in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 is due primarily to higher licensing revenues from existing licensees in the entertainment and toy products market.  Product and other sales increased by $140,200, or approximately 28%, to $648,100 in the first nine months of 2016 from $507,900 in the first nine months of 2015. Sales of ink increased in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to a higher volume of ink shipped to the third party authorized printers used by two of the Company's major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the Company's licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market. The Company derived revenues of approximately $883,800 from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in the first nine months of 2016 compared to revenues of approximately $603,800 in the first nine months of 2015.  The Company's gross profit increased to $350,300 in the third quarter of 2016, or approximately 64% of revenues, from $154,100 in the third quarter of 2015, or approximately 65% of revenues. Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales. Such other sales generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the Company's technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by the Company) are generally purchased from third-party vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees. The higher gross profit in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 results primarily from higher gross revenues from licenses, royalties and fees and from product and other sales in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  For the first nine months of 2016, gross profit was $681,700, or approximately 66% of revenues, compared to $473,400, or approximately 64% of revenues, in the first nine months of 2015. The higher gross profit in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 results from the same positive factors as the increase in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  As the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial, period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit. Primarily due to higher revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees increased to approximately 79% of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 from approximately 75% of revenues in the third quarter of 2015. The gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees was approximately 81% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to approximately 74% in first nine months of 2015 resulting from the same factors as the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. The gross profit from product and other sales decreased to approximately 58% of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 compared to approximately 60% of revenues in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease in the gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a change in mix of products sold during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, the gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased to approximately 58% of revenues from product and other sales compared to approximately 59% of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of 2015.  Research and development expenses of $33,700 in the third quarter of 2016 and $103,700 in the first nine months of 2016 were comparable to $31,300 in the third quarter of 2015 and $95,300 in the first nine months of 2015.  Sales and marketing expenses increased to $72,800 in the third quarter of 2016 from $49,100 in the third quarter of 2015 and to $176,700 in the first nine months of 2016 from $154,300 in the first nine months of 2015. This increase is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015.  General and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 to $69,900 and $224,200, respectively, from $101,600 and $253,000 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively, due primarily to lower legal and audit expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company incurred significant expenses related to the filing of the comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K and the first and second quarter 2015 Form 10-Q's that were filed during the third quarter of 2015. These expenses included legal and audit fees in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 as well as expenses related to the electronic filing of the documents.  Other income (expenses) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 and 2015 included interest on unsecured loans from three individuals and on convertible debentures held by ten investors. Other income (expenses) decreased to $3,300 in the third quarter of 2016 from $21,900 in the third quarter of 2015 and to $10,100 in the first nine months of 2016 from $32,200 in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense on the lower level of unsecured loans and convertible debentures and lower accretion of interest in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015.  The net income of $170,600 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the net loss of $49,800 in the third quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 along with lower operating expenses, interest expense and accretion of interest in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net income of $167,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the net loss of $61,400 in the first nine months of 2015 resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues, lower interest expense and lower accretion of interest in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 offset in part by higher operating expenses in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.  Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company's cash increased to $37,100 at September 30, 2016 from $11,400 at December 31, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, the Company generated $40,600 from its operating activities, used $1,400 for capital equipment and repaid $13,500 to an individual lender.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Company's revenues increased primarily as a result of significant sales of ink to a new authorized printer of one of the Company's licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and higher license fees from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower sales of ink to an existing authorized printer for certain licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. The Company's operating expenses increased nominally in the first nine months of 2016 compared to operating expenses in the first nine months of 2015. As a result of these factors, the Company recorded a net profit in the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net loss in the first nine months of 2015. The Company had positive operating cash flow of $40,600 during the first nine months of 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $287,900 and a stockholders' deficiency of $271,100. For the full year of 2015, the Company had a net loss of $18,000 and had positive operating cash flow of $41,800. At December 31, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $364,000 and a $438,100 stockholders' deficiency.  Through September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $53,000 of $63,000 of short-term loans that had been outstanding at January 1, 2015. In 2015, the Company repaid $10,000 of convertible debentures and extended the maturity dates of $95,000 of convertible debentures from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2017. Borrowings and sales of common stock in years prior to January 1, 2015 have allowed the Company to remain in operation through the current date. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding through investments or borrowings that will allow the Company to fund losses that it presently believes may be experienced in the future. The Company believes that without additional investment, it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future.  The Company's plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the Company's technologies since 2012. These two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are well-known and highly regarded participants in this market. The Company believes that these two licensees will continue to expand their offerings incorporating the Company's technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them. The Company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market. The Company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the Company's technologies in certain niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market. In late 2015, the Company added a licensee who the Company believes will market products incorporating the Company's available technologies in certain international markets in late 2016 or early 2017. The Company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market could be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market. The Company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary. The Company will also, subject to available financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity. Additionally, the Company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and non-security markets. There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.  The Company has received and continues to seek additional capital, in the form of debt, equity or both, to support its working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.  The Company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets. During the year, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment. As a result, the Company's revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years.  Risk Factors  The Company's operating results, financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks, some of which are beyond the Company's control. These risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company's forward-looking statements, including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the SEC including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016:  Limited Interim Historical Information. In September 2015, the Company filed a comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Form 10-K contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 2012 and for each of the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2013 and 2014. As the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed, certain financial information, disclosures and discussions normally contained in a Form 10-Q were not included in the Form 10-K. The omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors, customers, employees and others without this source of information about the Company's business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the Company's business opportunities and its ability to raise capital. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to remain current with its required SEC filing obligations in the future.  Access to Capital. The Company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions would make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. If the Company is unable to secure capital, if needed, in the future, in the form debt, equity or both, it may be forced to cease operations. There can be no assurances that, if required, the Company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations.  Dependency on Major Customers. The Company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues. The inability of the Company's licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the Company's technologies would adversely affect the Company's operating results and cash flow. To the extent that the Company's licensees are affected by negative economic conditions, the Company's revenues would also be negatively impacted. The Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers. Revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly, through the licensees' third party authorized printers, equaled approximately 87% and 81% of the Company's revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and approximately 73% of the Company's revenues in 2015. Receivables from these two licensees and their third party authorized printers were approximately 87% and 58% of the Company's net accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties expiring in 2019 with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in 2017. Products incorporating the Company's technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution. These two licensees are well-known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market. The agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will be renewed or that they will be renewed at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates, nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the Company in the future.  Possible Inability to Develop New Business. Management of the Company believes that any significant improvement in the Company's cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources. The Company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible. The Company's ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities, both of which are limited. There are no assurances that the resources that the Company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future.  Inability to Obtain Raw Materials and Products for Resale. The Company's adverse financial condition in the past has required it to significantly defer payments due to (i) vendors who supply raw materials and other components of the lines of inks marketed by the Company, (ii) providers of professional and other services and (iii) certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed. As a result, the Company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers. The inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the Company with needed products and services threaten to result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the Company's ability to service its customers, thereby adversely affecting the Company's relationships with its customers and licensees. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner.  Uneven Pattern of Quarterly and Annual Operating Results. The Company's revenues, which are derived primarily from licensing, royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies, are difficult to forecast; such forecasting difficulty is due to, among other reasons, the long sales cycle of the Company's technologies, the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the Company's technologies, the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements, the success of the Company's licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products, modifications of customer budgets, and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders. As the Company's revenue base is not substantial, delays in finalizing license contracts, implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the Company's quarterly and annual revenue expectations.

	NOCOPI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.









	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)







	Note 1. Financial Statements






	The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared by Nocopi Technologies, Inc. (the Company). These statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which management believes necessary for a fair presentation of the statements and have been prepared on a consistent basis using the accounting policies described in the summary of Accounting Policies included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain financial information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the accompanying disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The Notes to Financial Statements included in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interim financial statements. The interim operating results for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be necessarily indicative of the operating results expected for the full year.





	The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220 in reporting comprehensive income.  Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income.  Since the Company has no items of other comprehensive income, comprehensive income (loss) is equal to net income (loss).






	Note 2. Going Concern






	Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant losses and, as of September 30, 2016, had accumulated losses of $13,283,700. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had net income from operations of $177,100. At September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $287,900 and a stockholders deficiency of $271,100. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Companys net loss from operations was $38,700. The Company, which is substantially dependent on its licensees to generate licensing revenues, may incur operating losses and experience negative cash flow in the future. Achieving ongoing profitability and positive cash flow depends on the Companys ability to generate and maintain increases in revenues and gross profits from its traditional business. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to generate sufficient revenues and gross profits to sustain profitability and positive cash flow in the future.





	Receipt of funds in periods prior to 2015 from investors and from demand loan holders have allowed the Company to remain in operation through the current date. Management of the Company believes that it may need additional capital if the Company is unable to continue to increase the revenue level and profits realized in the three months ended September 30, 2016 from traditional and new product lines. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient additional capital, or if it does, that the additional capital will enable the Company to impact its revenues so as to have a material positive effect on the Companys operations and cash flow. The Company believes that without additional capital, whether in the form of debt, equity or both, it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined future date.






	Note 3. Stock Based Compensation






	The Company follows FASB ASC 718,

	Compensation  Stock Compensation

	, and uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of an award. At September 30, 2016, the Company did not have an active stock option plan. There was no unrecognized portion of expense related to stock option grants at September 30, 2016.






	Note 4. Demand Loans






	At September 30, 2016, the Company had a $10,000 unsecured loan from one individual outstanding. The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 8%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid the remaining $13,500 principal balance of an unsecured loan from a second individual.

	Note 5. Convertible Debentures






	At September 30, 2016, the Company had convertible debentures totaling $128,300 outstanding, of which $33,300 were due during the third quarter of 2016 and $95,000 are due during the third quarter of 2017. The convertible debentures bear interest at 7%. At the option of the lender, $95,000 in principal of the debentures and accrued interest are convertible in whole or part into common stock of the Company at $0.025 per share and $33,300 principal of the debentures and accrued interest are convertible in whole or part into common stock of the Company at $0.05 per share. In July 2015, the Company repaid, with interest, a $10,000 convertible debenture that had matured. During the third quarter of 2015, $95,000 of convertible debentures matured. The Companys Board of Directors approved and the holders the convertible debentures accepted an offer of extension whereby (i) the maturity dates of the convertible debentures were extended for two years and (ii) the conversion rate of the debentures plus accrued interest into Common Stock was reduced from $0.05 to $0.025. In accordance with FASB ASC 470, this modification of the convertible debentures was recorded as a debt discount to the notes payable of approximately $18,100 with an offsetting credit to additional-paid in capital. In the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the entire $18,100 was accreted through interest expense.





	The Company is additionally negotiating the extension of the three convertible debentures totaling $33,300 that matured during the third quarter of 2016, one of which is held by a Director of the Company. The Company believes that extensions of the debentures can be achieved on acceptable terms.





	The Company also granted warrants to purchase 691,365 shares of the Companys common stock at $0.02 per share to the holders of the debentures. The warrants are exercisable two years after issuance and expire seven years after issuance. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The relative fair value of the warrants was recorded as a discount to the notes payable with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital since the Company determined that the warrants were an equity instrument in accordance with FASB ASC 815. The debt discount related to the warrant issuances has been accreted through interest expense over the term of the notes payable. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, $0 and approximately $500, respectively, was accreted through interest expense. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately $300 and $2,900, respectively, was accreted through interest expense.

	(UNAUDITED)










	Note 6. Other Income (Expenses)






	Other income (expenses) in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 includes interest on unsecured loans from three individuals and on convertible debentures held by ten investors.






	Note 7. Income Taxes






	There is no provision for income taxes for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards. There is no income tax benefit for the losses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 because the Company has determined that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is not assured. The Company has created a valuation allowance for the entire amount of such benefits.





	There was no change in unrecognized tax benefits during the period ended September 30, 2016 and there was no accrual for uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016.





	Tax years from 2012 through 2015 remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.






	Note 8. Related Party Transactions






	In January 2016, the Company paid $15,000 to Michael A. Feinstein, M.D., the Companys Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, representing a portion of previously deferred salary owed to him under an employment agreement with the Company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Dr. Feinstein deferred $63,800 of salary. At September 30, 2016, Dr. Feinstein was owed $339,200 of salary deferred by him.






	Note 9. Earnings (Loss) per Share






	In accordance with FASB ASC 260,

	Earnings per Share

	, basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed using net earnings (loss) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. The computation of diluted earnings per common share involves the assumption that outstanding common shares are increased by shares issuable upon exercise of those stock options and warrants for which the market price exceeds the exercise price. The number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such stock options and warrants is decreased by shares that could have been purchased by the Company with related proceeds. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the number of incremental common shares resulting from the assumed conversion of warrants was 639 and 1,368, respectively. Because the Company reported a net loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, common stock equivalents, consisting of stock options and warrants, were anti-dilutive.

	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations









	Forward-Looking Information







	This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), regarding, among other things, anticipated improvements in operations, the Companys plans, earnings, cash flow and expense estimates, strategies and prospects, both business and financial. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this report are forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, should, plan, will, may, intend, estimate, potential, continue and similar expressions, as they relate to the Company, are intended to identify, where possible, forward-looking statements.






	The Company has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events, financial trends, market opportunities, competition, and the adequacy of the Companys available cash resources, which the Company believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. This Form 10-Q also contains forward-looking statements attributed to third parties. All such statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, including, without limitation, with respect to risks, uncertainties, anticipated operating efficiencies, new business prospects and the rate of expense increases. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. For these reasons, and because of the uncertainty relating to the current financial conditions in todays economic environment and the potential reduction in demand for the Companys products, you should not consider this information to be a guarantee by the Company or any other person that its objectives and plans will be achieved. When you consider these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the Risk Factors and other cautionary statements set forth in this Item 2 and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. The Companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.





	The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report as well as with the Companys audited Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on March 30, 2016 and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information.






	Results of Operations






	The Companys revenues are derived from (i) royalties paid by licensees of the Companys technologies; (ii) fees for the provision of technical services to licensees; and (iii) the direct sale of (a) products incorporating the Companys technologies, such as inks, security paper and pressure sensitive labels, and (b) equipment used to support the application of the Companys technologies, such as ink-jet printing systems. Royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by the Companys licensees and/or additional royalties, which typically vary with the licensees sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology. Technical services, in the form of on-site or telephone consultations by members of the Companys technical staff, may be offered to licensees of the Companys technologies. The consulting fees are billed at agreed upon per diem or hourly rates at the time the services are rendered. Service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided.





	The Company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows:





	a) License fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins. Upon inception of the license term, revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process, which generally is ratably over the license term;





	b) Product sales are recognized (i) upon shipment of products; (ii) when the price is fixed or determinable; and (iii) when collectability is reasonably assured; and





	c) Fees for technical services are recognized when (i) the service has been rendered; (ii) an arrangement exists; (iii) the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.









	8







	 





	The Company believes that, as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable, its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels. Because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues, operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix.





	Both the absolute amounts of the Companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation. The Company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers. Accordingly, changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the Companys total revenue and on its revenue mix and overall financial performance. Such changes may result from a customers product development delays, engineering changes, changes in product marketing strategies and the like. In addition, certain customers have, from time to time, sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and, when the Company agrees to revise terms, revenues from the customer may be affected. The addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the Companys total revenue, revenue mix and operating results.





	Revenues for the third quarter of 2016 were $543,700 compared to $236,400 in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $307,300, or approximately 130%. Licenses, royalties and fees increased by $93,600, or approximately 122%, to $170,300 in the third quarter of 2016 from $76,700 in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in licenses, royalties and fees is due primarily to higher quarterly licensing revenues from an existing licensee in the entertainment and toy products market who signed a new four-year license late in the second quarter of 2015 along with higher royalties from certain licensees, including one new licensee. There can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the Companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce sustained increases in revenues for the Company, nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted, particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide.





	Product and other sales increased by $213,700, or approximately 134%, to $373,400 in the third quarter of 2016 from $159,700 in the third quarter of 2015. Sales of ink increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to a significant volume of ink shipped in the third quarter of 2016 to a new third party authorized printer used by one of the Companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the Companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company derived revenues of approximately $490,100 from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately $181,400 in the third quarter of 2015.





	For the first nine months of 2016, revenues were $1,029,900, representing an increase of $288,400, or approximately 39% higher than revenues of $741,500 in the first nine months of 2015. Licenses, royalties and fees of $381,800 in the first nine months of 2016 were $148,200, or approximately 63%, higher than licenses, royalties and fees of $233,600 in the first nine months of 2015. The increase in licenses, royalties and fees in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 is due primarily to higher licensing revenues from existing licensees in the entertainment and toy products market.





	Product and other sales increased by $140,200, or approximately 28%, to $648,100 in the first nine months of 2016 from $507,900 in the first nine months of 2015. Sales of ink increased in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to a higher volume of ink shipped to the third party authorized printers used by two of the Companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the Companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market. The Company derived revenues of approximately $883,800 from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in the first nine months of 2016 compared to revenues of approximately $603,800 in the first nine months of 2015.





	The Companys gross profit increased to $350,300 in the third quarter of 2016, or approximately 64% of revenues, from $154,100 in the third quarter of 2015, or approximately 65% of revenues. Licenses, royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales. Such other sales generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the Companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies. These items (except for inks which are manufactured by the Company) are generally purchased from third-party vendors and resold to the end-user or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses, royalties and fees. The higher gross profit in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 results primarily from higher gross revenues from licenses, royalties and fees and from product and other sales in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.

	For the first nine months of 2016, gross profit was $681,700, or approximately 66% of revenues, compared to $473,400, or approximately 64% of revenues, in the first nine months of 2015. The higher gross profit in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 results from the same positive factors as the increase in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.





	As the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses, royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial, period to period changes in revenues from licenses, royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit. Primarily due to higher revenues from licenses, royalties and fees in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015, the gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees increased to approximately 79% of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 from approximately 75% of revenues in the third quarter of 2015. The gross profit from licenses, royalties and fees was approximately 81% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to approximately 74% in first nine months of 2015 resulting from the same factors as the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.





	The gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced and/or sold. The gross profit from product and other sales decreased to approximately 58% of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 compared to approximately 60% of revenues in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease in the gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a change in mix of products sold during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, the gross profit, expressed as a percentage of revenues, decreased to approximately 58% of revenues from product and other sales compared to approximately 59% of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of 2015.





	Research and development expenses of $33,700 in the third quarter of 2016 and $103,700 in the first nine months of 2016 were comparable to $31,300 in the third quarter of 2015 and $95,300 in the first nine months of 2015.





	Sales and marketing expenses increased to $72,800 in the third quarter of 2016 from $49,100 in the third quarter of 2015 and to $176,700 in the first nine months of 2016 from $154,300 in the first nine months of 2015. This increase is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015.





	General and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 to $69,900 and $224,200, respectively, from $101,600 and $253,000 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015, respectively, due primarily to lower legal and audit expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company incurred significant expenses related to the filing of the comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K and the first and second quarter 2015 Form 10-Qs that were filed during the third quarter of 2015. These expenses included legal and audit fees in the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 as well as expenses related to the electronic filing of the documents.





	Other income (expenses) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 and 2015 included interest on unsecured loans from three individuals and on convertible debentures held by ten investors. Other income (expenses) decreased to $3,300 in the third quarter of 2016 from $21,900 in the third quarter of 2015 and to $10,100 in the first nine months of 2016 from $32,200 in the first nine months of 2015. This decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense on the lower level of unsecured loans and convertible debentures and lower accretion of interest in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2015.





	The net income of $170,600 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the net loss of $49,800 in the third quarter of 2015 resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 along with lower operating expenses, interest expense and accretion of interest in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net income of $167,000 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the net loss of $61,400 in the first nine months of 2015 resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues, lower interest expense and lower accretion of interest in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 offset in part by higher operating expenses in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.

	Plan of Operation, Liquidity and Capital Resources






	During the first nine months of 2016, the Companys cash increased to $37,100 at September 30, 2016 from $11,400 at December 31, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, the Company generated $40,600 from its operating activities, used $1,400 for capital equipment and repaid $13,500 to an individual lender.





	During the first nine months of 2016, the Companys revenues increased primarily as a result of significant sales of ink to a new authorized printer of one of the Companys licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and higher license fees from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower sales of ink to an existing authorized printer for certain licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. The Companys operating expenses increased nominally in the first nine months of 2016 compared to operating expenses in the first nine months of 2015. As a result of these factors, the Company recorded a net profit in the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net loss in the first nine months of 2015. The Company had positive operating cash flow of $40,600 during the first nine months of 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Company had negative working capital of $287,900 and a stockholders deficiency of $271,100. For the full year of 2015, the Company had a net loss of $18,000 and had positive operating cash flow of $41,800. At December 31, 2015, the Company had negative working capital of $364,000 and a $438,100 stockholders deficiency.





	Through September 30, 2016, the Company repaid $53,000 of $63,000 of short-term loans that had been outstanding at January 1, 2015. In 2015, the Company repaid $10,000 of convertible debentures and extended the maturity dates of $95,000 of convertible debentures from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2017. Borrowings and sales of common stock in years prior to January 1, 2015 have allowed the Company to remain in operation through the current date. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding through investments or borrowings that will allow the Company to fund losses that it presently believes may be experienced in the future. The Company believes that without additional investment, it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future.





	The Companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the Company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the Companys technologies since 2012. These two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are well-known and highly regarded participants in this market. The Company believes that these two licensees will continue to expand their offerings incorporating the Companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them. The Company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market. The Company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the Companys technologies in certain niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market. In late 2015, the Company added a licensee who the Company believes will market products incorporating the Companys available technologies in certain international markets in late 2016 or early 2017. The Company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market could be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market. The Company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary. The Company will also, subject to available financial resources, invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity. Additionally, the Company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and non-security markets. There can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.





	The Company has received and continues to seek additional capital, in the form of debt, equity or both, to support its working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in raising additional capital, or that such additional capital, if obtained, will enable the Company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow.





	The Company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market. These licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets. During the year, such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment. As a result, the Companys revenues, results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years.

	Risk Factors






	The Companys operating results, financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks, some of which are beyond the Companys control. These risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the Companys forward-looking statements, including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the SEC including the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016:






	Limited Interim Historical Information.

	In September 2015, the Company filed a comprehensive annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Form 10-K contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 2012 and for each of the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2013 and 2014. As the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed, certain financial information, disclosures and discussions normally contained in a Form 10-Q were not included in the Form 10-K. The omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors, customers, employees and others without this source of information about the Companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the Companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to remain current with its required SEC filing obligations in the future.






	Access to Capital.

	The Company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions would make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. If the Company is unable to secure capital, if needed, in the future, in the form debt, equity or both, it may be forced to cease operations. There can be no assurances that, if required, the Company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations.






	Dependency on Major Customers.

	The Company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues. The inability of the Companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the Companys technologies would adversely affect the Companys operating results and cash flow. To the extent that the Companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions, the Companys revenues would also be negatively impacted. The Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers. Revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly, through the licensees third party authorized printers, equaled approximately 87% and 81% of the Companys revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and approximately 73% of the Companys revenues in 2015. Receivables from these two licensees and their third party authorized printers were approximately 87% and 58% of the Companys net accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties expiring in 2019 with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in 2017. Products incorporating the Companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution. These two licensees are well-known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market. The agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will be renewed or that they will be renewed at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates, nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the Company in the future.






	Possible Inability to Develop New Business

	. Management of the Company believes that any significant improvement in the Companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources. The Company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The Company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible. The Companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities, both of which are limited. There are no assurances that the resources that the Company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future.









	12







	 






	Inability to Obtain Raw Materials and Products for Resale.

	The Companys adverse financial condition in the past has required it to significantly defer payments due to (i) vendors who supply raw materials and other components of the lines of inks marketed by the Company, (ii) providers of professional and other services and (iii) certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed. As a result, the Company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers. The inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the Company with needed products and services threaten to result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the Companys ability to service its customers, thereby adversely affecting the Companys relationships with its customers and licensees. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner.






	Uneven Pattern of Quarterly and Annual Operating Results

	. The Companys revenues, which are derived primarily from licensing, royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies, are difficult to forecast; such forecasting difficulty is due to, among other reasons,  the long sales cycle of the Companys technologies, the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the Companys technologies, the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements, the success of the Companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products, modifications of customer budgets, and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders. As the Companys revenue base is not substantial, delays in finalizing license contracts, implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the Companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations. As the Companys operating expenses are substantially fixed, income expectations will be subject to a similar adverse outcome. As licensees for the entertainment and toy products markets are added, the predictability of the Companys revenue stream may be further impacted.






	Volatility of Stock Price

	. The market price for the Companys common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so. From inception, with the exception of 2007, 2013 and 2014, the Company has operated at a loss and has not produced revenue levels traditionally associated with publicly-traded companies. The Companys common stock is not listed on a national or regional securities exchange and, consequently, the Company receives limited publicity regarding its business achievements and prospects. Additionally, securities analysts and traders do not extensively follow the Companys stock and its stock is thinly traded. The Companys market price may be affected by announcements of new relationships or modifications to existing relationships. The stock prices of many developing public companies, particularly those with small capitalizations, have experienced wide fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance. Such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.






	Intellectual Property.

	The Company relies on a combination of protections as may be available under applicable domestic, foreign or international patent, trademark and trade secret laws. The Company also relies on confidentiality, non-analysis and licensing agreements to establish and protect its rights in its proprietary technologies. While the Company attempts to protect these rights, its technologies may be compromised through reverse engineering, independent invention or other means. In addition, the Companys ability to enforce its intellectual property rights through appropriate legal action has been and will continue to be limited by its adverse liquidity. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to protect the basis of its technologies from discovery by third parties or to preclude third parties from conducting activities that infringe on the Companys rights. The Companys adverse liquidity situation also impacts its ability to obtain patent protection on its intellectual property and to maintain protection on previously issued patents. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to continue to prosecute new patents and maintain issued patents. As a result, the Companys customer and licensee relationships could be adversely affected, and the value of the Companys technologies and intellectual property (including their value upon liquidation) could be substantially diminished.






	Economic Conditions

	. The Companys revenue is susceptible to changes in general economic conditions. The Companys sales, liquidity and overall results of operations may be negatively affected by decreasing consumer confidence, slowdowns in consumer spending or other downturns in the U.S. economy as a whole or in any geographic markets from which the Company derives revenue. In addition, these factors may result in decreased customer and licensee demand for the Companys products and may negatively impact the Companys ability to develop new customers and licensees. Due to uncertainties surrounding the worldwide economy, the Company is unable to predict the effect of such conditions on its customers and licensees. Consequently, the Company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect resulting from ongoing global financial uncertainties or economic slowdowns.






	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements






	As of September 30, 2016 and for the period then ended, there were no recently adopted accounting pronouncements that had a material effect on the Companys financial statements.






	13







	 






	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted






	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,

	Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.

	The amendments in this Update provide guidance about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures. Substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The amendments in this Update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. Management is assessing the impact of the adoption to the financial statements.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.









	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk








	Not applicable.









	Item 4. Controls and Procedures








	(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	The Company has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified within the rules and forms of the SEC, and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in these reports is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.





	(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	There have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
