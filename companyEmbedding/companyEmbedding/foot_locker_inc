Foot Locker, Inc. is the world's leading retailer of athletic  			footwear and apparel. Headquartered in New York City, it operates  			approximately 3,600 athletic retail stores in 21 countries in North  			America, Europe and Australia under the brand names Foot Locker,  			Footaction, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker and Champs Sports.  			Additionally, the company's Footlocker.com/Eastbay business operates  			a rapidly growing direct-to-customers business offering athletic  			footwear, apparel and equipment through its Internet and catalog  			channels.


REAL ESTATE 
Managing the Company’s real estate portfolio of almost  			3,600 store locations efficiently requires an extensive organization  			of professionals that have specific expertise, including site  			selection, lease negotiations, construction, architecture and  			finance. Over the past several years, the Company has completed over  			500 real estate projects annually ,including store openings,  			closings, remodels and relocations. At the end of 2008,  			approximately 90 percent of the Company’s stores were new within the  			past five years or had been converted to one of its current  			prototypes.


MARKETING
Through innovative and integrated marketing programs, Foot  			Locker, Inc. positions each of its retail divisions as an authority  			on, and destination for, athletic footwear and apparel to satisfy  			its core consumer’s wants and needs. A clear and concise branding  			message is created and conveyed through a myriad of communication  			vehicles, including television, magazine, newspaper, on-line,  			in-store signage and exclusive VIP club membership e-mails, to name  			a few. Sports marketing, grassroots and community- based programs  			are tailored to increase brand awareness and further strengthen each  			division’s relationship with its customers.


GLOBAL SOURCING 
Key to Foot Locker, Inc.’s success is the experience of its  			merchant-led organization whose responsibilities include identifying  			new trends early to meet the needs of its target customers. This is  			accomplished by working closely with its vendors to deliver  			innovative, exclusive and fashion-right products to its stores. The  			Company has a large private label apparel program designed to  			provide quality offerings at lower price-points than branded  			products. These private-label products are designed by Company  			associates and sourced directly from third-party manufacturers. The  			Company also owns a manufacturing facility, Team Edition, which is  			its primary source of collegiate licensed apparel.


LOGISTICS 
Delivering the right product, to the right place, at the right time,  			at the right price and in the right quantities is critical to  			succeed in the retail industry. This objective is accomplished by  			Foot Locker, Inc. through the utilization of a global network of  			distribution and logistics systems. A combination of  			Company-operated and third-party distribution centers are  			strategically located around the world to allow for the timely,  			cost-effective delivery of goods to the stores. Transportation costs  			are minimized by utilizing the most efficient third-party carriers  			available and by negotiating rates on a centralized basis.


OTHER CORPORATE SERVICES 
The Company’s corporate staff also includes various departments  			whose associates have extensive expertise in the areas of finance,  			information systems and technology, human resources, legal and other  			corporate shared services. This shared infrastructure allows the  			Company to support its operating divisions with experienced  			professionals in a cost-effective manner by capitalizing on  			efficiencies of scale. Operating on a centralized basis also helps  			to ensure that internal standards are consistently applied across  			its various businesses.  Corporate staff are in our New York, NY, Camp  			Hill, PA, Milwaukee, WI and Bradenton, FL locations.

		Buy Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) Stock While It Smells Like Feet	
FL stock is reeling, but it's an opportunity for contrarian investors

Jun 21, 2017, 1:14 pm EDT  |  By Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Contributor



 
 

The all-time highs in Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) seem like years ago at this point. FL stock is down about 6% on Wednesday, marking a roughly 40% decline in just a few weeks, kicking it far off its perch near the highwater mark it set late last year.
Source: Shutterstock

Last week, grocery stores played the role of victim as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:WFM). Traditional grocers like Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) were killed as investors worried Amazon would leverage its extensive Prime ecosystem to finally make WFM affordable.
This week, the victims are sports retailers, with FL stock front and center.
Only a day after Amazon launched Prime Wardrobe, Goldman Sachs put out a research note which said that Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is likely to start selling its products directly through Amazon. Foot Locker, Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE:DKS) and Hibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB) are all down sharply in response.
It makes sense. The last two advantages brick-and-mortar sports retailers had (the in-store experience of trying things out, and a unique product line) are now slowly withering away. Not only can consumers now try out new sneakers before buying them from the convenience of their home, but it’s likely they’re also about to be able to grab Nike from the most ubiquitous e-tailer out there, making sports retailers obsolete.
Or are they?
I argue that this dip is actually a great buying opportunity for FL stock. Here’s why.
Why You Should Buy FL Stock
Prime Wardrobe and the potential of Nike selling through Amazon will hurt Foot Locker’s business, but only marginally. The opportunity here is that the stock is being priced for a cataclysmic change in operating performance.
That just won’t happen.
Investors should remember that much unlike other retailers, Foot Locker has successfully navigated its way through the retail carnage over the past several years. While other retailers have struggled to be comps-positive, Foot Locker’s comps have been rising in the mid-single-digit range. While other retailers have seen margins compress dramatically due to heavy discounting, Foot Locker’s gross margins have been stable around 33%-35%.
In other words, FL has managed to continue normal operations in an already exceedingly abnormal retail environment.
Yes, that environment promises to become even more abnormal with Prime Wardrobe and Nike selling through Amazon, but those are actually rather small changes in the bigger picture of what’s going on in retail.
FL shares, however, are acting like everything has changed dramatically — it hasn’t, which makes right now a buying opportunity.
Bottom Line on FL Stock
Foot Locker shares now trade below 10 times earnings, and that’s simply unheard of in this stock. Moreover, that’s against expectations that earnings will grow by high single digits over the next few years, making the P/E even more of a bargain. Foot Locker also sports a decent war chest of more than $1 billion, big cash flows and a growing dividend that is suddenly throwing off a decent yield of about 2.7%.
I see support kicking in soon. At this compressed a multiple, with such a strong balance sheet and cash flow situation, all of the bad is priced in and then some.
If the next couple of quarterly results show that things at Foot Locker are normal, expect FL stock to shoot higher in a collective gasp of relief.
The risk-reward asymmetry lies in favor of bulls at these levels.
As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, DKS, FL, KR and NKE.

How Foot Locker, Inc. Is Bucking The Trend in Retail
The sneaker vendor is putting up consistently strong sales growth while other retailers are flailing. 











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Nov 29, 2015 at 11:31AM
            
            





Retail stocks have gotten walloped this past quarter. Disappointing results at big-box chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Target, as well as department stores like Macy's and apparel chains like Gap, have caused a sell-off across the sector. Pressures including declining mall traffic, the growth of e-commerce, and fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara are all squeezing traditional retail giants. 
Not all stocks are getting lost in the shuffle, however. Foot Locker (NYSE:FL), that seemingly ordinary mall staple, has been thriving in the years since the recession. In its third-quarter earnings report, comparable sales jumped 8.7%, beating nearly every other retailer, and the stock shot up 6%. Over the last five years, shares of the athletic retailer have more than tripled, easily outperforming the S&P 500 and rivals like Finish Line (NASDAQ:FINL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), which have tumbled with the recent retail doldrums. 

FL data by YCharts
So what's in Foot Locker's secret sauce? Here are two of the main keys to the company's recent growth.
Riding the athleisure trendWhile plenty of retailers have gotten hammered in recent months, there's one particular segment of the industry that's been flying high. Athletic apparel sales have been soaring, pushing the stocks of manufacturers like Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Under Armour to record highs thanks to a fashion trend known as athleisure. Workout-style clothes have become more acceptable as casualwear, and more and more Americans are trading in jeans for yoga pants and other such staples of the segment. 





That trend has also favored sales of sneakers, Foot Locker's core product. The chain has a 45% share of the market for basketball shoes, which tend to be expensive and high-margin, and from which the company derives half of its sales. In its recent earnings call, management noted that the sneakers of young players like Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry are beginning to catch on, a sign that shoe sales are headed higher. Sales in the basketball category have grown at double digits for the last three years. 
The company's close relationship with Nike has also helped fuel growth as the Swoosh has seen its own double-digit sales growth for the last several years. More than 60% of Foot Locker's sales comes from Nike products, and the company is Nike's most important vendor, representing close to 20% of its sales. That relationship enables Foot Locker to get exclusive Nike products, which have made it a winner with shoe-buyers. 
Smart strategyIndustry trends alone aren't what made Foot Locker into the $10 billion company it is today. Much of the credit goes to Ken Hicks, the CEO who guided the company from 2009 until retiring a year ago. Hicks took over when the chain was floundering through the recession and delivered what's now 21 straight quarters of comparable sales growth and a fivefold increase in earnings per share. 
He closed underperforming stores so that the company's footprint is actually smaller than it was when he took over, and invested in the remaining stores, creating synergies between the company's different chains, which include Six:02, FootAction, and Champs Sports. The stores have also become more unique by adding departments like House of Hoops, Puma Labs, and Adidas Collector Shops, which make the store a bigger draw than the product alone would. Hicks has also placed a special effort on keeping the product and the store experience fresh and new, remodeling stores and updating selections.





Foot Locker is the nation's biggest athletic footwear retailer, with over 3,000 stores worldwide, and its size and success have kept competitors like Dick's and Finish Line at bay. The company has set a goal of reaching $10 billion in sales by 2020, up from $7.5 billion last year, and increasing its sales per square foot by more than 20% to $600.
To do so, it plans to leverage many of the strategies that have already paid off: Growing the Six:02 brand for women, transforming stores, and bringing in higher-margin products. At a P/E of 17, the stock still carries just a modest valuation, especially for a company posting high-single-digit comps. If it can execute on its growth plan, the stock is sure to keep rising.

Traditional grocers like Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) were killed as investors worried Amazon would leverage its extensive Prime ecosystem to finally make WFM affordable.This week, the victims are sports retailers, with FL stock front and center.Only a day after Amazon launched Prime Wardrobe, Goldman Sachs put out a research note which said that Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is likely to start selling its products directly through Amazon. Foot Locker, Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE:DKS) and Hibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIBB) are all down sharply in response.It makes sense. The last two advantages brick-and-mortar sports retailers had (the in-store experience of trying things out, and a unique product line) are now slowly withering away. Not only can consumers now try out new sneakers before buying them from the convenience of their home, but it’s likely they’re also about to be able to grab Nike from the most ubiquitous e-tailer out there, making sports retailers obsolete.Or are they?  7 Large-Cap Stocks That Should Go Private  I argue that this dip is actually a great buying opportunity for FL stock. Here’s why.Why You Should Buy FL StockPrime Wardrobe and the potential of Nike selling through Amazon will hurt Foot Locker’s business, but only marginally. The opportunity here is that the stock is being priced for a cataclysmic change in operating performance.That just won’t happen.Investors should remember that much unlike other retailers, Foot Locker has successfully navigated its way through the retail carnage over the past several years. While other retailers have struggled to be comps-positive, Foot Locker’s comps have been rising in the mid-single-digit range. While other retailers have seen margins compress dramatically due to heavy discounting, Foot Locker’s gross margins have been stable around 33%-35%.In other words, FL has managed to continue normal operations in an already exceedingly abnormal retail environment.Yes, that environment promises to become even more abnormal with Prime Wardrobe and Nike selling through Amazon, but those are actually rather small changes in the bigger picture of what’s going on in retail.FL shares, however, are acting like everything has changed dramatically — it hasn’t, which makes right now a buying opportunity.Bottom Line on FL StockFoot Locker shares now trade below 10 times earnings, and that’s simply unheard of in this stock. Moreover, that’s against expectations that earnings will grow by high single digits over the next few years, making the P/E even more of a bargain. Foot Locker also sports a decent war chest of more than $1 billion, big cash flows and a growing dividend that is suddenly throwing off a decent yield of about 2.7%.  Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Isn't a Buy With an Amazon Partnership, But...  I see support kicking in soon. At this compressed a multiple, with such a strong balance sheet and cash flow situation, all of the bad is priced in and then some.If the next couple of quarterly results show that things at Foot Locker are normal, expect FL stock to shoot higher in a collective gasp of relief.The risk-reward asymmetry lies in favor of bulls at these levels.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, DKS, FL, KR and NKE.More From InvestorPlace  Apple Inc.

Finding it in a store is impossible because the search engine does not search for the nearest store with inventory, it just tells you the 6 closest stores to the entered zip code.  I used the chat service and was disappointed with the reply that I would have to just enter zip codes or cities and look for stores that had them.  That is unreasonable and this product should not be advertised online as such.  I did search for major cities in the US to no avail.
