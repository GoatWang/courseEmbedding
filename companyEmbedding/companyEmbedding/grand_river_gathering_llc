Copans Rd STE G6, Pompano Beach, FL 33064 - 800.857.8721 Toll-Free                 Summit Midstream Partners LP: Why This Traditional MLP May Not Be Worth Your While - Summit Midstream Partners (NYSE:SMLP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Summit Midstream Partners LP: Why This Traditional MLP May Not Be Worth Your WhileJan. 8.13 | About: Summit Midstream (SMLP) Elliott Gue Research analyst, dividend investing, oil & gas, master limited partnershipsEnergy & Income AdvisorAmid the recent influx of MLPs that own nontraditional assets or pay a variable distribution, Summit Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: SMLP), which went public on Sept. 27, 2012, is a bit of a throwback: a midstream operator that owns gathering and processing assets and pays a regular quarterly distribution.
The fledgling publicly traded partnership traces its lineage back to fall 2009, when members of the management team and private-equity outfit Energy Capital Partners formed Summit Midstream Partners LLC to build a portfolio of midstream energy assets in North America. In the third quarter of 2011, this group sold a 9 percent interest in the concern to GE Energy Financial Services.
Summit Midstream Partners LP owns two operating entities: DFW Midstream Services LLC and Grand River Gathering LLC.
DFW Midstream Services
The MLP's privately owned antecedent acquired the DFW Midstream system-a network of small-diameter gathering pipelines that connect wellhead production to larger pipelines and processing systems-in the Barnett Shale from Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE: CHK) and a subsidiary of Energy Future Holdings Corp.
In subsequent years, Summit Midstream Partners LLC expanded the gathering network to its current capacity of 410 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Management expects nameplate throughput to expand to 450 million cubic feet per day when additional compressors and looping pipelines come onstream in the first quarter of 2013.
This operation has little direct exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, thanks to long-term gathering agreements that also include remaining minimum volume commitments with an average of 138 million cubic feet per day remaining. An acreage dedication of about 100,000 acres with anchor customer Chesapeake Energy guarantees that any wells the operators sinks in the area of mutual interest will be connected to Summit Midstream Partners LP's DFW gathering system.
Volumes transported on these pipelines increased 16.9 percent from the first half of 2012 to 380 million cubic feet per day. Earlier in 2012, Chesapeake Energy and other operators had restricted production from existing wells in response to the ultra-depressed natural-gas prices that followed the no-show winter of 2011-12. Much of this upside stemmed from some operators removing curtailments on their existing wells to take advantage of the recovery in the price of natural gas. Atlas Resource Partners LP (NYSE: ARP), for example, stepped up work-over operations on acreage acquired from Carrizo Oil & Gas (NSDQ: CRZO) earlier this year.

Nevertheless, Summit Midstream Partners LP estimates that roughly 25 percent of the 312 wells connected to the DFW system were either shut-in or significantly curtailed at the end of the third quarter. A further recovery in the price of natural gas would likely prompt operators to ramp up output from these wells. Management has also highlighted plans to connect four pad sites operated by the privately held Beacon Exploration & Production in the coming year, a move that should bolster throughput and help to offset natural well declines.
However, drilling activity will likely remain constrained. Summit Midstream Partners LP's gathering pipelines are concentrated in the southeast portion of Tarrant County-the heart of the gas-producing Barnett Shale. The newly listed MLP's investor relations team has touted this area as the "core of the core of the Barnett," noting that the DFW system services two of the play's most prolific wells, based on their peak production rates.
But upstream operators have scaled back drilling activity in the portions of the Barnett Shale that primarily produce natural gas, preferring the superior economics offered by liquids-rich basins such as the Bakken Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin. (See Breaking Down the US Onshore Rig Count.) Accordingly, the active rig count in Tarrant County has tumbled from 24 at the beginning of the year to about eight in the second week of December.

In a conference call to discuss third-quarter results, Summit Midstream Partners LP's CEO, Steven Newby, told analysts that the firm expects operators to run one rig in the MLP's service area in the coming year and emphasized that any upside would come from producers restoring output from so-called "wafflers"-existing wells that have been curtailed or shut in. Over the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2012, management expects the DFW Midstream system to account for 54 percent of the MLP's revenue.

Grand River Gathering LLC
In October 2011, Summit Midstream Partners LP's predecessor acquired 276 miles of gathering pipelines, now called the Grand River system, in western Colorado's Piceance Basin from EnCana Corp (NYSE: ECA) for USD590.2 million. Grand River comprises three distinct systems-Mamm Creek, Orchard and South Parachute-each of which connect to third-party pipelines that transport output to Enterprise Products Partners LP's (NYSE: EPD) processing plant in Meeker, Colo.
In connection with this deal, the MLP inked long-term gathering agreements with anchor customer EnCana on each of these three systems and assumed six contracts with five other producers.
The majority of the volumes transported on this gathering network come from the Mesaverde, a shallow formation that yields natural gas and significant quantities of NGLs. In the third quarter of 2012, the Grand River system averaged throughput of 578 million cubic feet per day, down 1.7 percent from the first half of 2012.
Much of this drop in production stemmed from temporary issues that affected about 20 million cubic feet per day of production in the Mamm Creek area. Throughput on the Orchard system will also continue its gradual decline unless EnCana and other producers step up drilling in the dry-gas portions of the Mancos and Niobrara Shale-an unlikely prospect in the current pricing environment. Management highlighted a recent joint venture between EnCana and steelmaker Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE) as a potential growth driver for volumes in the Piceance Basin.
Distribution Outlook
With an asset base that's focused on two out-of-favor basins, Summit Midstream Partners LP lacks significant opportunities for organic growth. That being said, we don't expect the MLP to have any challenges delivering its minimum quarterly distribution of $0.40 per unit; excluding one-time charges, the firm would have covered this payout by about 1.1 times in the most recent quarter.
The terms of the partnership agreement also provide a degree of protection to unitholders in the MLP's first few years of operations. Summit Midstream Partners LLC own a 2 percent general partner interest in the MLP, as well as common units representing a 19.1 percent stake in the limited partner (LP) and subordinated units that amount to a 50 percent interest in the LP. These subordinated units are only entitled to receive a distribution after each common unit has received the minimum quarterly payout and any arrearage from prior quarters.

The subordinated units will convert to common stock once the MLP disburses at least the minimum quarterly distribution to each LP unitholder and makes the required payment to its general partner for twelve consecutive three-month periods. Alternatively, this conversion can occur if the MLP pays out 150 percent of its minimum annual distribution (equivalent to $2.40 per unit) over a period of four consecutive quarters.
Not only does this structure increase the likelihood that Summit Midstream Partners LP will be able to meet its minimum distribution to unitholders at this early stage in its life span, but the arrangement also incentivizes the sponsors to grow the MLP's distributable cash flow.
About a month after Summit Midstream Partners LP's initial public offering, the MLP's parent closed the USD207 million acquisition of ETC Canyon Pipeline LLC from Energy Transfer Partners LP (NYSE: ETP). This deal involved 1,600 miles of gathering pipelines and two gas-processing facilities that serve producers in the Piceance Basin in Colorado and Uinta Basin in Utah.
In addition to the fee-based gathering agreements that the parent assumed as part of the acquisition, the firm inked two long-term deals to provide midstream services to WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) and Black Hills Corp's (NYSE: BKH) exploration and production subsidiary.
As part of these deals, the parent company will build additional gathering capacity to connect WPX Energy's new production in the Rifle, Colo., area and construct a processing plant and related infrastructure to support Black Hills' planned development of the liquids-rich Niobrara and Mancos formations.
Asked about potential drop-down transactions involving these newly acquired assets, Summit Midstream Partners LP's CEO indicated that such a move wouldn't take place until the parent completed certain capacity expansions and midstream projects-a hitch that would push any deal back to the end of 2013.
Although we're less than enamored with Summit Midstream Partners LP's current asset base, eventual drop-down transactions from the MLP's sponsors should drive distribution growth. Capital Partners has indicated that Summit Midstream Partners LP will be its primary platform for growth in the midstream space. The outfit also has about $350 million in liquidity on its credit facility that could be plowed into an acquisition.

With an indicated yield of about 8 percent, units of Summit Midstream Partners LP offer a sufficient current return to compensate for an existing asset base that offers scant opportunity for growth. Prospective investors should understand that an investment in this fledgling MLP represents a bet that management will pursue an attractive slate of growth projects.

Grand River Gathering Announces Unaudited Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Operating Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Aug 6 15
Grand River Gathering announced unaudited earnings results for the second quarter and operating results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015. EBITDA totaled $26.9 million for the second quarter of 2015, up 0.3% over the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 also benefitted from the aforementioned decision to discontinue allocating certain corporate overhead expenses beginning in the first quarter of 2015.

Volume throughput on the Grand River system decreased by 10.1% to 604 MMcf/d from the second quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of anchor customer's continued suspension of drilling activities in the basin. The impact of these volume declines was partially offset by higher MVC shortfall payment adjustments associated with certain of customers' gas gathering agreements. 

For the six months, average daily throughput was 610 MMcf/d against 667 MMcf/d a year ago.

DALLAS, March 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:   SMLP) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Grand River Gathering, LLC ("Grand River"), has closed the previously announced acquisition of Red Rock Gathering Company, LLC ("Red Rock") from a subsidiary of Summit Midstream Partners, LLC ("Summit Investments") for total cash consideration of $305.0 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments.  The Red Rock drop down was financed with the net proceeds from SMLP's primary equity offering of 5.3 million common units and borrowings under SMLP's revolving credit facility.  
Red Rock is a natural gas gathering and processing system located in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado and eastern Utah with approximately 1,480 miles of low-pressure and high-pressure pipeline, 54,000 horsepower of compression and two processing plants with 50 MMcf/d of processing capacity.  The Red Rock system gathers and processes natural gas, primarily under fee-based contracts, for more than 55 producer customers.  Natural gas on the Red Rock system interconnects with downstream pipelines serving Enterprise Products Partners L.P.'s ("Enterprise") Meeker Natural Gas Processing Plant, Williams Partners L.P.'s Northwest Pipeline system, and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P.'s TransColorado Pipeline system.  Processed natural gas liquids from the Red Rock system are injected into Enterprise's Mid-America Pipeline system.
Red Rock's largest customers include subsidiaries of WPX Energy, Inc., Encana Corporation, Noble Energy, Inc., Black Hills Corporation, Piceance Energy LLC, and Ursa Resources Group II LLC.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, volume throughput on the Red Rock system averaged 148 MMcf/d and more than 80.0% of its revenue was generated from fee-based services.  
Pro forma for the Red Rock drop down, SMLP will continue to generate more than 90.0% of its revenue under long-term, fee-based contracts and will have over 4.2 Tcf of minimum volume commitments through 2026.
The terms of the Red Rock drop down transaction were approved by the board of directors of SMLP's general partner and by the board's conflicts committee, which consists entirely of independent directors.  The conflicts committee engaged Evercore Partners to act as its independent financial advisor and to render a fairness opinion, and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, LLP acted as its legal advisor.
Because of the common control aspects in a drop down transaction, the Red Rock acquisition is deemed a transaction between entities under common control and, as such, will be accounted for on an "as if pooled" basis for all periods in which common control existed.  As a result, SMLP's financial results will retrospectively include Red Rock's financial results for all periods ending after October 23, 2012.  
About Summit Midstream Partners, LP
SMLP is a growth-oriented limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in North America.  SMLP currently provides natural gas gathering, treating and compression services pursuant to long-term, primarily fee-based natural gas gathering agreements with our customers and counterparties in four unconventional resource basins: (i) the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in northern West Virginia; (ii) the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations in northwestern North Dakota; (iii) the Fort Worth Basin, which includes the Barnett Shale formation in north-central Texas; and (iv) the Piceance Basin, which includes the Mesaverde formation as well as the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations in western Colorado.  SMLP owns and operates 2,285 miles of pipeline and 236,580 horsepower of compression.  SMLP is headquartered in Dallas, TX with regional corporate offices in Houston, TX, Denver, CO and Atlanta, GA.

This press release includes certain statements concerning expectations for the future that are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements contain known and unknown risks and uncertainties (many of which are difficult to predict and beyond management's control) that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from anticipated or projected results.  An extensive list of specific material risks and uncertainties affecting us is contained in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 10, 2014 and as amended and updated from time to time. Any forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and SMLP undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events.
