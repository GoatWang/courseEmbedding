"I recently purchased a garden home in the SugarTree subdivision in Versailles, Kentucky and
    moved in approximately one month ago. My purpose in writing is to commend you and your company
    on the professional performance of your sales manager. I took quite a while and a
    number of visits before making a decision to buy (with lots of questions). During that process and after
    moving in, and continuing into the present, the sales manager could not have been more positive, pleasant,
    professional and thorough. There was nothing I could ask of him during the whole process that wasn't
    taken care of quickly and willingly. I've had a business of my own for over 30 years with approximately 25 employees, so I can
    usually evaluate an employee accurately after a short time. He is a valuable asset and a credit to your
    organization."
    - Frederick J. Seitz
