The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Third Party Trade Group Releases White-Label Brokerage API For Australian Market












This article is a company-provided press release and although ProgrammableWeb may have edited it, it cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statements within. If you have questions regarding the information below, please contact the company that issued the press release.



 

This article is a company-provided press release and ProgrammableWeb cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statements within. If you have questions regarding the information below, please contact the company that issued the press release.
New York fintech start-up Third Party Trade Group Inc. (“TPT”) today announced the launch of a new low-cost, white-labeled, API-driven US brokerage service to empower the world to invest, from anywhere, on any device. TPT is launching the service in collaboration with Apex Clearing Corporation (“Apex”), a leading technology-enabled clearing and execution firm.
Starting with Australia, the service, provided by SEC registered FINRA and SIPC member broker-dealer Third Party Trade LLC, will be made available on a wholesale basis to ASX market participants, AFSL holders and authorized representatives, providing a new and exciting opportunity for Australian self-directed investors to invest in the companies that create products they care about and use everyday.
TPT customers will have the ability to easily and securely integrate with its REST-based API platform, supported by Apex’s innovative clearing and execution platform, to provide the full suite of services through their existing client portal in real-time, including account creation, funding, order management, market data and alerts.
Commenting on the launch, TPT Founder & CEO Michael Giles, an Australian living in New York, said, “Many of the products and services Australians interact with everyday are created by companies that are not listed in Australia and therefore not available as an investment opportunity for the average self-directed investor. Investors deserve the opportunity to gain exposure to these high growth companies in a low-cost, easy to use and fully integrated platform which TPT provides.”
Giles further commented, “We built our technology to cater to every kind of product concept, pricing model and delivery method. The possibilities are endless.”
Danny Rosenthal, CEO of Apex added, “We look forward to working with Michael and his team as we bring our unique clearing and execution technology to help TPT seamlessly operate their business and put more control in the hands of their customers. We believe they have the right concept at the right time and hope they will be very successful.”
Australian financial services providers are encouraged to contact the company to discuss creating a custom solution and introduce new revenue opportunities to their existing business.
