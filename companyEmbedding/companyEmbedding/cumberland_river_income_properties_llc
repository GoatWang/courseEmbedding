A Real Estate Investment Location is a neighborhood or a set of neighborhoods where there are investment properties that produce positive cash flow after deducting all monthly expenses, including mortgage payments. 
Real Estate Investment Locations

 
HomeUnion has identified Real Estate Investment Locations that meet the cash flow requirement as well as a number of other criteria such as:

Employment
Median income
Area comps
Access to mass transit
Quality of schools
Employer diversity
Average tenancy 

We determines if a neighborhood fits the definition through extensive use of our proprietary algorithms and ‘boots on the ground’- some of these local property managers have more than 20 years in their location.
Properties tend to be in middle-class locations. High end neighborhoods don’t provide adequate cash flow, and lower priced neighborhoods lack a stable tenant base. We look for Return on Investment for our clients; which means finding properties with high rent-to-purchase-price ratios in economically viable areas.
And Now, Investing in Real Estate is As Simple
With HomeUnion it’s now easy to invest in real estate. You invest, we do the rest. Tell us your investment goals, and we’ll help you build a real estate investment plan to match your goals. Our experts will take care of the entire acquisition process as well as the ongoing management of the property. We’ll also provide you with market intelligence for buy, hold or sell decisions. Our goals are to maximize your returns, protect your assets and provide you with 100% transparency in the process. Learn how you can identify investment properties within a good investment location neighborhood. Download our Definitive Guide to Investment Properties.

Benefits of Real Estate Investing










MONTHLY CASH FLOW
HomeUnion provides a unique cash flow investment opportunity into single-family rental homes where the primary return on investment comes from tenants paying rent.









EQUITY GROWTH
HomeUnion identifies properties where the monthly rent is at least 1% of the purchase price.  With these properties, you can build equity on your investment property without paying a monthly mortgage payment.









APPRECIATION
Properties identified through HomeUnion's extensive Top Down property identification process, although not guaranteed, are predicted to increase in value over time.








Benefits of Investing with HomeUnion






High Yield ROI
100% Ownership of Property


360 Degree Support
Hassle Free Asset Management


Ease of Ownership
Diversification from the Stock Market












“I was wary of investing remotely, but HomeUnion’s research helped me make an informed decision. My property is generating good returns, and with HomeUnion’s help, I can continue to buy good cash flow homes around the country.”



Ramya Subramanian






“Thanks to HomeUnion, I now have direct, leveraged exposure to real estate through a diverse portfolio in multiple locations throughout the country. The properties cash flow and the process is streamlined. I trust their experience.”



Dr. Eric H., MD
