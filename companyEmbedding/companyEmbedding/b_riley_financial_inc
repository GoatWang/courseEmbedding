	For a company such as ours which is in a growth phase, we appreciate B. Riley coming to the table with their A-Team, who bring over 30 years of banking experience.  This is in stark contrast to larger firms who do not bring this kind of talent to smaller deals.  We’ve worked with B. Riley since the late 1990s, and they were integral in helping build one of my prior companies, Titan Corp., which was successfully sold to L3 Communications for approximately $2 billion dollars.  We’ve found B. Riley to be relationship oriented and not transaction driven.   For Kratos, the B. Riley team has represented us in three successful capital raises and two advisory engagements in the past 12 months.  Each time, they have consistently exceeded our expectations. This offering was completed in 36 hours which is testimony to the strength of the existing Kratos shareholder base, the strength of B. Riley’s institutional relationships and the quality of our company’s fundamentals.


			Eric DeMarco
President and CEO
			Kratos Defense & Security Solutions

											Business Continuity Plan
										
									



Business Continuity Plan

	B. Riley has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.

	Contacting Us – In case of an emergency, you should attempt to contact our home office in Los Angeles, CA first. If you are unable to reach someone in Los Angeles, you should attempt to contact someone in our other offices.

	Our Business Continuity Plan – We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible.

	The plan addresses, among other things: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business. The plan also covers disruptions that may affect each office across the country.

	Varying Disruptions – Significant business disruptions and its degree of severity can vary in their size and scope. We plan to continue business operations, transfer operations to our clearing firm if necessary, and notify you through our web site or our customer emergency number, (310) 966-1444 on how to contact us and the time frame that we expect to resume business operations. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customer’s prompt access to their funds and securities.

	If you have questions about our business continuity planning, please contact the Compliance Department at (310) 966-1444 or email .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).

		The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements, and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.

		The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.

											Extended Hours Trading Disclosure
										
									



Extended Hours Trading Disclosure

	This disclosure is provided for customers who engage in trading outside normal market hours.  Such trading involves certain risks explained below.


Risk of Lower Liquidity - Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

Risk of Higher Volatility - Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Changing Prices - The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours, or upon the opening of the next morning. As a result, you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Unlinked Markets - Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system.

Risk of News Announcements - Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular market hours. Similarly, important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular market hours. In extended hours trading, these announcements may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, it may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.

Risk of Wider Spreads - The spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security.

Risk of Lack of Calculation or Dissemination of Underlying Index Value or Intra-day Indicative Value (“IIV”) - For certain Derivative Securities Products (such as exchange-traded funds, ETFs), an updated underlying index value or IIV may not be calculated or publicly disseminated in extended trading hours. Since the underlying index value and IIV are not calculated or widely disseminated during the pre-market and post-market sessions, an investor who is unable to calculate implied values for certain Derivative Securities Products in those sessions may be at a disadvantage to market professionals.


	 





										
											FINRA BrokerCheck
										
									



FINRA BrokerCheck

	Created by FINRA in 1988, and formerly known as the Public Disclosure Program, FINRA BrokerCheck provides investors with an easy, free way to learn about the professional background, business practices, and conduct of FINRA registered firms and their brokers. To request information under this program, visit the FINRA Web site at http://brokercheck.finra.org, or call (800) 289-9999. Through this internet site or hotline, you can request a public report of background information on FINRA registered firms and their brokers. This report reflects information provided by the broker, the firms, and regulators as part of the securities industry’s registration and licensing process.

	Should you have any complaints or disputes relating to your account please contact BRC’s Compliance Department at 310-966-1444, by fax to 310-966-1448 or by email to .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).





										
											Fully Paid Lending
										
									



Fully Paid Lending

	Retail customers with a minimum of $250,000 in assets in their B. Riley accounts may be eligible to participate in a fully-paid lending program offered by our clearing firm.  In a “fully paid” transaction you can lend a specific security to our clearing firm and in return you will receive collateral in the form of cash & securities held at a custodial bank.  In addition, you receive an interest rate-based fee.  Participation in this program is optional and requires the completion of additional paperwork.  Please note that there are risks associated with participation in this program some of which include:


Fully-paid securities on loan are not covered under the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970.

Under the securities lending agreement you relinquish your ability to exercise voting rights.

Fully paid securities on loan are no longer eligible for margin treatment or buying power calculations.

Securities that pay dividends will be paid as “cash-in-lieu” which may have different taxable consequences than receipt of actual dividends.

											Funding Your Retail Account
										
									



Funding Your Retail Account

	Personal checks and wire transfers are the only form of monetary deposits that will be accepted into your retail brokerage account.  All incoming checks or wires from 3rd parties must be confirmed with the client at the time of deposit to determine the business reason behind the 3rd party deposit.  B. Riley reserves the right to refuse any deposit.





										
											Held or Not Held Orders
										
									



Held or Not Held Orders

	When you place an order with your sales representative, you may specify that your order is handled on either a “held” or “not held” basis. A “not held” order means that you have given B. Riley discretion as to the price and time of execution of your order. If given a “held” order, B. Riley will not have discretion on handling your order and must execute it at the prevailing market price; or, if it’s a “held” limit order, any execution will take place at the limit price or better, if available.

	As “not held” orders give B. Riley the flexibility to work your order to seek to obtain the best execution reasonably available under the prevailing circumstances, your orders will be treated as “not held” unless we are specifically instructed to treat the order differently. Please note that, under FINRA Rules, a “not held” order does not have price protection. Consequently, there is no Limit Order Protection (i.e. no Manning obligation) for these orders and B. Riley is not required to match incoming market orders with unexecuted better-priced limit orders. Nonetheless, any purchase and sale transactions must be consistent with our efforts to provide best execution of your orders. Please notify your sales representative at the time you place your order if you wish your order to be treated other than “not held”.





										
											Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)
										
									



Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)

	Pursuant to FINRA Rules 5130 & 5131 (the Rules), B. Riley may not sell or cause to be sold a new issue (as defined in the Rules; generally, initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of equity securities) to any account in which a restricted person holds a beneficial interest unless the account qualifies for a general exemption under the Rule. In addition, there is a restriction that applies to sales to executive officers or directors of a public company or covered non-public company.  

	B. Riley requires retail account holders sign and return an IPO Certification annually indicating whether or not their account is eligible to purchase IPO shares in accordance with the Rule. In addition, in connection with any new issue, retail account holders hereby represent that they will not act as a finder (i.e., a person who receives compensation for identifying potential investors in an offering) or in a fiduciary capacity to any managing underwriter of any new issue and that they shall notify B. Riley immediately in the event that such representation ceases to be true and correct.  IPO Certifications can obtained from and returned to B. Riley’s Operations Department by fax to 310-966-1448 or by email to .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).





										
											Instant Messaging
										
									



Instant Messaging

	Please note that any instant message sent from or received by B. Riley personnel is subject to archiving, monitoring and production to third parties as required by applicable rules, regulations and law. Instant messages and emails may be reviewed by someone other than the intended recipient.





										
											Institutional Suitability Certification
										
									



Institutional Suitability Certification

	Institutional Suitability Certification: Affirmative Indication of Exercise of Independent Judgment (Pursuant to FINRA Rule 2111)

	In connection with any recommended (as defined in FINRA rules), transaction or investment strategy by B. Riley, you have acknowledged on behalf of your Institution that:


		It is an Institutional Account as defined in FINRA Rule 4512(c);

		It (1) is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to all transactions and investment strategies involving a security or securities; and (2) will exercise independent judgment in evaluating the recommendations of B. Riley or its associated persons, unless it has otherwise notified B. Riley in writing;

		It will notify B. Riley if anything in this Certification ceases to be true;


	You have acknowledged that the above statements are accurate but do not waive any rights afforded under U.S. federal or state securities laws, including without limitation, any rights under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

	This shall apply with respect to all recommended transactions and investment strategies involving securities that are entered into by your Institutional Account as named on the B. Riley Institutional New Account Form, whether for the account of such Institutional Account or for the account of any beneficial owner that has delegated decision making authority to such Institutional Account.





										
											Investment Advisors with Subaccounts
										
									



Investment Advisors with Subaccounts

	Investment Advisors may request the establishment of certain subaccounts with B. Riley for the purpose of executing transactions that will clear or settle at another financial institution.  The limited information that is provided to B. Riley is to be used primarily to assist the Investment Advisor with its recordkeeping and to hold positions for a limited duration to facilitate the transfer of assets to another financial institution.  All transactions in these subaccounts will be initiated by individuals authorized to transact on behalf of the Investment Advisor, there will be no interaction with the beneficial owners of the accounts, and in fact the beneficial owners shall have no direct control over subaccounts opened with B. Riley.

	Investment Advisors that maintain subaccounts with B. Riley attest that they have in their files client authorizations to direct orders to B. Riley, in a fully discretionary manner, or otherwise, for all accounts for whom they may place orders through B. Riley.  Investment Advisors are authorized to place orders with B. Riley to purchase and sell securities, to deliver and receive securities and to request and receive payment of funds on behalf of each account.  In lieu of furnishing B. Riley with specific evidence of authority in connection with each account in which an order with respect to securities is given to B. Riley, the Investment Advisor agrees to indemnify and hold B. Riley harmless in the event that any such account should make claim against B. Riley that its execution of any order, on the basis of the Investment Advisor’s instructions, was without authority. 

	Furthermore, B. Riley may rely upon the Investment Advisor’s assurance that it has examined any trust instruments, corporate resolutions or other authorizing documents, and is satisfied that the person or persons who signed such document(s) were themselves properly authorized by the entity they represent.  Moreover, based upon the review of such documents and other relevant information regarding its clients, the Investment Advisor is satisfied that any investment or investment decision executed through B. Riley is suitable for the relevant client.  Investment Advisor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless B. Riley in the event that any such account should make claim against B. Riley that any investment or investment decision was not suitable.
	 





										
											Large Trader Identification (LTID)
										
									



Large Trader Identification (LTID)

	In the event that you or your account is considered to be a large trader as defined by Rule 13h-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 you must provide B. Riley with your large trader identification number ("LTID").  Should you no longer qualify as a large trader you must notify B. Riley's Operations Department at 310-966-1444 or via email to .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address).





										
											Limit Order Display
										
									



Limit Order Display

	The Limit Order Display Rule obligates the B. Riley (the "Firm") to reflect the price and full size of a customer's limit order (whether the Firm's customer or the customer of another broker-dealer) in the Firm's quote, if the order would improve the Firm's quote. The Rule applies to common stock, preferred stock, and convertible preferred stock. In addition, if the Firm's bid or offer is equal to the National Best Bid or Offer, the size of any customer limit order that equals the bid or offer and represents more than a de minimis change in size must be displayed. The SEC defines de minimis as size that is equal to or less than 10% of the Firm's quotation size.

	One exception to this Rule allows for customers to request that their limit orders not be displayed, either at the time of the order or prior thereto, pursuant to agreements with our customers. BRC will treat your limit order as “not displayed” unless specifically told to display the order. Please notify your sales representative at the time you place your order if you wish your limit order to be displayed. 





										
											Margin Disclosure
										
									



Margin Disclosure

	B. Riley is furnishing this disclosure to you to provide some basic facts about purchasing securities on margin, and to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin account. Before trading stocks in a margin account, you should carefully review this Margin Disclosure and the margin agreement provided to you by B. Riley.

	When you purchase securities, you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow part of the purchase price from your brokerage firm. If you choose to borrow funds in connection with your account, you will be required to open a margin account which will be carried by B. Riley*. The securities purchased in such an account are collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your margin account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan. And, as a result, B. Riley is required to take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts, in order to maintain the required level of equity in the account.

	It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:


		You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. A decline in the value of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to the firm that has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities or assets in your account(s).

		Your brokerage firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). If the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements or B. Riley's higher "house" requirements, B. Riley may be required to sell the securities or other assets in any of your accounts to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any short fall in the account after such a sale.

		Your brokerage firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. Some investors mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that the firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case. A brokerage firm may attempt to notify customers of margin calls, but it is not required to do so. However, even if your B. Riley has contacted you and provided a specific date by which you can meet a margin call, B. Riley can still take necessary steps to protect its financial interests, including immediately selling assets without notice to you.

		You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the margin loan, B. Riley has the right to decide which security or other asset to sell in order to protect its interests.

		Your brokerage firm may move securities held in your cash account to your margin account and pledge or rehypothecate the transferred securities. Any such pledge or rehypothecation may result in a benefit to B. Riley and result in your becoming a general unsecured creditor of your brokerage firm with respect to the securities so pledged or rehypothecated.

		The firm can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice. These changes in firm policy often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause your firm to liquidate or sell securities or other assets in your account(s).

		You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. While an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions, a customer does not have a right to the extension.


	*B. Riley ("Brokerage Firm") has entered into a fully disclosed clearing agreement with National Financial Services LLC (“Clearing Firm”) pursuant to which Clearing Firm may perform certain processing, clearing, custodial, and financing functions for your brokerage firm with respect to your account. Clearing Firm extends the margin credit to you and carries your margin loan. Clearing Firm is a beneficiary of your representations, warranties, acknowledgments, and covenants in the margin agreement (including, without limitation, your authorizations, indemnifications, waivers, and releases) to the same extent as if they were made directly by you to the Clearing Firm. The Clearing Firm, in its own name and for its own benefit, is entitled to exercise and enforce directly against you the margin agreement, all other rights granted to your brokerage firm, and the rights of the “firm” and “brokerage firm” described in this disclosure statement.

	 





										
											Net Trading
										
									



Net Trading

	B. Riley is a market maker in a number of NASDAQ and OTC Markets securities; as such we have the capability to execute orders on a “net” basis. A "net" transaction is defined as a principal transaction in which a market maker, after having received an order to buy (sell) an equity security, purchases (sells) the equity security at one price (to/from another broker-dealer or another customer) and then sells to (buys from) the customer at a different price.

	For our Institutional Customers, unless instructed otherwise at the time the order has been placed, B. Riley may treat your order as a “net” transaction. Trades will be confirmed on a net basis with the following understanding: The price per share or other unit of trading will reflect a net price which includes the addition of any mark-up for purchase transactions or the deduction of any mark-down for sale transactions, where mark-ups or markdowns apply. In the event a transaction includes a commission, the net price will reflect any added commission for purchases or deducted commissions for sales. If the above is not consistent with your desire for confirming trades on a net basis, please notify your sales representative at the time you place your order that you do not want your order to be transacted on a “net” basis.

	For our Non-Institutional Customers, such as those with retail accounts, if you would like to effect a transaction on a “net” basis you must provide written consent to B. Riley on an order-by-order basis prior to B. Riley executing any portion of said order. All orders that are not transacted on a “net” basis may be imposed a commission.





										
											Payment for Order Flow
										
									



Payment for Order Flow

	Remuneration in the form of cash, liquidity rebates, order swapping or other reciprocal arrangements may be received by B. Riley for directing orders to specific brokers and dealers or market centers for execution. When such remuneration is received it is considered compensation to the firm. The source and amount of such remuneration, if any, will be furnished to you upon written request. Absent specific instructions from customers, all orders received that the subject of payment for order flow are directed to the source that offers customers the best execution.

	Notwithstanding the previous paragraph regarding payment for order flow, B. Riley selects certain market centers to provide execution of over-the-counter and exchange-listed securities transactions which agree to accept orders, transmitted electronically up to a specified size, and to execute them at or better than the national best bid or offer (NBBO). On certain larger orders, or if the designated market centers do not make a market in the subject security, B. Riley directly contacts market centers to obtain an execution. The designated market centers to which orders are automatically routed are selected based on the consistent high quality of their executions in one or more market segments and their ability to provide opportunities for executions at prices superior to the NBBO.





										
											Penny Stocks (Low-Priced Securities)

											Short Selling and “Locates” of Borrowing Securities
										
									



Short Selling and “Locates” of Borrowing Securities

	Subject to certain limited exemptions, before placing a short sale, you are required to borrow, arrange to borrow, or otherwise have reasonable grounds to believe that the security sold short can be borrowed for delivery by settlement date. Prior to executing a short sale order on your behalf B. Riley will require confirmation from you that a borrow has been secured and from whom. This process is commonly referred to as “obtaining a locate.” A locate is an indication that, as of the time the locate is obtained, B. Riley has reasonable grounds to believe that securities will be available for borrowing on the settlement date. A locate is not a guarantee that securities will actually be available for lending and delivery on the settlement date or that the lender will not thereafter require the return of the borrowed securities at any time. If a sufficient quantity of securities is not available from our clearing firm’s inventory, B. Riley or our clearing firm may, among other things, contact third-party lenders to ascertain whether they have securities available for lending. If B. Riley or our clearing firm determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a sufficient quantity of securities is borrowable, B. Riley may proceed to execute the short sale on behalf of your account. If B. Riley or its clearing firm is unable to determine that the shares can be borrowed, the order will not proceed at that time.

	If the order is executed and the securities are not available for borrowing for any reason by the settlement date, you as the seller will “fail to deliver” to the purchaser. A purchaser or securities lender may, in addition to other remedies and at any time after the giving of any required notice, buy-in the securities that were not timely delivered and you will be responsible for all losses and costs of the buy-in. You agree to be responsible for any cost or loss B. Riley and/or our clearing firm may incur in sourcing and maintaining the borrow, or the cost our clearing firm may incur in obtaining the securities if the clearing firm is unable to borrow such securities. This includes costs associated with borrowed stock that is “easy to borrow” and later determined “hard to borrow” as determined by our clearing firm. You appoint our clearing firm, National Financial Services LLC, as agent to complete all such transactions and authorize our clearing firm to make advances and expend monies as are required. With respect to short positions maintained by you over a corporate action record date, our clearing firm will, on the relevant payment date for such corporate action, if any, charge your account for money or property equal in value to the cost of such corporate action attributable to your short position, including the costs of any lost tax benefits for the lenders. You acknowledge that our clearing firm may source a borrow of securities from its own proprietary accounts or from customer margin shares. You are ultimately responsible for the delivery of securities on the settlement date, the consequences of a failure to deliver and the timely return of securities borrowed on your behalf and all costs associated with such borrowings, including costs relating to any corporate actions.





										
											SIPC
										
									



SIPC

	B. Riley is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC’). SIPC plays an important role in the overall system of investor protection in the United States by, in certain specified situations, restoring funds to investors with assets in the hands of bankrupt and otherwise financially troubled brokerage firms. As a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), funds are available to meet customer claims up to a ceiling of $500,000, including a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims.

	Additionally, securities in accounts carried by National Financial Services LLC ("NFS"), a Fidelity Investments company, are protected in accordance with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") up to $500,000 (including up to $250,000 for cash awaiting reinvestment).  NFS also has arranged for coverage above these limits.  Neither coverage protects against a decline in the market value of securities, nor does either coverage extend to certain securities that are considered ineligible for coverage.  For more details on SIPC, or to request a SIPC brochure, visit http://www.sipc.org or call 1-202-371-8300. 





										
											Trading Ahead of Customer Orders
										
									



Trading Ahead of Customer Orders

	While our internal policies generally prohibit B. Riley from executing principal orders when there is customer order on the same side of the market, there may be circumstances where this activity would be allowable.  As such we are required to disclose that as permissible under FINRA Rule 5320 B. Riley may trade a security on the same side of the market for its own account at a price that would satisfy a customer order for an “institutional account” or for orders of 10,000 shares or more (unless such orders are less than $100,000 in value).  Should you choose to opt in to the protections afforded in Rule 5320 for all or any portion of your order(s) please notify your sales representative at the time you place your order.

B. Riley to buy Wunderlich for $67 million
B. Riley Financial Inc.  announced Thursday an agreement to buy Memphis-based investment firm Wunderlich Securities in a deal valued at $67 million. Under terms of the deal, B. Riley's bid includes $36 million in cash, 1.9 million of its common stock and warrants to buy 820,000 common shares. B. Riley expects the deal to close in June 2017, and to add to 2017 earnings per share. "We believe now is an opportune time to build a fully-integrated brokerage firm to more fully capitalize on the current market conditions as well as be ideally positioned with greater capabilities, resources and distribution as opportunities arise," said B. Riley Chief Executive Bryant Riley. "On top of this, we see the cycle of active versus passive investing swinging back towards active management and believe the opportunity is now to begin investing for it." B. Riley's stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has tumbled 26% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.3%.

FBR & Co.'s board OKs special $7.61 dividend
Investment bank FBR & Co.  said late Friday its board of directors has declared a special cash dividend of $7.61 per common share. That special dividend is in connection with FBR's merger with B. Riley Financial Inc. , announced in February, and it is contingent upon the closing of the merger. The dividend is payable June 1 to shareholders of record May 30. Shares of FBR were flat in after-hours trading after ending the regular session down 0.6%.

B. Riley to buy Wunderlich for $67 million
B. Riley Financial Inc.  announced Thursday an agreement to buy Memphis-based investment firm Wunderlich Securities in a deal valued at $67 million. Under terms of the deal, B. Riley's bid includes $36 million in cash, 1.9 million of its common stock and warrants to buy 820,000 common shares. B. Riley expects the deal to close in June 2017, and to add to 2017 earnings per share. "We believe now is an opportune time to build a fully-integrated brokerage firm to more fully capitalize on the current market conditions as well as be ideally positioned with greater capabilities, resources and distribution as opportunities arise," said B. Riley Chief Executive Bryant Riley. "On top of this, we see the cycle of active versus passive investing swinging back towards active management and believe the opportunity is now to begin investing for it." B. Riley's stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has tumbled 26% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.3%.
