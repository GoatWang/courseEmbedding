Uncovering Opportunistic Value
Welcome to our Web site,Today securities markets appear more complex than ever before.  A flood-tide of new investment products has surfaced over the years, adding to the complexity.  With rapid social, economic and political changes taking place both here and abroad, the art of investing has become increasingly difficult. In 1986, we set ourselves up as an intentionally small group of professional investment managers, with the purpose of executing a sound investment strategy, tailored to the specific needs of each client. Mount Vernon Associates provides asset management services for pension funds, profit sharing plans, endowments, foundations, trusts and private investors.

Our Firm
Mount Vernon Associates is an independent investment management firm that is privately owned by its officers.  We manage financial assets for tax exempt institutions as well as taxable corporate and individual investors.  All investment decisions are jointly reviewed by our investment policy committee. Mount Vernon Associates' clients benefit from our top down approach to both equity and fixed income management.  We believe that superior performance is derived from the ability to recognize and respond to changes in the economy, the political arena, or developments within a company or an industry that will have a significant impact either positive or negative.  This requires the expertise, confidence and flexibility to make investment decisions before the market has the opportunity to react to the information.

Equity Management
THE INVESTMENT DECISIONBased on our economic outlook, we select those sectors and industries that will benefit from the particular phase of the economic cycle.  Our portfolio managers who are responsible for the specific industries then identify those companies having the strongest fundamentals within them.  After a company has passed the initial screenings, it is subjected to our quantitative analysis through the following criteria:Price to earnings ratio less than the S&P 500Expected earnings growth rate greater than S&P 500Return on equity greater than the S&P 500The price to book ratio less than S&P 500Dividend yield greater than S&P 500Conversely these criteria combine to form the basis of our sell discipline:The price to earnings ratio exceeds that of the S&P 500Relative expected earnings will be less than the S&P 500The return on equity is expected to falterThe financial security appears to be weakening

Uncovering Opportunistic Value
Welcome to our Web site,Today securities markets appear more complex than ever before.  A flood-tide of new investment products has surfaced over the years, adding to the complexity.  With rapid social, economic and political changes taking place both here and abroad, the art of investing has become increasingly difficult. In 1986, we set ourselves up as an intentionally small group of professional investment managers, with the purpose of executing a sound investment strategy, tailored to the specific needs of each client. Mount Vernon Associates provides asset management services for pension funds, profit sharing plans, endowments, foundations, trusts and private investors.
