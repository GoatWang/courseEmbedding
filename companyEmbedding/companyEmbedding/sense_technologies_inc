“I have used sophisticated instrumentation daily on hundreds of patients for over 30 years, and have used Pulstar for the last 3. Not only is PulStar repeatable at a very high level of accuracy, but it correlates closer to the precise radiographic measurements we use, examination findings and symptomatology… I am excited each day with the ease and comfort of use to my body and ears and the results we get… If you wish to feel like a chiropractic scientist and healer, PulStar is the technology of choice. I can say that if more knew of this technology, revolving doors would have to be installed in most Chiropractic offices.”
Brad Batchelor DC – Boone, NC









“You asked if the PulStar ‘really does what I said it does’.” Yes, it does. It’s a very versatile instrument in that it both evaluates and adjusts… the PulStar is at least as good as any other system of analysis and adjustment, and better than most. 90% of my practice is now instrument, and it has greatly reduced the physical and mental stress of practice. I wish I’d switched 5 or 10 years ago, because it would have saved me a lot of wear and tear.”

“When I learned of the PulStar and saw the confirmation of what was in the patient’s spine, and then was able to go in and adjust that precise area, and then go back and see that I had accomplished something, it was not only confidence-building for me after 30 plus years and the patient can see those results as well.”
James Davis DC – Wellsboro, PA

“Before, I did manual treatments. I tried to get patients to come as much as I could get them to come. Now I try to get patients out of pain as quick as I can, and get them out of my office as quick as I can. And, inevitably patients find their way back in my office because we give them such good results with the PulStar.”
Tom Marcuzzo DC – Omaha, NE

Had it come down to Kasich vs. Clinton, there's a fair chance I would have voted for Kasich. But the Republicans showed their true colors, and it's been very disheartening to see the progression of this presidency. I don't see how I'll ever be able to vote for members of the party, at least not for the next decade... no backbone, no morals, no nothing.Join the Conversation1 / 517.2k
