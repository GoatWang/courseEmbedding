  Home  Small Caps  Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIMX) Aiming At Autonomous Vehicle Market with New Sensor...     Small Caps  Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIMX) Aiming At Autonomous Vehicle Market with New Sensor Product  ByAdam Russell -December 28, 2016 326  Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter


 Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIMX), through its subsidiary Himax Imaging, has developed a new image sensor called UltraSenseIR. The product appears to have what it takes to get a socket in autonomous vehicles.
According to Himax, UltraSenseIR is a low noise, low power image sensor boasting quantum efficiency of more than 40%. Himax is portraying UltraSenseIR as an advanced sensor for enabling computer and machine vision. As such, sensor could find use in 3D cameras, pattern recognition and autonomous navigation.
One of the reasons Himax believes it has a great product for machine vision applications is that integrating existing sensors presents challenges on multiple fronts. UltraSenseIR, on the other hands, offers a way to overcome those challenges.
“With our breakthrough UltraSenseIR technology, Himax combines the advantages of our highly integrated, low power and low noise BSI sensor technologies with NIR and visible sensitivity in a very small 2.0-micron pixel size to enable high resolution computer vision and NIR imaging applications,” said Amit Mittra, CTO of Himax Imaging.
Himax’s UltraSenseIR operates at 30 frames per second with energy consumption below 140mW. Furthermore, Himax said its new image sensor is easy to program and integrate.
Autonomous vehicle market
The market for vehicles capable of driving themselves is forecast to be huge in the coming years as cities and automakers try to work out a solution to traffic congestion. Research firm IHS predicts that 21 million self-driving cars will be shipped by 2035.
Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) are some of the notable companies developing autonomous driving technologies.
Given the race to build smarter vehicles, the average number of sensors and chips used in autonomous vehicles is expected to increase and this should expand the market for products like Himax’s UltraSenseIR.
Himax stock rose 4.4% to $6.22 in the last session. But the stock is down 24% YTD.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Better Buy: Himax Technologies Inc. vs NVIDIA
Each of these semiconductor companies is betting on emerging technologies -- but one chipmaker has a better strategy for growth.











                Chris Neiger
            

                (TMFNewsie)



            
            Apr 8, 2017 at 12:16PM
            
            





The semiconductor sector can be a volatile space: Companies are constantly shifting their products, managing fast-paced product cycles, and offering race-to-the-bottom prices in order to win spots for their chips in the world's top devices. 
Those uncertainties can make the industry highly cyclical, and they make predicting which companies will perform well over the long term even more difficult. Investors seeking the best players have likely come across Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let's take a closer look at each, and attempt to figure out which one has the better long-term prospects.

Image source: Getty Images.

The case for Himax
Himax is a fabless chip designer of semiconductors for TVs, laptops, smartphones and tablets, and makes controllers for things like touch-sensor displays. It breaks its revenue down into three main segments: large-sized panel drivers, small and medium-sized panel drivers, and non-driver sales. 
The company made some gains in the fourth quarter of 2016, with large panel driver revenue grew growing 21.8%, small and medium-sized panel drivers ticking up 9%, and non-driver sales increasing 6%, year over year.
Many investors see two key sources of potentially significant growth for the company -- namely, augmented reality (AR) devices, and the possibility of earning a spot for its products in Apple's next iPhone. The AR opportunity is predicated on rising demand from Himax's customers for liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO) designs. Himax believes that growing demand in these two product areas could help the company in the long term, though those big gains probably aren't imminent.
"It is worth noting that despite the near-term headwinds, we remain positive on the long-term prospect of our WLO and LCOS product lines, judging by the expanding customer list that covers some of the world's biggest tech names," CEO Jordan Wu said on the Q4 earnings call.
Additionally, there's the chance that the company's 3D sensing technologies may be chosen for the next iPhone iteration. Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan believes that not only will the iPhone incorporate Himax's 3D sensor tech, but that its adoption in that device will spur other smartphone makers to follow suit. Chan believes this could end up contributing 20% of Himax's 2018 revenue.
The case for NVIDIA
NVIDIA is by far the leader in the graphics processing unit market, with more than 70%  of the discrete desktop GPU market share right now. That's great news for the company, as 62% of its revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2017 came from sales to GPUs for the gaming market.
The company had a tremendous Q4 (which ended in Jan. 29): Its gaming revenue increased by 66% year over year, data center revenue spiked 205%, automotive revenues jumped 37%, and professional visualization revenue ticked up 10%.
That growth is flowing from NVIDIA's accurate belief that it can take its class-leading GPUs and apply their power to other uses, and new markets. That mentality has, for example, allowed the company to expand into the driverless car segment with its Drive PX 2 supercomputer, and into artificial intelligence with its DGX-1 server.
Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs believes that NVIDIA could take $5 billion to $10 billion in the AI space with its GPUs, and the company has already proved it can hold its own in the semi-autonomous car market -- 80 automakers and suppliers are already using the company's Drive PX computer.





The verdict 
If you step back and a take a high-level view of these companies, there's not much of a comparison. Sure, Himax has some prospects within AR, and winning a spot in the next iPhone could certainly help the company. But Himax seems to playing the same tune that it always has -- trying to win a place in the next great device -- and that strategy has left investors disappointed in the past.  
The first bet was on Google Glass, which caused Himax's stock to pop -- and later, to crash. Then it was the prospect of making huge gains because of Microsoft's Hololens, which has since fizzled (at least, for now). Now, according to Morgan Stanley, it's the iPhone. The potential of gains from a victory with that already hugely popular device may seem less speculative than betting on the success of an AR device, but the story of small companies flying too close to Apple and then getting burned is all too familiar. 
Meanwhile, NVIDIA is consistently growing its core GPU gaming business, while successfully expanding its footprints in new markets. Sure, the company's 181% share price jump over the past 12 months might scare off some investors who think that the stock has little room left to rise. But adriverless cars and AI systems are only beginning to take off, and I think NVIDIA's solid prospects in those markets easily make it a better long-term play than Himax.
