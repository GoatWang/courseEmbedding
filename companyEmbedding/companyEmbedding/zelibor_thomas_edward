Thomas Edward Zelibor's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Portsmouth Department of Fire
Job Details
               The Portsmouth Department of Fire, Rescue, and Emergency Services provides an essential dimension to the public safety picture in our community. Although protecting the lives and property of our citizens from fire has always been the primary mission of the department, it is also intimately involved in local emergency preparedness.  It is important to remember that fire remains the second leading cause of accidental deaths in the home. More than 5,800 deaths are caused by fire each year, 1200 of which are children under the age of 19. Tragically, most fires that kill young children are started by young children. Our department has demonstrated leadership in instituting quality fire education programs for children throughout Portsmouth's public schools. We will continue to place emphasis on our first line of defense, fire prevention and education. Together, by supporting community based programs and initiatives, we have the ability to develop private/public partnerships that are in the best interest of everyone in the community. You are invited to browse our web site and learn more about our organization and the men and women who have dedicated themselves to the professional fire, rescue, and emergency medical services.
