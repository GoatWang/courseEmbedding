RISK/RETURN INFORMATION COMMON TO THE FUNDS



Each Fund is a mutual fund. A mutual fund pools shareholders' money and, using
professional investment managers, invests it in securities.


Each Fund has its own investment goal and strategies for reaching that goal.
Each Fund's assets are managed under the direction of its Adviser. The Adviser
invests each Fund's assets in a way it believes will help each Fund achieve its
goal. Still, investing in the Funds involves risk, and there is no guarantee
that the Funds will achieve their goal. In fact, no matter how good a job the
Adviser does, you could lose money on your investment in the Funds, just as you
could with other investments. A Fund share is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.



ALTHOUGH EACH FUND IS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00,
IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUNDS.






YEAR 2000 RISKS



Like other mutual funds (and most organizations around the world), the Funds
could be affected by computer problems related to the transition to the year
2000. While no one knows if these problems will have any impact on the Funds or
on the financial markets in general, each Fund is taking steps to protect Fund
investors. These include efforts to ensure that each Fund's own systems are
prepared to make the transition to the year 2000, and to determine that the
problem will not affect the systems used by each Fund's mission critical service
providers. The Funds have also sought and received assurances from these service
providers that they are devoting significant resources to prevent material
adverse consequences to the Funds. Whether these steps will be effective can
only be known for certain in the year 2000. While such assurances have been
received, year 2000 problems may ultimately negatively affect the companies and
governments whose securities the Funds purchase, which may have an impact on the
value of the Funds' shares. There is additional information on these risks in
the Statement of Additional Information.

FUND SUMMARY







INVESTMENT GOAL                    Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity while
                                   providing current income
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY             Very low
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY      The Fund is professionally managed to provide liquidity,
                                   diversification and a competitive yield by investing in U.S.
                                   Treasury securities













INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase
agreements fully-collateralized by U.S. Treasury obligations.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity that are marketable and liquid and offer
competitive yields. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated
level of interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to
the maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows strict Investment Company
Act rules about the credit quality, maturity and diversification of its
investments.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. Treasury securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

EXAMPLE



This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and that you sell your
shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that each year your
investment has a 5% return, that Fund expenses remain the same, and that you
reinvest all dividends and distributions. Although your actual costs and returns
might be different, your approximate costs of investing $10,000 in the Fund
would be:








                                                   1 YEAR    3 YEARS    5 YEARS    10 YEARS

FUND SUMMARY







INVESTMENT GOAL                    Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity while

                                   Government securities














INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations, obligations issued or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by agencies or instrumentalities of the
U.S. government, and repurchase agreements fully-collateralized by such
obligations.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity that are marketable and liquid and offer
competitive yields. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated
level of interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to
the maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows guidelines about the
credit quality, maturity and diversification of its investments. With respect to
maturity, these guidelines are more restrictive than the Investment Company Act
rules applicable to money market funds.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. government securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates. Obligations issued by some U.S. government agencies are
backed by the U.S. Treasury, while others are backed solely by the ability of
the agency to borrow from the U.S. Treasury or by the agency's own resources.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY             Very low
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY      The Fund is professionally managed to provide liquidity,
                                   diversification and a competitive yield by investing in high
                                   quality, short-term money market instruments














INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Prime Obligation Fund is comprised of short-term debt obligations of U.S.
issuers that are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations or that the Adviser determines are
of comparable quality. The Fund invests in: (i) commercial paper (including
asset-backed commercial paper) rated in the highest short-term rating category
by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization; (ii)
certificates of deposit, time deposits, bankers' acceptances, bank notes and
other obligations of U.S. commercial banks or savings and loan institutions that
meet certain asset requirements; (iii) short-term corporate obligations
(including asset-backed securities) rated in one of the two highest long-term
rating categories; (iv) short-term obligations issued by state and local
governments; and (v) U.S. Treasury obligations and obligations issued or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by agencies or instrumentalities of the
U.S. government. The Fund may also enter into fully-collateralized repurchase
agreements.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity, that are marketable and liquid, offer
competitive yields, and are issued by issuers that are on a sound financial
footing. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated level of
interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to the
maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows guidelines about the credit
quality, maturity and diversification of its investments. With respect to credit
quality and maturity, these guidelines are more restrictive than the Investment
Company Act rules applicable to money market funds.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. government securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates. Obligations issued by some U.S. government agencies are
backed by the U.S. Treasury, while others are backed solely by the ability of
the agency to borrow from the U.S. Treasury or by the agency's own resources.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

EXAMPLE



This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and that you sell your
shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that each year your
investment has a 5% return, that Fund expenses remain the same, and that you
reinvest all dividends and distributions. Although your actual costs and returns
might be different, your approximate costs of investing $10,000 in the Fund
would be:








                                                   1 YEAR    3 YEARS    5 YEARS    10 YEARS

10 PROSPECTUS




THE FUNDS' OTHER INVESTMENTS



This prospectus describes the Funds' primary investment strategies. Each Fund is
required to invest at least 80% of its assets, but normally will invest 100% of
its assets, in the types of securities described in this prospectus. However,
the Funds also may invest in other securities, use other strategies and engage
in other investment practices, which are described in detail in the Funds'
Statement of Additional Information (SAI).


The investments and strategies described in this prospectus are those that the
Funds use under normal conditions. During unusual economic or market conditions,
or for temporary defensive or liquidity purposes, the Funds may invest up to
100% of their assets in cash or cash equivalents that would not ordinarily be
consistent with the Funds' objectives. Of course, there is no guarantee that the
Funds will achieve their investment goal.






INVESTMENT ADVISER



The Investment Adviser makes investment decisions for the Funds and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers the Funds' investment program. The Board of
Trustees supervises the Adviser and establishes policies that the Adviser must
follow in its management activities.


Wellington Management Company, LLP ("Wellington"), serves as the Adviser to the
Funds. As of September 30, 1999, Wellington had approximately $217 billion in
assets under management. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, each Fund paid
Wellington advisory fees of 0.02% of average daily net assets.


John C. Keogh is the portfolio manager of the Funds. Mr. Keogh has been an
investment professional with Wellington since 1983.



PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES



This section tells you how to purchase or sell (sometimes called "redeem")
shares of the Funds. The Funds offer Class A Shares only to financial
institutions or intermediaries for their own or their customers' accounts. For
information on how to open an account and set up procedures for placing
transactions, please call 1-800-DIAL-SEI.



HOW TO PURCHASE FUND SHARES



You may purchase shares on any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for
business (a Business Day). However, Fund shares cannot be purchased by Federal
Reserve wire on Federal holidays on which wire transfers are restricted.


Financial institutions and intermediaries may purchase Class A Shares by placing
orders with the Funds' Transfer Agent (or its authorized agent). Institutions
and intermediaries that use certain SEI proprietary systems may place orders
electronically through those systems. Cash investments must be transmitted or
delivered in federal funds to the Funds' wire agent by the close of business on
the same day the order is placed. The Funds may reject any purchase order if
they determine that accepting the order would not be in the best interests of
the Funds or their shareholders.


When you purchase or sell Fund shares through certain financial institutions
(rather than directly from the Fund), you may have to transmit your purchase and
sale requests to certain financial institutions at an earlier time for your
transaction to become effective that day. This allows these financial
institutions time to process your requests and transmit them to the Funds.






PROSPECTUS 11




PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES



Certain other intermediaries, including certain broker-dealers and shareholder
organizations, are authorized to accept purchase, redemption and exchange
requests for Fund shares. These requests are normally executed at the net asset
value per share (NAV) next determined after the intermediary receives the
request. These authorized intermediaries are responsible for transmitting
requests and delivering funds on a timely basis.


Investors who deal directly with a financial institution or financial
intermediary will have to follow the institution's or intermediary's procedures
for transacting with the Funds. For more information about how to purchase or
sell Fund shares through your financial institution, you should contact your
financial institution directly. Investors may be charged a fee for purchase
and/or redemption transactions effectuated through certain of these
broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.


Each Fund's NAV is calculated once each Business Day at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time
(3:00 p.m., Eastern time for the Prime Obligation Fund). So, for you to be
eligible to receive dividends declared on the day you submit your purchase
order, generally the Funds (or their authorized intermediaries) must receive
your purchase order and federal funds (readily available funds) before the Funds
calculate their NAV.



HOW THE FUNDS CALCULATE NAV



NAV for one Fund share is the value of that share's portion of all of the net
assets in the Fund.


The Funds value their securities by utilizing the amortized cost valuation
method (as described in the SAI). If the Funds think amortized cost is
unreliable, fair value prices may be determined in good faith using methods
approved by the Board of Trustees. The Funds expect their NAV to remain constant
at $1.00 per share, although there is no guarantee that any Fund can accomplish
this.



HOW TO SELL YOUR FUND SHARES



Holders of Class A Shares may sell shares on any Business Day by following the
procedures established when they opened their account or accounts with their
financial institution or intermediary. You may also sell your shares by
contacting your financial institution or financial intermediary by telephone.
Your financial institution or intermediary may charge you a fee for its
services. The sale price of each share will be the next NAV determined after the
Funds (or their authorized intermediaries) receive your request.



RECEIVING YOUR MONEY



Normally, the Funds will make payment on your sale as promptly as possible after
they receive your request, but it may take up to three Business Days. Your
proceeds will be wired to your bank account.



REDEMPTIONS IN KIND



The Funds generally pay sale (redemption) proceeds in cash. However, under
unusual conditions that make the payment of cash unwise (and for the protection
of the Funds' remaining shareholders) the Funds might pay all or part of your
redemption proceeds in liquid securities with a market value equal to the
redemption price (redemption in kind). It is highly unlikely that your shares
would ever be redeemed in kind, but if they were, you might have to pay
transaction costs to sell the securities distributed to you, as well as taxes on
any capital gains from the sale as with any redemption.



SUSPENSION OF YOUR RIGHT TO SELL YOUR SHARES



The Funds may suspend your right to sell your shares if the NYSE restricts
trading, the SEC declares an emergency or for other reasons. More information
about this is in the SAI.

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES




DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES



SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCo.) is the distributor of the shares of
the Funds. SIDCo. receives no compensation for distributing the Funds' Class A
Shares.


For Class A Shares, shareholder servicing fees, as a percentage of average daily
net assets, may be up to 0.25%. The Distributor has voluntarily agreed to waive
the shareholder servicing fees applicable to Class A Shares of the Funds. The
Distributor has no current intention to discontinue this voluntary waiver.






DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



Each Fund declares dividends daily and distributes its income monthly. The Funds
make distributions of capital gains, if any, at least annually.


You will receive dividends and distributions in cash unless otherwise stated.



TAXES



PLEASE CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. Below the Funds have summarized some important tax
issues that affect the Funds and their shareholders. This summary is based on
current tax laws, which may change.


The Funds will distribute substantially all of its income and capital gains, if
any. The dividends and distributions you receive may be subject to federal,
state and local taxation, depending upon your tax situation. If so, they are
taxable whether or not you reinvest them. Income distributions are generally
taxable at ordinary tax rates. Capital gains distributions are generally taxable
at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains. EACH SALE OF FUND SHARES IS
A TAXABLE EVENT.



MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TAXES IS IN THE FUNDS' SAI.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS



The tables that follow present performance information about Class A Shares of
the Funds. This information is intended to help you understand the Funds'
financial performance for the past five years. Some of this information reflects
financial information for a single Fund share. The total returns in the table
represent the rate that you would have earned (or lost) on an investment in a
Fund, assuming you reinvested all of your dividends and distributions.


This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
public accountants. Their report, along with the Funds' financial statements,
appears in the annual report that accompanies the Funds' SAI. You can obtain the

                                                    RISK/RETURN INFORMATION








The Fund is a mutual fund. A mutual fund pools shareholders' money and, using
professional investment managers, invests it in securities.


The Fund has its own investment goal and strategies for reaching that goal. The
Fund's assets are managed under the direction of its Adviser. The Adviser
invests the Fund's assets in a way it believes will help the Fund achieve its
goal. Still, investing in the Fund involves risk, and there is no guarantee that
the Fund will achieve its goal. In fact, no matter how good a job the Adviser
does, you could lose money on your investment in the Fund, just as you could
with other investments. A Fund share is not a bank deposit and it is not insured
or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.



ALTHOUGH THE FUND IS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, IT
IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUND.






YEAR 2000 RISKS



Like other mutual funds (and most organizations around the world), the Fund
could be affected by computer problems related to the transition to the year
2000. While no one knows if these problems will have any impact on the Fund or
on the financial markets in general, the Fund is taking steps to protect Fund
investors. These include efforts to ensure that the Fund's own systems are
prepared to make the transition to the year 2000, and to determine that the
problem will not affect the systems used by the Fund's mission critical service
providers. The Fund has also sought and received assurances from these service
providers that they are devoting significant resources to prevent material
adverse consequences to the Fund. Whether these steps will be effective can only
be known for certain in the year 2000. While such assurances have been received,
year 2000 problems may ultimately negatively affect the companies and
governments whose securities the Fund purchases, which may have an impact on the
value of the Fund's shares. There is additional information on these risks in
the Statement of Additional Information.

FUND SUMMARY







INVESTMENT GOAL                    Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity while
                                   providing current income
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY             Very low
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY      The Fund is professionally managed to provide liquidity,
                                   diversification and a competitive yield by investing in U.S.
                                   Treasury securities














INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase
agreements fully-collateralized by U.S. Treasury obligations.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity that are marketable and liquid and offer
competitive yields. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated
level of interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to
the maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows strict Investment Company
Act rules about the credit quality, maturity and diversification of its
investments.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. Treasury securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

FUND FEES AND EXPENSES






THIS TABLE DESCRIBES THE HIGHEST FEES AND EXPENSES THAT YOU MAY CURRENTLY PAY IF
YOU BUY AND HOLD SHARES OF THE FUND.







ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES
(EXPENSES DEDUCTED FROM FUND ASSETS)       CLASS D SHARES
Investment Advisory Fees                       0.03%
Distribution (12b-1) Fees                      0.25%
Other Expenses                                 0.60%

TOTAL ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES           0.88%
Fee Waivers and Expense Reimbursements         0.04%
                                               -----
NET EXPENSES                                   0.84%*








* SEI INVESTMENTS FUND MANAGEMENT HAS CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO WAIVE FEES AND TO
REIMBURSE EXPENSES IN ORDER TO KEEP TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES FROM EXCEEDING
0.84%.


The Fund's total actual annual fund operating expenses for the most recent
fiscal year were less than the amount shown above because the Adviser,
Administrator and/or Distributor are each voluntarily waiving a portion of their
fees in order to keep total operating expenses at a specified level. The
Adviser, Administrator and or Distributor may each discontinue all or part of
their waiver at any time. With this fee waiver, the Fund's actual total
operating expenses are as follows:








TREASURY SECURITIES FUND -- CLASS D SHARES                    0.79%








For more information about these fees, see "Investment Adviser" and
"Distribution of Fund Shares."



EXAMPLE



This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and that you sell your
shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that each year your
investment has a 5% return, that Fund expenses remain the same, and that you
reinvest dividends and distributions. Although your actual costs and returns
might be different, your approximate costs of investing $10,000 in the Fund
would be:








                                                   1 YEAR    3 YEARS    5 YEARS    10 YEARS

6 PROSPECTUS




THE FUND'S OTHER INVESTMENTS



This prospectus describes the Fund's primary investment strategies. The Fund is
required to invest at least 80% of its assets, but normally will invest 100% of
its assets, in the types of securities described in this prospectus. However,
the Fund also may invest in other securities, use other strategies and engage in
other investment practices, which are described in detail in the Fund's
Statement of Additional Information (SAI).


The investments and strategies described in this prospectus are those that the
Fund uses under normal conditions. During unusual economic or market conditions,
or for temporary defensive or liquidity purposes, the Fund may invest up to 100%
of its assets in cash or cash equivalents that would not ordinarily be
consistent with the Fund's objectives. Of course, there is no guarantee that the
Fund will achieve its investment goal.






INVESTMENT ADVISER



The Investment Adviser makes investment decisions for the Fund and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers the Fund's investment program. The Board of
Trustees supervises the Adviser and establishes policies that the Adviser must
follow in its management activities.


Wellington Management Company, LLP ("Wellington"), serves as the Adviser to the
Fund. As of September 30, 1999, Wellington had approximately $217 billion in
assets under management. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, the Fund paid
Wellington advisory fees of 0.02% of its average daily net assets.


John C. Keogh is the portfolio manager of the Fund. Mr. Keogh has been an
investment professional with Wellington since 1983.



PURCHASING, SELLING AND EXCHANGING FUND SHARES



This section tells you how to purchase or sell (sometimes called "redeem") Class
D Shares of the Fund. The Fund offers Class D Shares to individuals and
financial institutions for their own or their customers' accounts. For
information on how to open an account and set up procedures for placing
transactions, please call 1-800-DIAL-SEI.



HOW TO PURCHASE FUND SHARES



You may purchase shares on any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for
business (a Business Day). However, Fund shares cannot be purchased by Federal
Reserve wire on Federal holidays on which wire transfers are restricted. The
Fund may reject any purchase order if it determines that accepting the order
would not be in the best interests of the Fund or its shareholders.


When you purchase or sell Fund shares through certain financial institutions
(rather than directly from the Fund), you may have to transmit your purchase and
sale requests to these financial institutions at an earlier time for your
transaction to become effective that day. This allows these financial
institutions time to process your requests and transmit them to the Fund.


Certain other intermediaries, including certain broker-dealers and shareholder
organizations, are authorized to accept purchase, redemption and exchange
requests for Fund shares. These requests are normally executed at the net asset
value per share (NAV) next determined after the intermediary receives the
request. These authorized intermediaries are responsible for transmitting
requests and delivering funds on a timely basis.


Investors who deal directly with a financial institution or financial
intermediary will have to follow the institution's or intermediary's procedures
for transacting with the Fund. For more information about how to purchase or
sell Fund shares through your financial institution, you should contact your
financial institution directly. Investors may be charged a fee for purchase
and/or redemption transactions effectuated through certain of these
broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.






PROSPECTUS 7




PURCHASING, SELLING AND EXCHANGING FUND SHARES



The Fund's NAV is calculated once each Business Day at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time.
So, for you to be eligible to receive dividends declared on the day you submit
your purchase order, generally the Fund (or its authorized intermediary) must
receive your purchase order and federal funds (readily available funds) before
the Fund calculates its NAV.



HOW THE FUND CALCULATES NAV



NAV for one Fund share is the value of that share's portion of all of the net
assets in the Fund.


The Fund values its securities by utilizing the amortized cost valuation method
(as described in the SAI). If the Fund thinks amortized cost is unreliable, fair
value prices may be determined in good faith using methods approved by the Board
of Trustees. The Fund expects its NAV to remain constant at $1.00 per share,
although there is no guarantee that the Fund can accomplish this.



AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT PLAN



If you have a checking or savings account with a bank, you may purchase Class D
shares automatically through regular deductions from your account in amounts of
at least $25.



HOW TO SELL YOUR FUND SHARES



Holders of Class D Shares may sell shares on any Business Day by following the
procedures established when they opened their account or accounts with their
financial institution or intermediary. You may sell your shares by contacting
your financial institution or financial intermediary by mail or telephone. Your
financial institution or intermediary may charge you a fee for its services. The
Fund offers free check writing services to Class D shareholders. You may redeem
shares by writing checks on your account for $500 or more after establishing a
check-writing account through your financial institution/intermediary. The sale
price of each share will be the next NAV determined after the Fund (or its
authorized institution) receives your request.



SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN



If you have at least $10,000 in your account, you may use the systematic
withdrawal plan. Under the plan you may arrange monthly, quarterly, semi-annual
or annual automatic withdrawals of at least $50 from any Fund. The proceeds of
each withdrawal will be mailed to you by check or, if you have a checking or
savings account with a bank, electronically transferred to your account.



RECEIVING YOUR MONEY



Normally, the Fund will make payment on your sale as promptly as possible after
it receives your request, but it may take up to three Business Days. Your
proceeds will be wired to your bank account.



REDEMPTIONS IN KIND



The Fund generally pays sale (redemption) proceeds in cash. However, under
unusual conditions that make the payment of cash unwise (and for the protection
of the Fund's remaining shareholders) the Fund might pay all or part of your
redemption proceeds in liquid securities with a market value equal to the
redemption price (redemption in kind). It is highly unlikely that






8 PROSPECTUS




PURCHASING, SELLING AND EXCHANGING FUND SHARES



your shares would ever be redeemed in kind, but if they were, you might have to
pay transaction costs to sell the securities distributed to you, as well as
taxes on any capital gains from the sale as with any redemption.



SUSPENSION OF YOUR RIGHT TO SELL YOUR SHARES



The Fund may suspend your right to sell your shares if the NYSE restricts
trading, the SEC declares an emergency or for other reasons. More information
about this is in the SAI.



TELEPHONE TRANSACTIONS



Purchasing, selling and exchanging Fund shares over the telephone is extremely
convenient, but not without risk. Although the Fund has certain safeguards and
procedures to confirm the identity of callers and the authenticity of
instructions, the Fund is not responsible for any losses or costs incurred by
following telephone instructions the Fund reasonably believes to be genuine. If
you or your financial institution transact with the Fund over the telephone, you
will generally bear the risk of any loss.



DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES



SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCo.) is the distributor of the Class D
Shares of the Fund.


The Fund has adopted a distribution plan that allows the Fund to pay SIDCo.
distribution fees for the sale and distribution of its Class D Shares. Because
these fees are paid out of the Fund's assets continuously, over time these fees
will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than paying
other types of sales charges. For Class D Shares, the distribution fee is 0.25%
of the average daily net assets of the Fund.


The Distributor may, from time to time in its sole discretion, institute one or
more promotional incentive programs for dealers, which will be paid for by the
Distributor from any sales chare it receives or from any other source available
to it. Under any such program, the Distributor may provide incentives, in the
form of cash or other compensation, including merchandise, airline vouchers,
trips and vacation packages, to dealers selling Class D Shares of the Fund.



HOW TO EXCHANGE YOUR SHARES



You may exchange your Class D Shares of the Fund for Class D Shares of any other
SEI Fund on any Business Day by contacting your financial institution or
intermediary by mail or telephone. Your financial institution or intermediary
may charge you a fee for its services. This exchange privilege may be changed or
canceled at any time upon 60 days' notice.


When you exchange shares, you are really selling your shares and buying other
Fund shares. So, your sale price and purchase price will be based on the NAV
next calculated after the Fund receives your exchange request. If you exchange
into a Fund that is subject to a sales charge, you may have to pay the sales
charge charged by that Fund.






DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



The Fund declares dividends daily and distributes its income monthly. The Fund
makes distributions of capital gains, if any, at least annually.


You will receive dividends and distributions in cash unless otherwise stated.



TAXES



PLEASE CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. Below the Fund has summarized some important tax
issues that affect the Fund and its shareholders. This summary is based on
current tax laws, which may change.


The Fund will distribute substantially all of its income and capital gains, if
any. The dividends and distributions you receive may be subject to federal,
state and local taxation, depending upon your tax situation. If so, they are
taxable whether or not you reinvest them. Income distributions are generally
taxable at ordinary income tax rates. Capital gains distributions are generally
taxable at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains. EACH SALE OR
EXCHANGE OF FUND SHARES IS A TAXABLE EVENT.



MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TAXES IS IN THE FUND'S SAI.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS



The table that follows presents performance information about Class D Shares of
the Fund. This information is intended to help you understand the Fund's
financial performance for the past five years, or, if shorter, the period of the
Fund's operations. Some of this information reflects financial information for a
single Fund share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that you
would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the Fund, assuming you
reinvested all of your dividends and distributions.


This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
public accountants. Their report, along with the Fund's financial statements,
appears in the annual report that accompanies the Fund's SAI. You can obtain the
annual report, which contains more performance information, at no charge by

RISK/RETURN INFORMATION



The Fund is a mutual fund. A mutual fund pools shareholders' money and, using
professional investment managers, invests it in securities.


The Fund has its own investment goal and strategies for reaching that goal. The
Fund's assets are managed under the direction of its Adviser. The Adviser
invests the Fund's assets in a way that it believes will help the Fund achieve
its goal. Still, investing in the Fund involves risk, and there is no guarantee
that the Fund will achieve its goal. In fact, no matter how good a job the
Adviser does, you could lose money on your investment in the Fund, just as you
could with other investments. A Fund share is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.



ALTHOUGH THE FUND IS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00,

IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUND.




YEAR 2000 RISKS



Like other mutual funds (and most organizations around the world), the Fund
could be affected by computer problems related to the transition to the year
2000. While no one knows if these problems will have any impact on the Fund or
on the financial markets in general, the Fund is taking steps to protect Fund
investors. These include efforts to ensure that the Fund's own systems are
prepared to make the transition to the year 2000, and to determine that the
problem will not affect the systems used by the Fund's mission critical service
providers. The Fund has also sought and received assurances from these service
providers that they are devoting significant resources to prevent material
adverse consequences to the Fund. Whether these steps will be effective can only
be known for certain in the year 2000. While such assurances have been received,
year 2000 problems may ultimately negatively affect the companies and
governments whose securities the Fund purchases, which may have an impact on the
value of the Fund's shares. There is additional information on these risks in
the Statement of Additional Information.

INSTITUTIONAL CASH FUND







FUND SUMMARY

INVESTMENT GOAL                               Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity
                                              while providing current income

SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY                        Very low

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY                 The Fund is professionally managed to provide
                                              liquidity, diversification and a competitive yield
                                              by investing in U.S. Treasury securities












INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity that are marketable and liquid and offer
competitive yields. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated
level of interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to
the maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows strict Investment Company
Act rules about the credit quality, maturity and diversification of its
investments.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. Treasury securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

FUND FEES AND EXPENSES






THIS TABLE DESCRIBES THE HIGHEST FEES AND EXPENSES THAT YOU MAY CURRENTLY PAY IF
YOU BUY AND HOLD SHARES OF THE FUND.

(EXPENSES DEDUCTED FROM FUND ASSETS)                                             CLASS A SHARES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investment Advisory Fees                                                             0.03%
Distribution (12b-1) Fees                                                             None
Other Expenses                                                                       0.70%
                                                                                     -----

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








*     The Fund's total actual annual fund operating expenses for the most recent
fiscal year were less than the amount shown above because the Adviser,
Administrator, and/or Distributor are each voluntarily waiving a portion of
their fees in order to keep total operating expenses at a specified level. The
Adviser, Administrator, and or Distributor may each discontinue all or part of
their waiver at any time. With this fee waiver, the Fund's actual total
operating expenses are as follows:



Institutional Cash Fund -- Class A Shares                     0.44%



For more information about these fees, see "Investment Adviser."



EXAMPLE



This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and that you sell your
shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that each year your
investment has a 5% return, that Fund expenses remain the same, and that you
reinvest all dividends and distributions. Although your actual costs and returns
might be different, your approximate costs of investing $10,000 in the Fund
would be:








                                                    1 YEAR         3 YEARS         5 YEARS        10 YEARS

THE FUND'S OTHER INVESTMENTS



This prospectus describes the Fund's primary investment strategies. The Fund is
required to invest at least 80% of its assets, but normally will invest 100% of
its assets, in the types of securities described in this prospectus. However,
the Fund also may invest in other securities, use other strategies and engage in
other investment practices, which are described in detail in the Fund's
Statement of Additional Information (SAI).


The investments and strategies described in this prospectus are those that the
Fund uses under normal conditions. During unusual economic or market conditions,
or for temporary defensive or liquidity purposes, the Fund may invest up to 100%
of its assets in cash or cash equivalents that would not ordinarily be
consistent with the Fund's objective. Of course, there is no guarantee that the
Fund will achieve its investment goal.






INVESTMENT ADVISER



The Investment Adviser makes investment decisions for the Fund and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers the Fund's investment program. The Board of
Trustees supervises the Adviser and establishes policies that the Adviser must
follow in its management activities.


Wellington Management Company, LLP ("Wellington"), serves as the Adviser to the
Fund. As of September 30, 1999, Wellington had approximately $217 billion in
assets under management. As of September 30, 1999, the Fund was no longer in
operation, and therefore did not pay an advisory fee to Wellington.


John C. Keogh is the portfolio manager of the Fund. Mr. Keogh has been an
investment professional with Wellington since 1983.



PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES



This section tells you how to purchase or sell (sometimes called "redeem")
shares of the Fund. The Fund offers Class A Shares only to financial
institutions or intermediaries for their own or their customers' accounts. For
information on how to open an account and set up procedures for placing
transactions, please call 1-800-DIAL-SEI.



HOW TO PURCHASE FUND SHARES



You may purchase shares on any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for
business (a Business Day). However, Fund shares cannot be purchased by Federal
Reserve wire on Federal holidays on which wire transfers are restricted.


Financial institutions and intermediaries may purchase Class A Shares by placing
orders with the Fund's Transfer Agent (or its authorized agent). Institutions
and intermediaries that use certain SEI proprietary systems may place orders
electronically through those systems. Cash investments must be transmitted or
delivered in federal funds to the Fund's wire agent by the close of business on
the same day the order is placed. The Fund may reject any purchase order if they
determine that accepting the order would not be in the best interests of the
Fund or its shareholders.


Page 7 of 13





When you purchase or sell Fund shares through certain financial institutions
(rather than directly from the Fund), you may have to transmit your purchase and
sale requests to these financial institutions at an earlier time for your
transaction to become effective that day. This allows these financial
institutions time to process your requests and transmit them to the Fund.


Certain other intermediaries, including certain broker-dealers and shareholder
organizations, are authorized to accept purchase, redemption and exchange
requests for Fund shares. These requests are normally executed at the net asset
value per share (NAV) next determined after the intermediary receives the
request. These authorized intermediaries are responsible for transmitting
requests and delivering funds on a timely basis.


Investors who deal directly with a financial institution or financial
intermediary will have to follow the institution's or intermediary's procedures
for transacting with the Fund. For more information about how to purchase or
sell Fund shares through your financial institution, you should contact your
financial institution directly. Investors may be charged a fee for purchase
and/or redemption transactions effectuated through certain of these
broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.


The Fund's NAV is calculated once each Business Day at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time.
So, for you to be eligible to receive dividends declared on the day you submit
your purchase order, generally the Fund (or its authorized intermediary) must
receive your purchase order and federal funds (readily available funds) before
the Fund calculates its NAV.



HOW THE FUND CALCULATES NAV



NAV for one Fund share is the value of that share's portion of all of the net
assets in the Fund.


The Fund values its securities by utilizing the amortized cost valuation method
(as described in the SAI). If the Fund thinks amortized cost is unreliable, fair
value prices may be determined in good faith using methods approved by the Board
of Trustees. The Fund expects its NAV to remain constant at $1.00 per share,
although there is no guarantee that the Fund can accomplish this.



HOW TO SELL YOUR FUND SHARES



Holders of Class A Shares may sell shares on any Business Day by following the
procedures established when they opened their account or accounts with their
financial institution or intermediary. You may also sell your shares by
contacting your financial institution or financial intermediary by telephone.
Your financial institution or intermediary may charge you a fee for its
services. The sale price of each share will be the next NAV determined after the
Fund (or its authorized intermediaries) receives your request.



RECEIVING YOUR MONEY



Normally, the Fund will make payment on your sale as promptly as possible after
it receives your request, but it may take up to three Business Days. Your
proceeds will be wired to your bank account.


Page 8 of 13






REDEMPTIONS IN KIND



The Fund generally pays sale (redemption) proceeds in cash. However, under
unusual conditions that make the payment of cash unwise (and for the protection
of the Fund's remaining shareholders) the Fund might pay all or part of your
redemption proceeds in liquid securities with a market value equal to the
redemption price (redemption in kind). It is highly unlikely that your shares
would ever be redeemed in kind, but if they were, you might have to pay
transaction costs to sell the securities distributed to you, as well as taxes on
any capital gains from the sale as with any redemption.



SUSPENSION OF YOUR RIGHT TO SELL YOUR SHARES



The Fund may suspend your right to sell your shares if the NYSE restricts
trading, the SEC declares an emergency or for other reasons. More information
about this is in the SAI.



DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES



SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCo.) is the distributor of the shares of
the Fund. SIDCo. receives no compensation for distributing the Fund's Class A
Shares.


For Class A Shares, shareholder servicing fees, as a percentage of average daily
net assets, may be up to 0.25%. The Distributor has voluntarily agreed to waive
the shareholder servicing fees applicable to Class A Shares of the Fund. The
Distributor has no current intention to discontinue this voluntary waiver.






DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



The Fund declares dividends daily and distributes its income monthly. The Fund
makes distributions of capital gains, if any, at least annually.


You will receive dividends and distributions in the form cash unless otherwise
stated.



TAXES



PLEASE CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. Below the Fund has summarized some important tax
issues that affect the Fund and its shareholders. This summary is based on
current tax laws, which may change.


The Fund will distribute substantially all of its income and capital gains, if
any. The dividends and distributions you receive may be subject to federal,
state and local taxation, depending upon your tax situation. If so, they are
taxable whether or not you reinvest them. Income distribution are generally
taxable at ordinary interest rates. Capital gains distributions are generally
taxable at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains. EACH SALE OF FUND
SHARES IS A TAXABLE EVENT.



MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TAXES IS IN THE FUND'S SAI.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS



The table that follows presents performance information about Class A Shares of
the Fund. This information is intended to help you understand the Fund's
financial performance for the last five years of the Fund's operations. Some of
this information reflects financial information for a single Fund share. The
total returns in the table represent the rate that you would have earned (or
lost) on an investment in a Fund, assuming you reinvested all of your dividends
and distributions.

RISK/RETURN INFORMATION COMMON TO THE FUNDS



Each Fund is a mutual fund. A mutual fund pools shareholders' money and, using
professional investment managers, invests it in securities.


Each Fund has its own investment goal and strategies for reaching that goal.
Each Fund's assets are managed under the direction of its Adviser. The Adviser
invests each Fund's assets in a way it believes will help each Fund achieve its
goal. Still, investing in the Funds involve risk, and there is no guarantee that
the Funds will achieve their goal. In fact, no matter how good a job the Adviser
does, you could lose money on your investment in the Funds, just as you could
with other investments. A Fund share is not a bank deposit and it is not insured
or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.



ALTHOUGH EACH FUND IS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00,
IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUNDS.






YEAR 2000 RISKS



Like other mutual funds (and most organizations around the world), the Funds
could be affected by computer problems related to the transition to the year
2000. While no one knows if these problems will have any impact on the Funds or
on the financial markets in general, each Fund is taking steps to protect Fund
investors. These include efforts to ensure that each Fund's own systems are
prepared to make the transition to the year 2000, and to determine that the
problem will not affect the systems used by each Fund's mission critical service
providers. The Funds have also sought and received assurances from these service
providers that they are devoting significant resources to prevent material
adverse consequences to the Funds. Whether these steps will be effective can
only be known for certain in the year 2000. While such assurances have been
received, year 2000 problems may ultimately negatively affect the companies and
governments whose securities the Funds purchase, which may have an impact on the
value of the Funds' shares. There is additional information on these risks in
the Statement of Additional Information.

FUND SUMMARY







INVESTMENT GOAL                    Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity while
                                   providing current income
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY             Very low
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY      The Fund is professionally managed to provide liquidity,
                                   diversification and a competitive yield by investing in U.S.
                                   Treasury securities














INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase
agreements fully-collateralized by U.S. Treasury obligations.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity that are marketable and liquid and offer
competitive yields. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated
level of interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to
the maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows strict Investment Company
Act rules about the credit quality, maturity and diversification of its
investments.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. Treasury securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

EXAMPLE



This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and that you sell your
shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that each year your
investment has a 5% return, that Fund expenses remain the same, and that you
reinvest all dividends and distributions. Although your actual costs and returns
might be different, your approximate costs of investing $10,000 in the Fund
would be:

FUND SUMMARY







INVESTMENT GOAL                    Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity while
                                   providing current income
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY             Very low
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY      The Fund is professionally managed to provide liquidity,
                                   diversification and a competitive yield by investing in high
                                   quality, short-term money market instruments














INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Prime Obligation Fund is comprised of short-term debt obligations of U.S.
issuers that are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations or that the Adviser determines are
of comparable quality. The Fund invests in: (i) commercial paper (including
asset-backed commercial paper) rated in the highest short-term rating category
by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization; (ii)
certificates of deposit, time deposits, bankers' acceptances, bank notes and
other obligations of U.S. commercial banks or savings and loan institutions that
meet certain asset requirements; (iii) short-term corporate obligations
(including asset-backed securities) rated in one of the two highest long-term
rating categories; (iv) short-term obligations issued by state and local
governments; and (v) U.S. Treasury obligations and obligations issued or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by agencies or instrumentalities of the
U.S. government. The Fund may also enter into fully-collateralized repurchase
agreements.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity, that are marketable and liquid, offer
competitive yields, and are issued by issuers that are on a sound financial
footing. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated level of
interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to the
maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows guidelines about the credit
quality, maturity and diversification of its investments. With respect to credit
quality and maturity, these guidelines are more restrictive than the Investment
Company Act rules applicable to money market funds.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. government securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates. Obligations issued by some U.S. government agencies are
backed by the U.S. Treasury, while others are backed solely by the ability of
the agency to borrow from the U.S. Treasury or by the agency's own resources.


AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.

THE FUND'S OTHER INVESTMENTS



This prospectus describes the Funds' primary investment strategies. Each Fund is
required to invest at least 80% of its assets, but normally will invest 100% of
its assets, in the types of securities described in this prospectus. However,
the Funds also may invest in other securities, use other strategies and engage
in other investment practices, which are described in detail in the Funds'
Statement of Additional Information (SAI).


The investments and strategies described in this prospectus are those that the
Funds use under normal conditions. During unusual economic or market conditions,
or for temporary defensive or liquidity purposes, the Funds may invest up to
100% of their assets in cash or cash equivalents that would not ordinarily be
consistent with the Funds' objectives. Of course, there is no guarantee that the
Funds will achieve their investment goal.






INVESTMENT ADVISER



The Investment Adviser makes investment decisions for the Funds and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers the Funds' investment program. The Board of
Trustees supervises the Adviser and establishes policies that the Adviser must
follow in its management activities.


Wellington Management Company, LLP ("Wellington"), serves as the Adviser to the
Funds. As of September 30, 1999, Wellington had approximately $217 billion in
assets under management. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, each Fund paid
Wellington advisory fees of 0.024% of average daily net assets.


John C. Keogh is the portfolio manager of the Funds. Mr. Keogh has been an
investment professional with Wellington since 1983.



PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES



This section tells you how to purchase or sell (sometimes called "redeem")
shares of the Funds. The Funds offer Class A Shares only to financial
institutions or intermediaries for their own or their customers' accounts. For
information on how to open an account and set up procedures for placing
transactions, please call 1-800-DIAL-SEI.



HOW TO PURCHASE FUND SHARES



You may purchase shares on any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for
business (a Business Day). However, Fund shares cannot be purchased by Federal
Reserve wire on Federal holidays on which wire transfers are restricted.


Financial institutions and intermediaries may purchase Class A Shares by placing
orders with the Funds' Transfer Agent (or its authorized agent). Institutions
and intermediaries that use certain SEI proprietary systems may place orders
electronically through those systems. Cash investments must be transmitted or
delivered in federal funds to the Funds' wire agent by the close of business on
the same day the order is placed. The Funds may reject any purchase order if
they determine that accepting the order would not be in the best interests of
the Funds or their shareholders.


When you purchase or sell Fund shares through certain financial institutions
(rather than directly from the Funds), you may have to transmit your purchase
and sale requests to certain financial institutions at an earlier time for your
transaction to become effective that day. This allows these financial
institutions time to process your requests and transmit them to the Funds.






PROSPECTUS 9




PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES



Certain other intermediaries, including certain broker-dealers and shareholder
organizations, are authorized to accept purchase, redemption and exchange
requests for Fund shares. These requests are normally executed at the net asset
value per share (NAV) next determined after the intermediary receives the
request. These authorized intermediaries are responsible for transmitting
requests and delivering funds on a timely basis.


Investors who deal directly with a financial institution or financial
intermediary will have to follow the institution's or intermediary's procedures
for transacting with the Funds. For more information about how to purchase or
sell Fund shares through your financial institution, you should contact your
financial institution directly. Investors may be charged a fee for purchase
and/or redemption transactions effectuated through certain of these
broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.


The Treasury Securities Fund's NAV is calculated once each Business Day at 2:00

p.m., Eastern time. The Prime Obligation Fund's NAV is calculated once each
Business Day at 3:00 p.m., Eastern time. So, for you to be eligible to receive
dividends declared on the day you submit your purchase order, generally the
Funds (or their authorized intermediaries) must receive your purchase order and
federal funds (readily available funds) before the Funds calculate their NAV.



HOW THE FUNDS CALCULATE NAV



NAV for one Fund share is the value of that share's portion of all of the net
assets in the Fund.


The Funds value their securities by utilizing the amortized cost valuation
method (as described in the SAI). If the Funds think amortized cost is
unreliable, fair value prices may be determined in good faith using methods
approved by the Board of Trustees. The Funds expect their NAV to remain constant
at $1.00 per share, although there is no guarantee that any Fund can accomplish
this.



HOW TO SELL YOUR FUND SHARES



Holders of Class A Shares may sell shares on any Business Day by following the
procedures established when they opened their account or accounts with their
financial institution or intermediary. You may also sell your shares by
contacting your financial institution or financial intermediary by telephone.
Your financial institution or intermediary may charge you a fee for its
services. The sale price of each share will be the next NAV determined after the
Funds (or their authorized intermediaries) receive your request.



RECEIVING YOUR MONEY



Normally, the Funds will make payment on your sale as promptly as possible after
they receive your request, but it may take up to three Business Days. Your
proceeds will be wired to your bank account.



REDEMPTIONS IN KIND



The Funds generally pay sale (redemption) proceeds in cash. However, under
unusual conditions that make the payment of cash unwise (and for the protection
of the Funds' remaining shareholders) the Funds might pay all or part of your
redemption proceeds in liquid securities with a market value equal to the
redemption price (redemption in kind). It is highly unlikely that your shares
would ever be redeemed in kind, but if they were, you might have to pay
transaction costs to sell the securities distributed to you, as well as taxes on
any capital gains from the sale as with any redemption.

PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES

about this is in the SAI.






PROSPECTUS 11







DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES




DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES



SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCo.) is the distributor of the shares of
the Funds. SIDCo. receives no compensation for distributing the Funds' Class A
Shares.


For Class A Shares, shareholder servicing fees, as a percentage of average daily
net assets, may be up to 0.25%. The Distributor has voluntarily agreed to waive
the shareholder servicing fees applicable to Class A Shares of the Funds. The
Distributor has no current intention to discontinue this voluntary waiver.






DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



Each Fund declares dividends daily and distributes its income monthly. The Funds
make distributions of capital gains, if any, at least annually.


You will receive dividends and distributions in cash unless otherwise stated.



TAXES



PLEASE CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. Below the Funds have summarized some important tax
issues that affect the Funds and their shareholders. This summary is based on
current tax laws, which may change.


The Funds will distribute substantially all of its income and capital gains, if
any. The dividends and distributions you receive may be subject to federal,
state and local taxation, depending upon your tax situation. If so, they are
taxable whether or not you reinvest them. Income distributions are generally
taxable at ordinary tax rates. Capital gains distributions are generally taxable
at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains. EACH SALE OF FUND SHARES IS
A TAXABLE EVENT.



MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TAXES IS IN THE FUNDS' SAI.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS



The tables that follow present performance information about Class A Shares of
the Funds. This information is intended to help you understand the Funds'
financial performance for the past five years. Some of this information reflects
financial information for a single Fund share. The total returns in the table
represent the rate that you would have earned (or lost) on an investment in a
Fund, assuming you reinvested all of your dividends and distributions.


This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
public accountants. Their report, along with the Funds' financial statements,
appears in the annual report that accompanies the Funds' SAI. You can obtain the
annual report, which contains more performance information, at no charge by

RISK/RETURN INFORMATION



The Fund is a mutual fund. A mutual fund pools shareholders' money and, using
professional investment managers, invests it in securities.


The Fund has its own investment goal and strategies for reaching that goal. The
Fund's assets are managed under the direction of its Adviser. The Adviser
invests the Fund's assets in a way that it believes will help the Fund achieve
its goal. Still, investing in the Fund involves risk, and there is no guarantee
that the Fund will achieve its goal. In fact, no matter how good a job the
Adviser does, you could lose money on your investment in the Fund, just as you
could with other investments. A Fund share is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.



ALTHOUGH THE FUND IS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00,

IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN THE FUND.




YEAR 2000 RISKS



Like other mutual funds (and most organizations around the world), the Fund
could be affected by computer problems related to the transition to the year
2000. While no one knows if these problems will have any impact on the Fund or
on the financial markets in general, the Fund is taking steps to protect Fund
investors. These include efforts to ensure that the Fund's own systems are
prepared to make the transition to the year 2000, and to determine that the
problem will not affect the systems used by the Fund's mission critical service
providers. The Fund has also sought and received assurances from these service
providers that they are devoting significant resources to prevent material
adverse consequences to the Fund. Whether these steps will be effective can only
be known for certain in the year 2000. While such assurances have been received,
year 2000 problems may ultimately negatively affect the companies and
governments whose securities the Fund purchases, which may have an impact on the
value of the Fund's shares. There is additional information on these risks in
the Statement of Additional Information.

MONEY MARKET FUND







FUND SUMMARY

INVESTMENT GOAL                                   Preserving principal and maintaining liquidity
                                                  while providing current income

SHARE PRICE VOLATILITY                            Very low

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY                     The Fund is professionally managed to provide
                                                  liquidity, diversification and a competitive yield by
                                                  investing in high quality, short-term money market
                                                  instruments












INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The Money Market Fund is comprised of short-term U.S. dollar denominated debt
obligations that are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or that the Adviser
determines are of comparable quality. The Fund invests in: (i) commercial paper
and other short-term corporate obligations of U.S. and foreign issuers,
(including asset-backed securities) rated in the highest short-term rating
category; (ii) certificates of deposit, time deposits, bankers' acceptances,
bank notes and other obligations of U.S. savings and loan institutions, U.S.
commercial banks (including foreign branches of such banks), and U.S. and London
branches of foreign banks, that meet certain asset requirements; (iii)
short-term obligations issued by state and local governments; (iv) obligations
of foreign governments (including Canadian and Provincial Government and Crown
Agency obligations); and (v) U.S. Treasury obligations and obligations issued or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by agencies or instrumentalities of the
U.S. government. The Fund may also enter into fully-collateralized repurchase
agreements.


Using a top-down strategy and bottom-up security selection, the Adviser seeks
securities with an acceptable maturity, that are marketable and liquid, offer
competitive yields, and are issued by issuers that are on a sound financial
footing. The Adviser also considers factors such as the anticipated level of
interest rates and the maturity of individual securities relative to the
maturity of the Fund as a whole. The Fund follows strict Investment Company Act
rules about the credit quality, maturity and diversification of its investments.






WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?



An investment in the Fund is subject to income risk, which is the possibility
that the Fund's yield will decline due to falling interest rates.


Although the Fund's U.S. government securities are considered to be among the
safest investments, they are not guaranteed against price movements due to
changing interest rates. Obligations issued by some U.S. government agencies are
backed by the U.S. Treasury, while others are backed solely by the ability of
the agency to borrow from the U.S. Treasury or by the agency's own resources.


Page 4 of 10





AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS NOT A BANK DEPOSIT. ALTHOUGH THE FUND SEEKS TO
MAINTAIN A CONSTANT PRICE PER SHARE OF $1.00, YOU MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN
THE FUND.






PERFORMANCE INFORMATION



As of October 31, 1999, the Money Market Fund had not commenced operations, and
did not have a performance history.

EXAMPLE



This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and that you sell your
shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that each year Fund
expenses remain the same, and that you reinvest all dividends and distributions.
Although your actual costs and returns might be different, your approximate
costs of investing $10,000 in the Fund would be:








                                                  1 YEAR         3 YEARS         5 YEARS         10 YEARS

THE FUND'S OTHER INVESTMENTS



This prospectus describes the Fund's primary investment strategies. The Fund is
required to invest at least 80% of its assets, but normally will invest 100% of
its assets, in the types of securities described in this prospectus. However,
the Fund also may invest in other securities, use other strategies and engage in
other investment practices, which are described in detail in the Fund's
Statement of Additional Information (SAI).


The investments and strategies described in this prospectus are those that the
Fund uses under normal conditions. During unusual economic or market conditions,
or for temporary defensive or liquidity purposes, the Fund may invest up to 100%
of its assets in cash or cash equivalents that would not ordinarily be
consistent with the Fund's objective. Of course, there is no guarantee that the
Fund will achieve its investment goal.






INVESTMENT ADVISER



The Investment Adviser makes investment decisions for the Fund and continuously
reviews, supervises and administers the Fund's investment program. The Board of
Trustees supervises the Adviser and establishes policies that the Adviser must
follow in its management activities.


Wellington Management Company, LLP ("Wellington"), serves as the Adviser to the
Fund. As of September 30, 1999, Wellington had approximately $217 billion in
assets under management. As of October 31, 1999, the Fund had not commenced
operations and therefore did not pay an advisory fee to Wellington.


John C. Keogh is the portfolio manager of the Fund. Mr. Keogh has been an
investment professional with Wellington since 1983.



PURCHASING AND SELLING FUND SHARES



This section tells you how to purchase or sell (sometimes called "redeem")
shares of the Fund. The Fund offers Class A Shares only to financial
institutions or intermediaries for their own or their customers' accounts. For
information on how to open an account and set up procedures for placing
transactions, please call 1-800-DIAL-SEI.



HOW TO PURCHASE FUND SHARES



You may purchase shares on any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for
business (a Business Day). However, Fund shares cannot be purchased by Federal
Reserve wire on Federal holidays on which wire transfers are restricted.


Financial institutions and intermediaries may purchase Class A Shares by placing
orders with the Fund's Transfer Agent (or its authorized agent). Institutions
and intermediaries that use certain SEI proprietary systems may place orders
electronically through those systems. Cash investments must be transmitted or
delivered in federal funds to the Fund's wire agent by the close of business on
the same day the order is placed. The Fund may reject any purchase order if they
determine that accepting the order would not be in the best interests of the
Fund or its shareholders.


Page 6 of 10





When you purchase or sell Fund shares through certain financial institutions
(rather than directly from the Fund), you may have to transmit your purchase and
sale requests to these financial institutions at an earlier time for your
transaction to become effective that day. This allows these financial
institutions time to process your requests and transmit them to the Fund.


Certain other intermediaries, including certain broker-dealers and shareholder
organizations, are authorized to accept purchase, redemption and exchange
requests for Fund shares. These requests are normally executed at the net asset
value per share (NAV) next determined after the intermediary receives the
request. These authorized intermediaries are responsible for transmitting
requests and delivering funds on a timely basis.


Investors who deal directly with a financial institution or financial
intermediary will have to follow the institution's or intermediary's procedures
for transacting with the Fund. For more information about how to purchase or
sell Fund shares through your financial institution, you should contact your
financial institution directly. Investors may be charged a fee for purchase
and/or redemption transactions effectuated through certain of these
broker-dealers or other financial intermediaries.


The Fund's NAV is calculated once each Business Day at 2:00 p.m., Eastern time.
So, for you to be eligible to receive dividends declared on the day you submit
your purchase order, generally the Fund (or its authorized intermediary) must
receive your purchase order and federal funds (readily available funds) before
the Fund calculates its NAV.



HOW THE FUND CALCULATES NAV



NAV for one Fund share is the value of that share's portion of all of the net
assets in the Fund.


The Fund values its securities by utilizing the amortized cost valuation method
(as described in the SAI). If the Fund thinks amortized cost is unreliable, fair
value prices may be determined in good faith using methods approved by the Board
of Trustees. The Fund expects its NAV to remain constant at $1.00 per share,
although there is no guarantee that the Fund can accomplish this.



HOW TO SELL YOUR FUND SHARES



Holders of Class A Shares may sell shares on any Business Day by following the
procedures established when they opened their account or accounts with their
financial institution or intermediary. You may also sell your shares by
contacting your financial institution or financial intermediary by telephone.
Your financial institution or intermediary may charge you a fee for its
services. The sale price of each share will be the next NAV determined after the
Fund (or its authorized intermediaries) receives your request.



RECEIVING YOUR MONEY



Normally, the Fund will make payment on your sale as promptly as possible after
it receives your request, but it may take up to three Business Days. Your
proceeds will be wired to your bank account.

REDEMPTIONS IN KIND



The Fund generally pays sale (redemption) proceeds in cash. However, under
unusual conditions that make the payment of cash unwise (and for the protection
of the Fund's remaining shareholders) the Fund might pay all or part of your
redemption proceeds in liquid securities with a market value equal to the
redemption price (redemption in kind). It is highly unlikely that your shares
would ever be redeemed in kind, but if they were, you might have to pay
transaction costs to sell the securities distributed to you, as well as taxes on
any capital gains from the sale as with any redemption.



SUSPENSION OF YOUR RIGHT TO SELL YOUR SHARES



The Fund may suspend your right to sell your shares if the NYSE restricts
trading, the SEC declares an emergency or for other reasons. More information
about this is in the SAI.



DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES



SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCo.) is the distributor of the shares of
the Fund. SIDCo. receives no compensation for distributing the Fund's Class A
Shares.


For Class A Shares, shareholder servicing fees, as a percentage of average daily
net assets, may be up to 0.25%. The Distributor has voluntarily agreed to waive
the shareholder servicing fees applicable to Class A Shares of the Fund. The
Distributor has no current intention to discontinue this voluntary waiver.






DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



The Fund declares dividends daily and distributes its income monthly. The Fund
makes distributions of capital gains, if any, at least annually.


You will receive dividends and distributions in the form cash unless otherwise
stated.



TAXES



PLEASE CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT FEDERAL,
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. Below the Fund has summarized some important tax
issues that affect the Fund and its shareholders. This summary is based on
current tax laws, which may change.


The Fund will distribute substantially all of its income and capital gains, if
any. The dividends and distributions you receive may be subject to federal,
state and local taxation, depending upon your tax situation. If so, they are
taxable whether or not you reinvest them. Income distribution are generally
taxable at ordinary interest rates. Capital gains distributions are generally
taxable at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains. EACH SALE OF FUND
SHARES IS A TAXABLE EVENT.



MORE INFORMATION ABOUT TAXES IS IN THE FUND'S SAI.

THE TRUST



SEI Liquid Asset Trust (the "Trust") is a diversified, open-end management
investment company established as a Massachusetts business trust pursuant to a
Declaration of Trust dated July 20, 1981. The Declaration of Trust permits the
Trust to offer separate series ("funds") of units of beneficial interest
("shares") and separate classes of funds. Except for differences between
Class A and Class D shares pertaining to distribution and shareholder servicing
plans, voting rights, dividends and transfer agent expenses, each share of each
portfolio represents an equal proportionate interest in that portfolio with each
other share of that portfolio.


The Trust pays its expenses, including fees of its service providers, audit
and legal expenses, expenses of preparing prospectuses, proxy solicitation
materials and reports to shareholders, costs of custodial services and
registering the shares under federal and state securities laws, pricing,
insurance expenses, litigation and other extraordinary expenses, brokerage
costs, interest charges, taxes and organization expenses.


This Statement of Additional Information relates to the shares of the
following Funds: Treasury Securities, Government Securities, Prime Obligation,
Institutional Cash and Money Market Funds (each a "Fund" and, together, the
"Funds"), and any classes of the Funds. Currently the Institutional Cash and
Money Market Funds are not selling shares.






INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES



TREASURY SECURITIES FUND--The Treasury Securities Fund seeks to preserve
principal and maintain liquidity while providing current income. Under normal
market conditions, the Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations and

issuers (excluding foreign branches of U.S. banks or U.S. branches of foreign
banks): (i) commercial paper rated at least A-1 by S&P or Prime-1 by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") at the time of investment or, if not rated,
determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality; (ii) obligations
(including certificates of deposit, time deposits, bankers' acceptances and bank
notes) of U.S. commercial banks or savings and loan institutions that are
members of the Federal Reserve System or are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, which banks or institutions have total assets of $500
million or more as shown on their most recent public financial statements, at
the time of investment, provided that such obligations are rated in the top two
short-term rating categories by two or more nationally recognized statistical
rating organizations ("NRSROs"), or one NRSRO if only one NRSRO has rated the
security at the time of investment or, if not rated, determined by the Adviser
to be of comparable quality; (iii) short-term corporate obligations rated AAA or
AA by S&P or Aaa or Aa by Moody's at the time of investment or, if not rated,
determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality; (iv) short-term
obligations issued by state and local governmental issuers, which are rated, at
the time of investment, by at least two NRSROs in one of the two highest
municipal bond rating categories, and which carry yields that are competitive
with those of other types of money market instruments of comparable quality;

(v) U.S. Treasury obligations and obligations issued or guaranteed as to
principal and interest by


S-2





agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government; and (vi) repurchase
agreements involving any of the foregoing obligations.


INSTITUTIONAL CASH FUND--The Institutional Cash Fund seeks to preserve
principal and maintain liquidity while providing current income. Under normal
market conditions, the Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasury obligations.


MONEY MARKET FUND--The Money Market Fund seeks to preserve principal and
maintain liquidity while providing current income. Under normal market
conditions, the Fund invests in the following U.S. dollar denominated
obligations: (i) commercial paper issued by U.S. and foreign issuers rated at
the time of investment in the highest short-term rating category by two or more
NRSROs, or one NRSRO if only one NRSRO has rated the security or, if not rated,
determined by the Adviser to be of comparable quality; (ii) obligations
(including certificates of deposit, time deposits, bankers' acceptances and bank
notes) of U.S. savings and loan and thrift institutions, U.S. commercial banks
(including foreign branches of such banks), and U.S. and London branches of
foreign banks, provided that such institutions (or, in the case of a branch, the
parent institution) have total assets of $1 billion or more as shown on their
last published financial statements, at the time of investment;

(iii) short-term corporate obligations issued by U.S. and foreign issuers with a
remaining term of not more than 397 days that issue commercial paper of
comparable priority and security meeting the above ratings; (iv) short-term
obligations issued by state and local governmental issuers which are rated, at
the time of investment, by at least two NRSROs in one of the two highest
municipal bond rating categories, or, if not rated, determined by the Adviser to
be of comparable quality, and which carry yields that are competitive with those
of other types of money market instruments of comparable quality; (v) U.S.
Treasury obligations and obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. Government; (vi) U.S.
dollar denominated obligations of foreign governments, including Canadian and
Provincial Government and Crown Agency obligations; (vii) repurchase agreements
involving any of the foregoing obligations; and (viii) custodial receipts
representing investments in component parts of U.S. Treasury obligations.


The quality, maturity and diversification requirements of the Government
Securities and Prime Obligation Funds are more restrictive than those imposed by
Rule 2a-7. The Government Securities and Prime Obligation Funds may only
purchase securities with a remaining maturity of 365 days or less, and, as a
matter of non-fundamental policy, will maintain a dollar-weighted average
portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. If Shareholders of these Funds elect to
modify the Funds' investment limitations in the future, the Funds could take
advantage of certain provisions in the Rule that are more liberal than the
Funds' policies and that are followed by the Trust's other Funds.






DESCRIPTION OF PERMITTED INVESTMENTS AND RISK FACTORS



ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES--The Prime Obligation and Money Market Funds may
invest in asset-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are securities
secured by non-mortgage assets such as company receivables, truck and auto
loans, leases and credit card receivables. Such securities are generally issued
as pass-through certificates, which represent undivided fractional ownership
interests in the underlying pools of assets. Such securities also may be debt
instruments, which are also known as collateralized obligations and are
generally issued as the debt of a special purpose entity, such as a trust,
organized solely for the purpose of owning such assets and issuing such debt.


Asset-backed securities are not issued or guaranteed by the United States
Government or its agencies or instrumentalities; however, the payment of
principal and interest on such obligations may be guaranteed up to certain
amounts and for a certain period by a letter of credit issued by a financial
institution (such as a bank or insurance company) unaffiliated with the issuers
of such securities. The purchase of asset-backed securities raises risk
considerations peculiar to the financing of the instruments underlying such
securities. For example, there is a risk that another party could acquire an
interest in the obligations superior to that of the holders of the asset-backed
securities. There also is the possibility that recoveries on repossessed


S-3





collateral may not, in some cases, be available to support payments on those
securities. Asset-backed securities entail prepayment risk, which may vary
depending on the type of asset, but is generally less than the prepayment risk
associated with mortgage-backed securities. In addition, credit card receivables
are unsecured obligations of the card holder.


The market for asset-backed securities is at a relatively early stage of
development. Accordingly, there may be a limited secondary market for such
securities.


BANKERS' ACCEPTANCES--The Prime Obligation and Money Market Funds may invest
in bankers' acceptances. A banker's acceptance is a bill of exchange or time
draft drawn on and accepted by a commercial bank. Bankers' acceptances are used
by corporations to finance the shipment and storage of goods and to furnish
dollar exchange. Maturities are generally six months or less.


BANK NOTES--Bank notes are notes used to represent debt obligations issued
by banks in large denominations.


CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT--The Prime Obligation and Money Market Funds may
invest in certificates of deposit. A certificate of deposit is a negotiable,
interest-bearing instrument with a specific maturity. Certificates of deposit
are issued by banks and savings and loan institutions in exchange for the
deposit of funds, and normally can be traded in the secondary market, prior to
maturity.


COMMERCIAL PAPER--The Prime Obligation and Money Market Funds may invest in
commercial paper. Commercial paper is the term used to designate unsecured,
short-term promissory notes issued by corporations and other entities.


COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS--The following descriptions of commercial paper
ratings have been published by Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P"), Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Fitch Investors Service, Inc. ("Fitch"),
Duff & Phelps, Inc. ("Duff"), Thomson BankWatch ("Thomson") and IBCA Limited and
IBCA, Inc. (together, "IBCA").


Commercial paper rated A by S&P is regarded by S&P as having the greatest
capacity for timely payment. Issues rated A are further refined by use of the
numbers 1+, 1 and 2 to indicate the relative degree of safety. Issues rated A-1+
are those with an "overwhelming degree" of credit protection. Those rated A-1,
the highest rating category, reflect a "very strong" degree of safety regarding
timely payment. Those rated A-2, the second highest rating category, reflect a
safety regarding timely payment, but not as high as A-1.


Moody's employs two designations, judged to be high grade commercial paper,
to indicate the relative repayment capacity of rated issuers as follows:








Prime-1  Superior Quality
Prime-2  Strong Quality








The rating Fitch-1 (Highest Grade) is the highest commercial paper rating
assigned by Fitch. Paper rated Fitch-1 is regarded as having the strongest
degree of assurance for timely payment. The rating Fitch-2 (Very Good Grade) is
the second highest commercial paper rating assigned by Fitch which reflects an
assurance of timely payment only slightly lower in degree than the strongest
issues.


The rating Duff-1 is the highest commercial paper rating assigned by Duff.
Paper rated Duff-1 is regarded as having very high certainty of timely payment
with excellent liquidity factors which are supported by ample asset protection.
Risk factors are minor. Paper rated Duff-2, the second highest rating category,
is regarded as having good certainty of timely payment, good access to capital
markets and sound liquidity factors and company fundamentals. Risk factors are
small.


The rating TBW-1 is the highest commercial paper rating assigned by Thomson.
Paper rated TBW-1 indicates a very high likelihood that principal and interest
will be paid on a timely basis. The rating TBW-2


S-4





is the second-highest rating assigned category by Thomson. The relative degree
of safety regarding timely repayment of principal and interest is strong.
However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues rated TBW-1.


The designation A1, the highest rating category established by IBCA,
indicates that the obligation is supported by a very strong capacity for timely
repayment. Those obligations rated A1+ are supported by the highest capacity for
timely repayment. Obligations rated A2, the second highest rating category, are
supported by a strong capacity for timely repayment, although such capacity may
be susceptible to adverse changes in business, economic or financial conditions.


DEMAND INSTRUMENTS--Certain instruments may entail a demand feature which
permits the holder to demand payment of the principal amount of the instrument.
Demand instruments may include variable amount master demand notes.


FIXED INCOME SECURITIES--Fixed income securities are debt obligations issued
by corporations, municipalities and other borrowers. The market value of a
Fund's fixed income investments will change in response to interest rate changes
and other factors. During periods of falling interest rates, the values of
outstanding fixed income securities generally rise. Conversely, during periods
of rising interest rates, the values of such securities generally decline.
Securities with longer maturities are subject to greater fluctuations in value
than securities with shorter maturities. Fixed income securities rated in the
fourth highest rating category lack outstanding investment characteristics, and
have speculative characteristics as well. Changes by an NRSRO in the rating of
any fixed income security and in the ability of an issuer to make payments of
interest and principal also affect the value of these investments. Changes in
the value of a Fund's securities will not affect cash income derived from these
securities but will affect the Fund's net asset value.


Securities held by a Fund that are guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its
agencies or instrumentalities guarantee only the payment of principal and
interest, and do not guarantee the securities' yield or value or the yield or
value of a Fund's shares.


There is a risk that the current interest rate on floating and variable rate
instruments may not accurately reflect existing market interest rates.


FOREIGN SECURITIES--The Money Market Fund may invest in U.S. dollar
denominated obligations of foreign issuers, including foreign branches of U.S.
commercial banks, and of U.S. and London branches of foreign banks. These
instruments may subject the Fund to investment risks that differ in some
respects from those related to investments in obligations of U.S. domestic
issuers. Such risks include future adverse political and economic developments,
the possible imposition of withholding taxes on interest or other income,
possible seizure, nationalization, or expropriation of foreign deposits, the
possible establishment of exchange controls or taxation at the source, greater
fluctuations in value due to changes in exchange rates, or the adoption of other
foreign governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment of
principal and interest on such obligations. Such investments may also entail
higher custodial fees and sales commissions than domestic investments. Foreign
issuers of securities or obligations are often subject to accounting treatment
and engage in business practices different from those respecting domestic
issuers of similar securities or obligations. Foreign branches of U.S. banks and
foreign banks may be subject to less stringent reserve requirements than those
applicable to domestic branches of U.S. banks. Although the Fund's foreign
securities will be denominated in U.S. dollars, their value may be impacted by
the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currency of the
issuer.


GNMA SECURITIES--The Prime Obligation, Money Market and Government
Securities Funds may invest in securities issued by the Government National
Mortgage Association ("GNMA"), a wholly-owned U.S. Government corporation which
guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest. However, any premiums
paid to purchase these instruments are not subject to GNMA guarantees. The
market value


S-5





and interest yield of these instruments can vary due to market interest rate
fluctuations and early prepayments of underlying mortgages.


These securities represent ownership in a pool of Federally insured mortgage
loans. GNMA certificates consist of underlying mortgages with a maximum maturity
of 30 years. However, due to scheduled and unscheduled principal payments, GNMA
certificates have a shorter average maturity and, therefore, less principal
volatility than a comparable 30-year mortgage-backed bond. Since prepayment
rates vary widely, it is not possible to accurately predict the average maturity
of a particular GNMA pool. The scheduled monthly interest and principal payments
relating to mortgages in the pool will be "passed through" to investors. GNMA
securities differ from conventional bonds in that principal is paid back to the
certificate holders over the life of the loan rather than at maturity. As a
result, the Funds will receive monthly scheduled payments of principal and
interest. In addition, the Funds may receive unscheduled principal payments
representing prepayments on the underlying mortgages. Any prepayments will be
reinvested at the then-prevailing interest rate.


Although GNMA certificates may offer yields higher than those available from
other types of U.S. Government Securities, GNMA certificates may be less
effective than other types of securities as a means of "locking in" attractive
long-term rates because of the prepayment feature. Due to this prepayment
feature, GNMA certificates tend not to increase in value as much as most other
debt securities when interest rates decline.


ILLIQUID SECURITIES--Illiquid securities are securities which cannot be
disposed of within seven business days at approximately the price at which they
are being carried on a Fund's books. Illiquid securities include demand
instruments with demand notice periods exceeding seven days, securities for
which there is no active secondary market, and repurchase agreements with
maturities of more than seven days in length.


MUNICIPAL SECURITIES--The Prime Obligation and Money Market Funds may invest
in Municipal Securities. The two principal classifications of Municipal
Securities are "general obligation" and "revenue" issues. General obligation
issues are issues involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and
are payable from the issuer's general unrestricted revenues, although the
characteristics and method of enforcement of general obligation issues may vary
according to the law applicable to the particular issuer. Revenue issues are
payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of
facilities or other specific revenue source. A Fund may also invest in "moral
obligation" issues, which are normally issued by special purpose authorities.
Moral obligation issues are not backed by the full faith and credit of the state
but are generally backed by the agreement of the issuing authority to request
appropriations from the state legislative body. Municipal Securities include
debt obligations issued by governmental entities to obtain funds for various
public purposes, such as the construction of a wide range of public facilities,
the refunding of outstanding obligations, the payment of general operating
expenses, and the extension of loans to other public institutions and
facilities. Certain private activity bonds that are issued by or on behalf of
public authorities to finance various privately-owned or operated facilities are
included within the term "Municipal Securities." Private activity bonds and
industrial development bonds are generally revenue bonds, the credit and quality
of which are directly related to the credit of the private user of the
facilities.


Municipal Securities may also include general obligation notes, tax
anticipation notes, bond anticipation notes, revenue anticipation notes, project
notes, certificates of indebtedness, demand notes, tax-exempt commercial paper,
construction loan notes and other forms of short-term, tax-exempt loans. Such
instruments are issued with a short-term maturity in anticipation of the receipt
of tax funds, the proceeds of bond placements or other revenues. Project notes
are issued by a state or local housing agency and are sold by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. While the issuing agency has the primary
obligation with respect to its project notes, they are also secured by the full
faith and credit of the United States through agreements with the issuing
authority which provide that, if required, the federal government will lend the
issuer an amount equal to the principal of and interest on the project notes.


S-6





The quality of Municipal Securities, both within a particular classification
and between classifications, will vary, and the yields on Municipal Securities
depend upon a variety of factors, including general money market conditions, the
financial condition of the issuer (or other entity whose financial resources are
supporting the securities), general conditions of the municipal bond market, the
size of a particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating(s)
of the issue. In this regard, it should be emphasized that the ratings of any
nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") are general and
are not absolute standards of quality. Municipal Securities with the same
maturity, interest rate and rating(s) may have different yields, while Municipal
Securities of the same maturity and interest rate with different rating(s) may
have the same yield.


An issuer's obligations under its Municipal Securities are subject to the
provisions of bankruptcy, insolvency, and other laws affecting the rights and
remedies of creditors, such as the Federal Bankruptcy Code, and laws, if any,
which may be enacted by Congress or state legislatures extending the time for
payment of principal or interest, or both, or imposing other constraints upon
the enforcement of such obligations or upon the ability of municipalities to
levy taxes. The power or ability of an issuer to meet its obligations for the
payment of interest on and principal of its Municipal Securities may be
materially adversely affected by litigation or other conditions.


MUNICIPAL AND CORPORATE BOND RATINGS--Bonds rated AAA have the highest
rating S&P assigns to a debt obligation. Such a rating indicates an extremely
strong capacity to pay principal and interest. Bonds rate AA also qualify as
high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to pay principal and interest is very
strong, and in the majority of instances, they differ from AAA issues only in
small degree.


Bonds which are rated Aaa by Moody's are judged to be the best quality. They
carry the smallest degree of credit risk and are generally referred to as "gilt
edge." Interest payments are protected by a large, or an exceptionally stable,
margin, and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are
likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair
the fundamentally strong position of such issues. Bonds rated Aa are judged by
Moody's to be of high quality by all standards. Together with bonds rated Aaa,
they comprise what are generally known as high-grade bonds. They are rated lower
than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa
securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or
there may be other elements present which make the long-term risks appear
somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.


Bonds rated AAA are judged by Fitch to be strictly high grade, broadly
marketable, suitable for investment by trustees and fiduciary institutions
liable to but slight market fluctuation other than through changes in the money
rate. The prime feature of an AAA bond is a showing of earnings several times or
many times interest requirements, with such stability of applicable earnings
that safety is beyond reasonable question whatever changes occur in conditions.
Bonds rated AA are judged by Fitch to be of safety virtually beyond question and
are readily salable, whose merits are not unlike those of the AAA class, but
whose margin of safety is less strikingly broad. The issue may be the obligation
of a small company, strongly secured but influenced as to rating by the lesser
financial power of the enterprise and more local type market.


Bonds rated Duff-1 are judged by Duff to be of the highest credit quality
with negligible risk factors; only slightly more than U.S. Treasury debt. Bonds
rated Duff-2, are judged by Duff to be of high credit quality with strong
protection factors. Risk is modest but may vary slightly from time to time
because of economic conditions.


Bonds which are rated AAA are judged by Thomson to be of the highest
category. The ability to repay principal and interest on a timely basis is very
high. Bonds rated AA are judged by Thomson to be of a superior ability to repay
principal and interest on a timely basis, with limited incremental risk compared
to issues rated in the highest category.


S-7





Obligations rated AAA by IBCA have the lowest expectation of investment
risk. Capacity for timely repayment of principal and interest is substantial,
such that adverse changes in business, economic or financial conditions are
unlikely to increase investment risk significantly. Obligations for which there
is a very low expectation of investment risk are rated AA by IBCA. Capacity for
timely repayment of principal and interest is substantial. Adverse changes in
business, economic or financial conditions may increase investment risk albeit
not very significantly.


MUNICIPAL NOTE RATINGS--Moody's highest rating for state and municipal and
other short-term notes is MIG-1 and VMIG-1. Short-term Municipal Securities
rated MIG-1 or VMIG-1 are of the best quality and such securities have strong
protection afforded by established cash flows, superior liquidity support and/or
demonstrated access to the market for refinancing. Short-term Municipal
Securities rated MIG-2 and VMIG-2 are of high quality and their margins of
protection are ample, although not so large as in the preceding group.


An S&P note rating reflects the liquidity concerns and market access risks
unique to notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note
rating. Notes maturing beyond three years will most likely receive a long-term
debt rating. The following criteria will be used in making that assessment.


- Amortization schedule (the larger the final maturity relative to other
maturities, the more likely it will be treated as a note).


- Source of payment (the more dependent the issue is on the market for its
refinancing, the more likely it will be treated as a note).


Note rate symbols are as follows:


SP-1.  Very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest. Those
issues determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics will be given a
plus (+) designation.


SP-2.  Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest.


REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS--The Treasury Securities, Government Securities, Prime
Obligation, and Money Market Funds may enter into repurchase agreements, which
are agreements under which securities are acquired from a securities dealer or
bank subject to resale on an agreed upon date and at an agreed upon price which
includes principal and interest. The Fund involved bears a risk of loss in the
event that the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations
and the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of
the securities held as collateral. Wellington Management Company, LLP (the
"Adviser") enters into repurchase agreements only with financial institutions
which it deems to present minimal risk of bankruptcy during the term of the
agreement based on guidelines established by and periodically reviewed by the
Board of Trustees. These guidelines currently permit the Funds to enter into
repurchase agreements only with approved banks and primary securities dealers,
as recognized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which have minimum net
capital of $100 million, or with a member bank of the Federal Reserve System.
Repurchase agreements are considered to be loans collateralized by the
underlying security. Repurchase agreements entered into by the Funds will
provide that the underlying security at all times shall have a value at least
equal to 102% of the price stated in the agreement. This underlying security
will be marked to market daily. The Adviser monitors compliance with this
requirement. Under all repurchase agreements entered into by the Funds, the
Funds will take actual or constructive possession of the underlying collateral.
However, if the seller defaults, the Funds could realize a loss on the sale of
the underlying security to the extent the proceeds of the sale are less than the
resale price. In addition, even though the Bankruptcy Code provides protection
for most repurchase agreements, if the seller should be involved in bankruptcy
or insolvency proceedings, the Funds may incur delay and costs in selling the
security and may suffer a loss of principal and interest if the Funds are
treated as an unsecured creditor. Repurchase Agreements are considered loans
under the 1940 Act.


S-8





RESTRICTED SECURITIES--Restricted securities are securities that may not be
sold freely to the public absent registration under the Securities Act of 1933
or an exemption from registration. Rule 144A securities are securities that have
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, but which may be traded
between certain institutional investors, including investment companies. The
trust's Board of Trustees is responsible for developing guidelines and
procedures for determining the liquidity of restricted securities and monitoring
the Adviser's implementation of the guidelines and procedures.


SUPRANATIONAL AGENCY OBLIGATIONS--The Money Market Fund may invest in
supranational agency obligations. Supranational agency obligations are debt
obligations established through the joint participation of several governments,
and include the Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank,
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), African
Development Bank, European Economic Community, European Investment Bank, and the
Nordic Investment Bank.


TIME DEPOSITS--A time deposit is a non-negotiable receipt issued by a bank
in exchange for the deposit of funds. Like a certificate of deposit, it earns a
specified rate of interest over a definite period of time; however, it cannot be
traded in the secondary market. Time deposits with maturities of more than seven
days are considered to be illiquid.


U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY OBLIGATIONS--The Government Securities, Prime
Obligation, and Money Market Funds may invest in obligations of agencies of the
United States Government, which consist of obligations issued by, among others,
the Export Import Bank of the United States, Farmers Home Administration,
Federal Farm Credit Bank, Federal Housing Administration, Government National
Mortgage Association, Maritime Administration, Small Business Administration,
and The Tennessee Valley Authority. The Funds may purchase securities guaranteed
by the GNMA, which represent participation in Veterans Administration and
Federal Housing Administration backed mortgage pools. Obligations of
instrumentalities of the United States Government include securities issued by,
among others, Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,
Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Federal Land Banks, Fannie Mae and the United
States Postal Service. Some of these securities are supported by the full faith
and credit of the United States Treasury (E.G., GNMA Securities), others (in
which all Funds permitted to invest in agencies' securities may invest) are
supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the Treasury, and still
others are supported only by the credit of the instrumentality (E.G., Fannie Mae
Securities). Guarantees of principal by agencies or instrumentalities of the
U.S. Government may be a guarantee of payment at the maturity of the obligation,
so that in the event of a default prior to maturity, there might not be a
market, and thus no means of realizing the value of the obligation prior to
maturity. Guarantees as to the timely payment of principal and interest do not
extend to the value or yield of these securities nor to the value of the Fund's
shares. The Funds do not intend to purchase securities issued by the World Bank,
the Inter-American Development Bank or the Asian Development Bank.


U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS--U.S. Treasury obligations consist of bills, notes
and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury as well as separately traded interest and
principal component parts of such obligations, known as Separately Traded
Registered Interest and Principal Securities ("STRIPS"), that are transferable
through the federal book-entry system.


U.S. TREASURY STRIPS--U.S. Treasury STRIPS are sold as zero coupon
securities, which means that they are sold at a substantial discount and
redeemed at face value at their maturity date without interim cash payments of
interest or principal. This discount is accreted over the life of the security,
and such accretion will constitute the income earned on the security for both
accounting and tax purposes. Because of these features, such securities may be
subject to greater interest rate volatility than interest-paying investments.


VARIABLE OR FLOATING RATE INSTRUMENTS--Certain of the Funds may invest in
variable or floating rate instruments. These securities may involve a demand
feature and may include variable amount master demand notes that may be backed
by bank letters of credit. The holder of an instrument with a demand feature may
tender the instrument back to the issuer at par prior to maturity. A variable
amount master demand note is issued pursuant to a written agreement between the
issuer and the holder, its amount may be increased by the holder or decreased by
the holder or issuer, it is payable on demand and the rate of interest varies
based upon an agreed formula. The quality of the underlying credit must, in the
opinion of the Adviser, be equivalent to the long-term bond or commercial paper
ratings applicable to the Fund's permitted investments. The Adviser will monitor
on an ongoing basis the earning power, cash flow,


S-9





and liquidity ratios of the issuers of such instruments and will similarly
monitor the ability of an issuer of a demand instrument to pay principal and
interest on demand.


WHEN-ISSUED SECURITIES--Each Fund may invest in when-issued securities.
These securities involve the purchase of debt obligations on a when-issued
basis, in which case delivery and payment normally take place within 45 days
after the date of commitment to purchase. The Funds will make commitments to
purchase obligations on a when-issued basis only with the intention of actually
acquiring the securities, but may sell them before the settlement date.
When-issued securities are subject to market fluctuation, and no interest
accrues to the purchaser during the period prior to settlement. The payment
obligation and the interest rate that a Fund will receive on the securities are
each fixed at the time the Fund enters into the commitment. Purchasing
obligations on a when-issued basis is a form of leveraging and can involve a
risk that the yields available in the market when delivery takes place may
actually be higher than those obtained in the transaction itself, in which case
the Fund could experience an unrealized loss at the time of delivery.


Segregated accounts comprised of cash or liquid securities will be
established with the custodian for a Fund in an amount at least equal in value
to each such Fund's commitments to purchase when-issued securities. If the value
of these assets declines, the appropriate Fund will place additional liquid
assets in the account on a daily basis so that the value of the assets in the
account is equal to the amount of such commitments.



YEAR 2000



The Trust depends on the smooth functioning of computer systems in almost
every aspect of its business. Like other mutual funds, business and individuals
around the world, the Trust could be adversely affected if the computer systems
used by its service providers do not properly process dates on and after
January 1, 2000 and distinguish between the year 2000 and the year 1900. The
Trust has asked its mission-critical service providers whether they expect to
have their computer systems adjusted for the year 2000 transition, and have
sought and received assurances from each that its system is expected to
accommodate the year 2000 without material adverse consequences to the Trust.
The Trust and its shareholders may experience losses if these assurances prove
to be incorrect or as a result of year 2000 computer difficulties experienced by
issuers of portfolio securities or third parties, such as custodians, banks,
broker-dealers or others with which the Trust does business.



FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS



The following investment limitations are fundamental policies of each Fund
which cannot be changed with respect to a Fund without the consent of the
holders of a majority of that Fund's outstanding shares. The term "majority of
outstanding shares" means the vote of (i) 67% or more of a Fund's shares present
at a meeting, if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of a Fund are present
or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of a Fund's outstanding shares,
whichever is less.


No Fund may:


1. Purchase securities of any issuer (except securities issued or guaranteed by
the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities and any securities
guaranteed thereby) if as a result more than 5% of the total assets of the
Fund (based on fair market value at the time of investment) would be
invested in the securities of such issuer; provided, however, that the
Treasury Securities and Money Market Funds may temporarily invest up to 25%
of their total assets without regard to this restriction as permitted by
Rule 2a-7.


2. Purchase any securities which would cause more than 25% of the total assets
of the Fund to be invested in the securities of one or more issuers
conducting their principal business activities in the same industry,
provided that this limitation does not apply to investments in (a) domestic
banks and (b) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its
agencies and instrumentalities.


3. Borrow money except for temporary or emergency purposes and then only in an
amount not exceeding 10% of the value of the total assets of that Fund. This
borrowing provision is included solely to facilitate the orderly sale of
portfolio Fund securities to accommodate substantial redemption requests if
they should occur and is not for investment purposes. All borrowings will be
repaid before


S-10





making additional investments for that Fund and any interest paid on such
borrowings will reduce the income of that Fund.


4. Make loans, except that any Fund may purchase or hold debt instruments in
accordance with its investment objective and policies and may enter into
repurchase agreements, provided that repurchase agreements maturing in more
than seven days, restricted securities and other illiquid securities are not
to exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the Fund's total assets.


5. Pledge, mortgage or hypothecate assets except to secure temporary
borrowings, as described in the Prospectus, in aggregate amounts not to
exceed 10% of the net assets of such Fund taken at fair market value at the
time such loan is incurred.


6. Invest in companies for the purpose of exercising control.


7. Acquire more than 10% of the voting securities of any one issuer.


8. Purchase or sell real estate, real estate limited partnership interests,
commodities or commodities contracts including futures contracts. However,
subject to its permitted investments, any Fund may purchase obligations
issued by companies which invest in real estate, real estate limited
partnerships, commodities or commodities contracts.


9. Make short sales of securities, maintain a short position or purchase
securities on margin, except that a Fund may obtain short-term credits as
necessary for the clearance of security transactions.


10. Act as an underwriter of securities of other issuers except as it may be
deemed an underwriter in selling a Portfolio security.


11. Purchase securities of other investment companies except as permitted by
the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and, in any event,
may not purchase securities of other open-end investment companies. Under
these rules and regulations, the Funds are prohibited from acquiring the
securities of other investment companies if, as a result of such
acquisition, a Fund owns more than 3% of the total voting stock of an
investment company; securities issued by any one investment company
represent more than 5% of the total Fund assets; or securities (other than
treasury stock) issued by all investment companies represent more than 10%
of the total assets of a Fund. These investment companies typically incur
fees that are separate from those fees incurred directly by a Fund. A
Fund's purchase of such investment companies results in the layering of
expenses such that shareholders would indirectly bear a proportionate share
of such investment companies' expenses, including advisory fees.


12. Issue senior securities (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940)
except in connection with permitted borrowings as described in the
Prospectus and this Statement of Additional Information or as permitted by
rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


13. Purchase or retain securities of an issuer if, to the knowledge of the
Trust, an officer, trustee, partner or director of the Trust or any
investment adviser of the Trust owns beneficially more than of 1% of the
shares or securities of such issuer and all such officers, trustees,
partners and directors owning more than of 1% of such shares or securities
together own more than 5% of such shares or securities.


14. Purchase securities of any company which has (with predecessors) a record
of less than three years' continuing operations, except (i) obligations
issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies or
instrumentalities, or (ii) municipal securities which are rated by at least
two nationally recognized municipal bond rating services, if, as a result,
more than 5% of the total assets (taken at fair market value) of the Fund
would be invested in such securities.


15. Purchase warrants, puts, calls, straddles, spreads or combinations thereof.


16. Invest in interests in oil, gas or other mineral exploration or development
programs.


17. Purchase restricted securities (securities which must be registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 before they may be offered or sold to the
public) or other illiquid securities except as described in the Prospectus
and this Statement of Additional Information.


Except with respect to the limitation on investing in illiquid securities,
the foregoing percentages will apply at the time of the purchase of a security
and shall not be considered violated unless an excess or deficiency occurs or
exists immediately after and as a result of a purchase of such security.

NON-FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS



The following investment limitation is a non-fundamental policy of the Trust
and may be changed without shareholder approval.


1.  The Government Securities and Prime Obligation Funds must maintain an
average dollar-weighted Fund maturity of 90 days or less.



THE ADMINISTRATOR



The Trust and SEI Investment Funds Management ("SEI Management" or the
"Administrator") have entered into a Management Agreement (the "Management
Agreement"). The Management Agreement, provides that SEI Investments Fund
Management (the "Manager") shall not be liable for any error of judgment or
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Trust in connection with the
matters to which the Management Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Manager in
the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard of its duties and
obligations thereunder.


The Management Agreement, unless terminated sooner as provided therein,
shall remain in effect for two years after the date of the Agreement and shall
continue in effect for successive periods of one year if such continuance is
specifically approved at least annually (i) by the Trustees of the Trust and

(ii) by the vote of a majority of the Trustees of the Trust, who are not parties
to the Management Agreement or interested persons (as that term is defined in
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) of any such
party, cast in person at a Board of Trustees meeting called for the purpose of
voting on such approval. The Agreement may be terminated at any time and without
penalty by the Trustees of the Trust or by the Administrator on not less than 30
days' nor more than 60 days' written notice to the other party thereto. Any
notice under the Management Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and
delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party at the designated mailing
address of such party.


The Administrator, a Delaware business trust, has its principal business
offices at Oaks, Pennsylvania 19456. SEI Investments Management Corporation
("SIMC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI Investments Company ("SEI
Investments"), is the owner of all beneficial interest in the Administrator. SEI
Investments and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the Administrator,
are leading providers of funds evaluation services, trust accounting systems,
and brokerage and information services to financial institutions, institutional
investors, and money managers. The Administrator and its affiliates also serve
as administrator or sub-administrator to the following other mutual funds: The
Achievement Funds Trust, The Advisors' Inner Circle Fund, Alpha Select Funds,
Amerindo Funds, Inc., The Arbor Fund, ARK Funds, Armada Funds, Bishop Street
Funds, Boston 1784 Funds-Registered Trademark-, CNI Charter Funds, CUFUND, The
Expedition Funds, First American Funds, Inc., First American Investment Funds,
Inc., First American Strategy Funds, Inc., HighMark Funds, Huntington Funds, The
Nevis Funds, Oak Associates Funds, The Parkstone Advantage Fund, The PBHG Funds,
Inc., PBHG Insurance Series Fund, Inc., The Pillar Funds, SEI Asset Allocation
Trust, SEI Daily Income Trust, SEI Index Funds, SEI Institutional International
Trust, SEI Institutional Investments Trust, SEI Institutional Managed Trust, SEI
Tax Exempt Trust, STI Classic Funds, STI Classic Variable Trust, TIP Funds, and
UAM Funds, Inc. II.


The Administrator has agreed contractually to waive its fee in order to
limit operating expenses of the Funds to not more than .44% of average net
assets of the Class A shares and .84% of average net assets of the Class D
shares. As to the Institutional Cash Fund only, this waiver is voluntary and may
be terminated at any time. Shareholders will be notified in advance if and when
the waiver is terminated. The Administrator will not be required to bear
expenses of any Fund to an extent which would result in the Fund's inability to
qualify as a regulated investment company under provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The term "expenses" is defined in
such laws or regulations, and generally excludes brokerage commissions,
distribution expenses, taxes, interest, litigation and extraordinary expenses.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Funds paid fees
to the Administrator as follows:

THE ADVISER



The Trust and Wellington Management Company, LLP ("WMC") ("the Adviser")
have entered into an investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement")
dated October 30, 1985. The Advisory Agreement provides that the Adviser shall
not be protected against any liability to the Trust or its shareholders by
reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the
performance of its duties or from reckless disregard of its obligations or
duties thereunder.


WMC serves as the investment adviser for each Fund. The Adviser is a
professional investment counseling firm which provides investment services to
investment companies, employee benefit plans, endowments, foundations, and other
institutions and individuals. Under the advisory agreement, the Adviser invests
the assets of the Funds and continuously reviews, supervises and administers
each Fund's investment program. The Adviser is independent of the Administrator
and SEI and discharges its responsibilities subject to the supervision of, and
policies set by, the Trustees of the Trust.


The Adviser and its predecessor organizations have provided investment
advisory services to investment companies since 1928 and to investment
counseling clients since 1960. As of September 30, 1999, the Adviser had
discretionary management authority with respect to approximately $217 billion of
assets, including the assets of the Trust and SEI Liquid Asset Trust, each an
open-end management investment company administered by the Administrator. The
principal address of the Adviser is 75 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts
02109. WMC is a Massachusetts limited liability partnership whose managing
partners are Laurie A. Gabriel, Duncan M. McFarland and John R. Ryan.


The continuance of the Advisory Agreement after the first two (2) years of
the Agreement must be specifically approved at least annually (i) by the vote of
a majority of the outstanding shares of that Fund or by the Trustees, and

(ii) by the vote of a majority of the Trustees who are not parties to the
Advisory Agreement or "interested persons" of any party thereto, cast in person
at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Advisory
Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment, and is
terminable at any time without penalty by the Trustees of the Trust or, with
respect to a Fund, by a majority of the outstanding shares of that Fund, on not
less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' written notice to the Adviser, or by
the Adviser on 90 days' written notice to the Trust.


The Adviser is entitled to a fee for its investment advisory services, which
is calculated daily and paid monthly, at the following annual rates: .075% of
the Trust's daily net assets up to $500 million, and .02% of the Trust's daily
net assets in excess of $500 million. The fee is allocated among the Funds based
upon their relative net assets. WMC may voluntarily waive portions of its fees,
although such waiver is not expected to affect any Fund's total operating
expenses, due to the nature of the Administrator's fee waivers. WMC may
terminate its waiver at any time.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1998, and 1999 the Funds paid the

DISTRIBUTION AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICING



The Trust has adopted a Distribution Agreement for the Funds dated
November 29, 1982. The Trust has also adopted a Class D Distribution Plan (the
"Class D Plan") for the Treasury Securities Fund in accordance with Rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, which regulates the circumstances under which an investment
company may directly or indirectly bear expenses relating to the distribution of
its shares. In this regard, the Board of Trustees has determined that the
Class D Plan and the Distribution Agreement are in the best interests of the
Shareholders. Continuance of the Class D Plan must be approved annually by a
majority of the Trustees of the Trust, and by a majority of the Trustees who are
not "interested persons" of the Trust as that term is defined in the 1940 Act,
and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of a
Distribution Plan or in any agreements related thereto ("Qualified Trustees").
The Class D Plan requires that quarterly written reports of amounts spent under
the Plan and the purposes of such expenditures be furnished to and reviewed by
the Trustees. The Class D Plan may not be amended to increase materially the
amount which may be spent thereunder without approval by a majority of the
outstanding shares of the Fund. All material amendments of the Class D Plan will
require approval by a majority of the Trustees of the Trust and of the Qualified
Trustees.


The Class D Plan provides that the Trust will pay the Distributor a fee on
the Class D shares of the Fund. The Distributor may use this fee for:

(i) compensation for its services in connection with distribution assistance or
provision of shareholder services or (ii) payments to financial institutions and
intermediaries such as banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies
and investment counselors, broker-dealers and the Distributor's affiliates and
subsidiaries as compensation for services or reimbursement of expenses incurred
in connection with distribution assistance or provision of shareholder services.


Except to the extent that the Administrator and/or Adviser benefitted
through increased fees from an increase in the net assets of the Trust which may
have resulted in part from the expenditures, no interested person of the Trust
nor any Trustee of the Trust who is not an interested person of the Trust has or
had a direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of any of the
distribution plans or related agreements.


Although banking laws and regulations prohibit banks from distributing
shares of open-end investment companies such as the Trust, according to an
opinion issued to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") by
the Office of the Controller of the Currency, financial institutions are not
prohibited from acting in other capacities for investment companies, such as
providing shareholder services. Should future legislative, judicial or
administrative action prohibit or restrict the activities of financial
institutions in connection with providing shareholder services, the Trust may be
required to alter materially or discontinue its arrangements with such financial
institutions.


The Funds have adopted a shareholder servicing plan for its Class A shares
(the "Class A Plan"). Under this Plan, the Distributor may perform, or may
compensate other service providers for performing, the following shareholder and
administrative services: maintaining client accounts; arranging for bank wires;
responding to client inquiries concerning services provided on investments;
assisting clients in changing dividend options, account designations and
addresses; sub-accounting; providing information on share positions to clients;
forwarding shareholder communications to clients; processing purchase, exchange
and redemption orders; and processing dividend payments. Under the Service Plan,
the Distributor may retain as a profit any difference between the fee it
receives and the amount it pays to third parties.

PERFORMANCE



From time to time, each Fund may advertise its yield. These figures will be
based on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future
performance.


The current yield of each Fund is calculated daily based upon the seven days
ending on the date of calculation ("base period"). The yield is computed by
determining the net change (exclusive of capital changes) in the value of a
hypothetical pre-existing shareholder account having a balance of one share at
the beginning of the period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting
deductions from shareholder accounts and dividing such net change by the value
of the account at the beginning of the same period to obtain the base period
return and multiplying the result by (365/7). Realized and unrealized gains and
losses are not included in the calculation of the yield.


The Funds compute their effective compound yield by determining the net
changes, exclusive of capital changes, in the value of a hypothetical
pre-existing account having a balance of one share at the beginning of the
period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from shareholder
accounts, and dividing the difference by the value of the account at the
beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return, and then
compounding the base period return by adding 1, raising the sum to a power equal
to 365 divided by 7, and subtracting 1 from the result, according to the
following formula: Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)(365/7) - 1]. The
current and the effective yields reflect the reinvestment of net income earned
daily on portfolio assets.


S-17





Actual yields will depend on such variables as asset quality, average asset
maturity, the type of instruments a Fund invests in, changes in interest rates
on money market instruments, changes in the expenses of the Funds and other
factors.


Yields are one basis upon which investors may compare the Funds with other
money market funds; however, yields of other money market mutual funds and other
investment vehicles may not be comparable because of the factors set forth above
and differences in the methods used in valuing portfolio instruments.


For the seven-day period ended June 30, 1999 the Funds' yield and effective
yield were as follows:

The total return of a Fund refers to the average compounded rate of return
for a hypothetical investment for designated time periods (including, but not
limited to, the period from which the Fund commenced operations through the
specified date), assuming that the entire investment is redeemed at the end of
each period. In particular, total return will be calculated according to the
following formula: P(1 + T) TO THE POWER OF n = ERV, where P = a hypothetical
initial payment of $1,000; T = average annual total return; n = number of years;
and ERV = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the
beginning of the designated time period as of the end of such period.


Based on the foregoing, the average annual total returns for the Funds from
inception through June 30, 1999 and for the one, five and ten year periods ended
June 30, 1999 were as follows:








                                                                          AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN

*  Not in operation during such period.


**  Although the Fund originally commenced operations on December 31, 1986, it
was only open to shareholders for a few days each year. The Fund was closed
on January 2, 1998.






DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE



Securities of the Funds will be valued by the amortized cost method, which
involves valuing a security at its cost on the date of purchase and thereafter
(absent unusual circumstances) assuming a constant amortization to maturity of
any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of fluctuations in general
market rates of interest on the value of the instrument. While this method
provides certainty in valuation, it may result in periods during which value, as
determined by this method is higher or lower than the price a Fund would receive
if it sold the instrument. During periods of declining interest rates, the daily
yield of a Fund may tend to be higher than a like computation made by a company
with identical investments


S-18





utilizing a method of valuation based upon market prices and estimates of market
prices for all of its portfolio securities. Thus, if the use of amortized cost
by the Trust resulted in a lower aggregate portfolio value on a particular day,
a prospective investor in a Fund would be able to obtain a somewhat higher yield
than would result from investment in a company utilizing solely market values,
and existing shareholders in the Fund would experience a lower yield. The
converse would apply in a period of rising interest rates.


The Trust's use of amortized cost valuation and the maintenance of the net
asset value of each Fund at $1.00 are permitted by Rule 2a-7, under the 1940
Act, provided that certain conditions are met. Under Rule 2a-7, a money market
portfolio must maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity in the Fund of 90
days or less and not purchase any instrument having a remaining maturity of more
than 397 days. In addition, money market funds may acquire only U.S. dollar
denominated obligations that present minimal credit risks and that are "eligible
securities," which means they are (i) rated, at the time of investment, by at
least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (one if it is
the only organization rating such obligation) in the highest short-term rating
category or, if unrated, determined to be of comparable quality (a "first tier
security"), or (ii) rated according to the foregoing criteria in the second
highest short-term rating category or, if unrated, determined to be of
comparable quality ("second tier security"). The Adviser will determine that an
obligation presents minimal credit risks or that unrated instruments are of
comparable quality in accordance with guidelines established by the Trustees.
The Trustees must approve or ratify the purchase of any unrated securities. In
addition, investments in second tier securities are subject to the further
constraints that (i) no more than 5% of a Fund's assets may be invested in such
securities in the aggregate, and (ii) any investment in such securities of one
issuer is limited to the greater of 1% of the Fund's total assets or
$1 million.


The regulations also require the Trustees to establish procedures which are
reasonably designed to stabilize the net asset value per unit at $1.00 for each
Fund. However, there is no assurance that the Trust will be able to meet this
objective. The Trust's procedures include the determination of the extent of
deviation, if any, of each Fund's current net asset value per unit calculated
using available market quotations from each Fund's amortized cost price per unit
at such intervals as the Trustees deem appropriate and reasonable in light of
market conditions and periodic reviews of the amount of the deviation and the
methods used to calculate such deviation. In the event that such deviation
exceeds 1/2 of 1%, the Trustees are required to consider promptly what action,
if any, should be initiated, and, if the Trustees believe that the extent of any
deviation may result in material dilution or other unfair results to
shareholders, the Trustees are required to take such corrective action as they
deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce such dilution or unfair results to the
extent reasonably practicable. In addition, if any Fund incurs a significant
loss or liability, the Trustees have the authority to reduce pro rata the number
of shares of that Fund in each shareholder's account and to offset each
shareholder's pro rata portion of such loss or liability from the shareholder's
accrued but unpaid dividends or from future dividends.






PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES



Purchases and redemptions of shares of the Funds may be made on any day the
New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Currently, the following holidays
are observed by the Trust: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day,
Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.


It is currently the Trust's policy to pay all redemptions in cash. The Trust
retains the right, however, to alter this policy to provide for redemptions in
whole or in part by a distribution in kind of readily marketable securities held
by a Fund in lieu of cash. Shareholders may incur brokerage charges on the sale
of any such securities so received in payment of redemptions. However, a
shareholder will at all times be entitled to aggregate cash redemptions from all
Portfolios of the Trust during any 90-day period of up to the lesser of $250,000
or 1% of the Trust's net assets.


A gain or loss for federal income tax purposes may be realized by a taxable
shareholder upon an in-kind redemption depending upon the shareholder's basis in
the shares of the Trust redeemed.


S-19





The Trust reserves the right to suspend the right of redemption and/or to
postpone the date of payment upon redemption for any period during which trading
on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted, or during the existence of an
emergency (as determined by the SEC by rule or regulation) as a result of which
disposal or evaluation of the portfolio securities is not reasonably
practicable, or for such other periods as the SEC may by order permit. The Trust
also reserves the right to suspend sales of shares of the Fund for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange, the Manager, the Adviser, the
Distributor and/or the Custodian are not open for business.



SHAREHOLDER SERVICES (CLASS D SHARES)



STOP-PAYMENT REQUESTS:  Investors may request a stop payment on checks by
providing the Trust with a written authorization to do so. Oral requests will be
accepted provided that the Trust promptly receives a written authorization. Such
requests will remain in effect for six months unless renewed or canceled. The
Trust will use its best efforts to effect stop-payment instructions, but does
not promise or guarantee that such instructions will be effective. Shareholders
requesting stop payment will be charged a $20 service fee per check which will
be deducted from their accounts.


RIGHT OF ACCUMULATION:  A shareholder qualifies for cumulative quantity
discounts when his new investment, together with the current market value of all
holdings of that shareholder in certain eligible Funds reaches a discount level.
See "Purchase and Redemption of Shares" in the Prospectuses for the sales charge
on quantity purchases.


LETTER OF INTENT:  The reduced sales shares are also applicable to the
aggregate amount of purchases made by any such purchaser previously enumerated
within a 13-month period pursuant to a written Letter of Intent provided by the
Distributor, and not legally binding on the signer or a Fund which provides for
the holder in escrow by the Manager of 5% of the total amount intended to be
purchased until such purchase is completed within the 13-month period. A Letter
of Intent may be dated to include shares purchased up to 90 days prior to the
date of the Letter of Intent is signed. The 13-month period begins on the date
of the earliest purchase. If the intended investment is not completed, the
Manager will surrender an appropriate number of the escrowed shares for
redemption.


DISTRIBUTION INVESTMENT OPTION:  Distributions of dividends and capital
gains made by the Funds may be automatically invested in shares of one of the
Funds if shares of the Fund are available for sale. Such investments will be
subject to initial investment minimums, as well as additional purchase minimums.
A shareholder considering the Distribution Investment Option should obtain and
read the prospectus of the Funds and/or classes in which such automatic
investments are to be made and consider the differences in investment objectives
and policies before making any investment.


REINSTATEMENT PRIVILEGE:  A shareholder who has redeemed shares of any of
the Funds has a one-time right to reinvest the redemption proceeds in shares of
the Fund at their net asset value as of the time of reinvestment. Such a
reinvestment must be made within 30 days of the redemption and is limited to the
amount of the redemption proceeds. Although redemptions and repurchases of
shares are taxable events, a reinvestment within such 30-day period in the same
fund is considered a "wash sale" and results in the inability to recognize
currently all or a portion of a loss realized on the original redemption for
federal income tax purposes. The investor must notify the Transfer Agent at the
time the trade is placed that the transaction is a reinvestment.


EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE:  Some or all of the shares of the Fund for which payment
has been received (I.E., an established account) may be exchanged, at their net
asset value, plus any applicable sales charge, for Class D shares of the Trust,
SEI Tax Exempt Trust, SEI Institutional International Trust and SEI
Institutional Managed Trust or at their net asset value for Class D shares of
other Funds of such trusts that do not have sales charges. Exchanges will be
made only after proper instructions in writing or by telephone (an "Exchange
Request") are received for an established account by the Distributor.


S-20





A shareholder may exchange a Fund's Class D shares, for which good payment
has been received, in his account at any time, regardless of how long he has
held his shares.


Each Exchange Request must be in proper form (I.E., if in writing, signed by
the record owner(s) exactly as the shares are registered; if by telephone,
proper account identification is given by the dealer or shareholder of record),
and each exchange must involve either shares having an aggregate value of at
least $1,000 or all the shares in the account. Each exchange involves the
redemption of the shares of a Fund to be exchanged and the purchase of the
shares of the other Fund. Any gain or loss on the redemption of the shares
exchanged is reportable on the shareholder's Federal income tax return, unless
such shares were held in a tax-deferred retirement plan or other tax-exempt
account. If the Exchange Request is received by the Distributor in writing or by
telephone on any Business Day, as defined in the Prospectuses of the Trust,
prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the exchange will be
effective on that day if all the restrictions set forth above have been complied
with at that time. However, payment of the redemption proceeds by the Funds, and
thus the purchase of shares of the other Funds, may be delayed for up to seven
days if the Funds determine that such delay would be in the best interest of all
of its shareholders. Investment dealers which have satisfied criteria
established by the Funds may also communicate a shareholder's Exchange Request
to the Funds subject to the restrictions set forth above. No more than five
exchange requests may be made in any one telephone Exchange Request.



TAXES



The following is only a summary of certain additional federal tax
considerations generally affecting the Funds and their shareholders that are not
described in the Funds' prospectuses. No attempt is made to present a detailed
explanation of the federal, state or local tax treatment of the Funds or their
shareholders and the discussion here and in the Funds' prospectuses is not
intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.



FEDERAL INCOME TAXES



The following discussion of federal income tax consequences is based on the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations
issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this Statement of Additional
Information. New legislation, as well as administrative changes or court
decisions, may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein, and may
have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein.


Each Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company ("RIC") as
defined under Subchapter M of the Code. By following such a policy, each of the
Funds expects to eliminate or reduce to a nominal amount the federal income
taxes to which such Fund may be subject.


In order to qualify for treatment as a RIC, a Fund must distribute annually
to its shareholders at least the sum of 90% of its net interest income
excludable from gross income plus 90% of its investment company taxable income
(generally, net investment income plus the excess of net short-term capital gain
over net long-term capital loss) (the "Distribution Requirement") and also must
meet several additional requirements. Among these requirements are the
following: (i) at least 90% of a Fund's gross income each taxable year must be
derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, and
gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities on foreign
currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in
such stock or securities; (ii) at the close of each quarter of a Fund's taxable
year, at least 50% of the value of its total assets must be represented by cash
and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RIC's, and other
securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to
an amount that does not exceed 5% of the value of a Fund's assets and that does
not represent more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer;
and (iii) at the close of each quarter of a Fund's taxable year, not more than
25% of the value of its assets may be invested in securities (other than U.S.
government securities or the securities of other RIC's) of any one issuer or of


S-21





two or more issuers which are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or
businesses if the Fund owns at least 20% of the voting power of such issuers.


Notwithstanding the Distribution Requirement described above, which only
requires a Fund to distribute at least 90% of its annual investment company
taxable income and does not require any minimum distribution of net capital gain
(the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), a
Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% federal excise tax to the extent it
fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary
income for that year and 98% of its capital gain net income (the excess of short
and long-term capital gains over short and long-term capital losses) for the
one-year period ending on October 31 of that year, plus certain other amounts.
Each Fund intends to make sufficient distributions to avoid liability for the
federal excise tax. A Fund may in certain circumstances be required to liquidate
Fund investments in order to make sufficient distributions to avoid federal
excise tax liability at a time when the investment advisor might not otherwise
have chosen to do so, and liquidation of investments in such circumstances may
affect the ability of a Fund to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a
RIC.


Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange or redemption of shares of a
Fund by a shareholder who is not a dealer in securities will generally, for
individual shareholders, be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares have been held for more than twelve months, and otherwise will be treated
as short-term capital gain or loss. However, if shares on which a shareholder
has received a net capital gain distribution are subsequently sold, exchanged or
redeemed and such shares have been held for six months or less, any loss
recognized will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the net
capital gain distribution. Long-term capital gains are currently taxed at a
maximum rate of 20% and short-term capital gains are currently taxed at ordinary
income tax rates.


If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for any year, all of its taxable income
will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for
distributions to shareholders, and its distributions (including capital gains
distributions) generally will be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its
shareholders, subject to the dividends received deduction for corporate
shareholders.


A Fund will be required in certain cases to withhold and remit to the United
States Treasury 31% of amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) has provided
the Fund either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, (2)
who is subject to backup withholding by the Internal Revenue Service for failure
to properly report such payments of interest or dividends, or (3) who has failed
to certify to the Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup
withholding.



STATE TAXES



A Fund is not liable for any income or franchise tax in Massachusetts if it
qualifies as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Rules of state and local
taxation of dividend and capital gains distributions from RICs often differ from
the rules for federal income taxation described above. Depending upon state and
local law, distributions by the Fund to shareholders and the ownership of shares
may be subject to state and local taxes. Shareholders are urged to consult their
own tax advisers regarding the affect of federal, state and local taxes in their
own individual circumstances.



FUND TRANSACTIONS



The Trust has no obligation to deal with any dealer or group of dealers in
the execution of transactions in portfolio securities. Subject to policies
established by the Trustees, the Adviser is responsible for placing orders to
execute Fund transactions. In placing orders, it is the Trust's policy to seek
to obtain the best net results taking into account such factors as price
(including the applicable dealer spread), size, type and difficulty of the
transaction involved, the firm's general execution and operational facilities,
and the firm's risk in positioning the securities involved. While the Adviser
generally seeks reasonably competitive spreads or commissions, the Trust will
not necessarily be paying the lowest spread or commission available.


S-22





The Trust's policy of investing in securities with short maturities will result
in high portfolio turnover. The Trust will not purchase portfolio securities
from any affiliated person acting as principal except in conformity with the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


It is expected that certain of the Funds may execute brokerage or other
agency transactions through the Distributor, a registered broker-dealer, for a
commission, in conformity with the 1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and rules of the SEC. Under these provisions, the Distributor is permitted to
receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for a Fund
on an exchange if a written contract is in effect between the Distributor and
the Trust expressly permitting the Distributor to receive and retain such
compensation. These provisions further require that commissions paid to the
Distributor by the Trust for exchange transactions not exceed "usual and
customary" brokerage commissions. The rules define "usual and customary"
commissions to include amounts which are "reasonable and fair compared to the
commission, fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other
brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities
being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of
time." In addition, the Fund may direct commission business to one or more
designated broker-dealers, including the Distributor, in connection with such
broker-dealer's payment of certain of the Fund's expenses. The Trustees,
including those who are not "interested persons" of the Trust, have adopted
procedures for evaluating the reasonableness of commissions paid to the
Distributor and will review these procedures periodically.


The Trust does not expect to use one particular dealer, but, subject to the
Trust's policy of seeking the best net results, dealers who provide supplemental
investment research to the Adviser may receive orders for transactions by the
Trust. Information so received will be in addition to and not in lieu of the
services required to be performed by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreements,
and the expenses of the Adviser will not necessarily be reduced as a result of
the receipt of such supplemental information.


The money market securities in which certain of the Funds invest are traded
primarily in the over-the-counter market. Where possible, the Adviser will deal
directly with the dealers who make a market in the securities involved, except
in those circumstances where better prices and execution are available
elsewhere. Such dealers usually are acting as principal for their own account.
On occasion, securities may be purchased directly from the issuer. Money market
securities generally are traded on a net basis and normally do not involve
either brokerage commissions or transfer taxes. The cost of executing portfolio
securities transactions of the Funds will primarily consist of dealer spreads
and underwriting commissions.


Since the Trust does not market its shares through intermediary brokers or
dealers, it is not the Trust's practice to allocate brokerage or principal
business on the basis of sales of its shares which may be made through such
firms. However, the Adviser may place Fund orders with qualified broker-dealers
who recommend the Trust to clients, and may, when a number of brokers and
dealers can provide best price and execution on a particular transaction,
consider such recommendations by a broker or dealer in selecting among
broker-dealers.


The Trust is required to identify any securities of its "regular brokers or
dealers" (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act) which the Trust has acquired
during its most recent fiscal year. For the Trust's fiscal years ended June 30,
1997, 1998 and 1999, no brokerage fees were paid.



DESCRIPTION OF SHARES



The Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number of
shares of each Fund, each of which represents an equal proportionate interest in
that Fund. Each share of a Fund upon liquidation of that Fund entitles a
shareholder to a pro rata share in the net assets of that Fund, after taking
into account certain distribution expenses. Shareholders have no preemptive
rights. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustees of the Trust may
create additional portfolio of shares or classes of portfolio. Any consideration
received by the Trust for shares of any additional Fund and assets in which such
consideration is invested would belong to that Fund and would be subject to the
liabilities related thereto. Share certificates representing the shares will not
be issued.


S-23






LIMITATION OF TRUSTEES' LIABILITY



The Declaration of Trust provides that a Trustee shall be liable only for
his own willful defaults and, if reasonable care has been exercised in the
selection of officers, agents, employees or administrators, shall not be liable
for any neglect or wrongdoing of any such person. The Declaration of Trust also
provides that the Trust will indemnify its Trustees and officers against
liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with actual or threatened
litigation in which they may be involved because of their offices with the Trust
unless it is determined in the manner provided in the Declaration of Trust that
they have not acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that their actions
were in the best interests of the Trust. However, nothing in the Declaration of
Trust shall protect or indemnify a Trustee against any liability for his willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his duties.



VOTING



Where the prospectuses for the Funds or this Statement of Additional
Information state that an investment limitation or a fundamental policy may not
be changed without shareholder approval, such approval means the vote of

(i) 67% or more of the Fund's shares present at a meeting if the holders of more
than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present or represented by
proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the Fund's outstanding shares, whichever is
less.



SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY



The Trust is an entity of the type commonly known as a "Massachusetts
business trust." Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of the Trust could, under
certain circumstances, be held personally liable for the obligations of the
Trust. However, the possibility of the shareholders' incurring financial loss
appears remote because the Trust's Declaration of Trust contains an express
disclaimer of shareholder liability for obligations of the Trust, and requires
that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement, obligation or
instrument entered into or executed by or on behalf of the Trust or the
Trustees. The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification out of the
Trust's property for any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations
of the Trust.






CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES



As of October 1, 1999, the following persons were the only persons who were
record owners (or to the knowledge of the Trust, beneficial owners) of 5% or
more of the shares of the Funds. The Trust believes that most of the shares
referred to below were held by the persons indicated in accounts for their
fiduciary, agency, or custodial customers.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS




DESCRIPTION OF CORPORATE BOND RATINGS



The following descriptions of corporate bond ratings have been published by
Moody's Investor's Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), Standard and Poor's Corporation

("Fitch"), IBCA Limited ("IBCA") and Thomson BankWatch ("Thomson"),
respectively.

DESCRIPTION OF MOODY'S LONG-TERM RATINGS







Aaa        Bonds rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They carry the smallest
           degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt edged". Interest
           payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and
           principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely to change,
           such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
           strong position of such issues.

Aa         Bonds rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards. Together with
           the Aaa group they compare what are generally known as high-grade bonds. They are
           rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection elements may be of
           greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long-term
           risk appear somewhat larger than the Aaa securities.

A          Bonds rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be
           considered as upper-medium grade obligations; Factors giving security to principal
           and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present which suggest a
           susceptibility to impairment some time in the future.

Baa        Bonds rated Baa are considered as medium-grade obligations (I.E., they are neither
           highly protected nor poorly secured). Interest payments and principal security
           appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or
           may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds
           lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative
           characteristics as well.











DESCRIPTION OF S&P'S LONG-TERM RATINGS




INVESTMENT GRADE







AAA        Debt rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by S&P. Capacity to pay interest
           and repay principal is extremely strong.

AA         Debt rated "AA" has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and
           differs from the highest rated debt only in small degree.

A          Debt rated "A" has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal, although
           it is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and
           economic conditions than debt in higher-rated categories.

BBB        Debt rated "BBB" is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and
           repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters,
           adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a
           weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category
           than in higher rated categories.











DESCRIPTION OF DUFF'S LONG-TERM RATINGS







AAA        Highest credit quality. The risk factors are negligible, being only slightly more
           than for risk- free U.S. Treasury debt.

AA+        High credit quality. Protection factors are strong.

AA-        Risk is modest but may vary slightly from time to time because of economic
           conditions.

A+         Protection factors are average but adequate. However,

A-         Risk factors are more variable and greater in periods of economic stress.

BBB+       Below average protection factors but still considered

BBB-       sufficient for prudent investment. Considerable variability in risk during
           economic cycles.

DESCRIPTION OF FITCH'S LONG-TERM RATINGS




INVESTMENT GRADE BOND







AAA        Bonds rated AAA are judged to be strictly high grade, broadly marketable, suitable
           for investment by trustees and fiduciary institutions liable to slight market
           fluctuation other than through changes in the money rate. The prime feature of an
           AAA bond is a showing of earnings several times or many times greater than
           interest requirements, with such stability of applicable earnings that safety is
           beyond reasonable question whatever changes occur in conditions.

AA         Bonds rated AA are judged to be of safety virtually beyond question and are
           readily salable, whose merits are not unlike those of the AAA class, but whose
           margin of safety is less strikingly broad. The issue may be the obligation of a
           small company, strongly secured but influenced as to rating by the lesser
           financial power of the enterprise and more local type market.

A          Bonds rated A are considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality.
           The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be
           strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
           circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.

BBB        Bonds rated BBB are considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit
           quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered
           to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however,
           are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds, and therefore impair timely
           payment. The likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment
           grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.











DESCRIPTION OF IBCA'S LONG-TERM RATINGS







AAA        Obligations rated AAA have the lowest expectation of investment risk. Capacity for
           timely repayment of principal and interest is substantial, such that adverse
           changes in business, economic or financial conditions are unlikely to increase
           investment risk significantly.

AA         Obligations for which there is a very low expectation of investment risk are rated
           AA. Capacity for timely repayment of principal and interest is substantial.
           Adverse changes in business, economic or financial conditions may increase
           investment risk albeit not very significantly.

A          Bonds rated A are obligations for which there is a low expectation of investment
           risk. Capacity for timely repayment of principal and interest is strong, although
           adverse changes in business, economic or financial conditions may lead to
           increased investment risk.

BBB        Bonds rated BBB are obligations for which there is currently a low expectation of
           investment risk. Capacity for timely repayment of principal and interest is
           adequate, although adverse changes in business, economic or financial conditions
           are more likely to lead to increased investment risk than for obligations in other
           categories.

DESCRIPTION OF THOMSON'S LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS




INVESTMENT GRADE







AAA        Bonds rated AAA indicate that the ability to repay principal and interest on a
           timely basis is very high.

AA         Bonds rated AA indicate a superior ability to repay principal and interest on a
           timely basis, with limited incremental risk compared to issues rated in the
           highest category.

A          Bonds rated A indicate the ability to repay principal and interest is strong.
           Issues rated A could be more vulnerable to adverse developments (both internal and
           external) than obligations with higher ratings.

BBB        Bonds rated BBB indicate an acceptable capacity to repay principal and interest.
           Issues rated BBB are, however, more vulnerable to adverse developments (both
           internal and external) than obligations with higher ratings.









DESCRIPTION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS



The following descriptions of commercial paper ratings have been published
by Moody's, Standard and Poor's, Duff and Phelps, Fitch, IBCA and Thomson
BankWatch, respectively.



DESCRIPTION OF MOODY'S SHORT-TERM RATINGS



PRIME-1 Issuers rated Prime-1 (or supporting institutions) have a superior
ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. Prime-1 repayment
ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics:


- Leading market positions in well-established industries.


- High rates of return on funds employed.


- Conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and
ample asset protection.


- Broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high
internal cash generation.


- Well-established access to a range of financial markets and assured
sources of alternate liquidity.


PRIME-2 Issuers rated Prime-2 (or supporting institutions) have a strong
ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. This will normally
be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree.
Earnings trends and coverage ratios, while sound, may be more subject to
variation. Capitalization characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more
affected by external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.





S&P'S SHORT-TERM RATINGS







A-1        This highest category indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely is
           strong. Debt determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics denoted
           with a plus sign (+) designation.

A-2        Capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is satisfactory.
           However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated
           "A-1."








S-30








DESCRIPTION OF DUFF'S SHORT-TERM RATINGS







Duff 1+    Highest certainty of timely payment. Short-term liquidity, including intern
           operating factors and/or access to alternative sources of funds, is outstanding
           and safety is just below risk-free U.S. Treasury short-term obligations.

Duff 1     Very high certainty of timely payment. Liquidity factors are excellent and
           supported by good fundamental protection factors. Risk factors are minor.

Duff 1-    High certainty of timely payment. Liquidity factors are strong and supports good
           fundamental protecting factors. Risk factors are very small.











GOOD GRADE







Duff 2     Good certainty of timely payment. Liquidity factors and company fundamentally
           sound. Although ongoing funding needs may enlarge total financing requirements
           access to capital markets is good. Risk factors are small.











DESCRIPTION OF FITCH'S SHORT-TERM RATINGS







F-1+       Exceptionally Strong Credit Quality. Issues assigned this rating are regarded
           having the strongest degree of assurance for timely payment.

F-1        Very Strong Credit Quality. Issues assigned this rating reflect an assurance
           timely payment only slightly less in degree than issues rated "F-1+."

F-2        Good Credit Quality. Issues assigned this rating have a satisfactory degree
           assurance for timely payment, but the margin of safety is not as great as for
           issues assigned "F-1+" and "F-1" ratings.

LOC        The symbol LOC indicates that the rating is based on a letter of credit issue a
           commercial bank.











DESCRIPTION OF IBCA'S SHORT-TERM RATINGS (UP TO 12 MONTHS)







A1+        Obligations supported by the higher capacity for timely repayment.

A1         Obligations supported by a strong capacity for timely repayment.

A2         Obligations supported by a satisfactory capacity for timely repayment, although
           such capacity may be susceptible to adverse changes in business, economic,
           financial conditions.











DESCRIPTION OF THOMSON'S SHORT-TERM RATINGS







TBW-1      The highest category; indicates a very high likelihood that principal and interest
           will be paid on a timely basis.

TBW-2      The second-highest category; while the degree of safety regarding timely repayment
           of principal and interest is strong, the relative degree of safety is not as for
           issues rated "TBW-1."

ITEM 24.  PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH REGISTRANT:



See the Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information filed
herewith regarding the Trust's control relationships. The Manager is a
subsidiary of SEI Investments Company which also controls the distributor of the
Registrant, SEI Investments Distribution Co., and other corporations engaged in
providing various financial and record keeping services, primarily to bank trust
departments, pension plan sponsors, and investment managers.






ITEM 25.  INDEMNIFICATION:



Article VIII of the Agreement and Declaration of Trust filed as Exhibit 1 to
the Registration Statement is incorporated herewith. Insofar as indemnification
for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to
trustees, directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant by the
Registrant pursuant to the Declaration of Trust or otherwise, the Registrant is
aware that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and, therefore,
is unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or
paid by trustees, directors, officers or controlling persons of the Registrant
in connection with the successful defense of any act, suit or proceeding) is
asserted by such trustees, directors, officers or controlling persons in
connection with the shares being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issues.

Trust's units of beneficial interest, without par value (collectively, the
"Shares"). This opinion is being delivered to you in connection with the Trust's
filing of Post-Effective Amendment No. 24 to the Registration Statement (the
"Amendment") to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Rule 485(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"). With your
permission, all assumptions and statements of reliance herein have been made
without any independent investigation or verification on our part except to the
extent otherwise expressly stated, and we express no opinion with respect to the
subject matter or accuracy of such assumptions or items relied upon.


In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, executed
copies of the following documents:


(a)    a certificate of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as to the
existence and good standing of the Trust;


(b)    the Agreement and Declaration of Trust for the Trust and all
amendments and supplements thereto (the "Declaration of Trust");


(c)    a certificate executed by Todd B. Cipperman, Assistant Secretary
of the Trust, certifying as to, and attaching copies of, the
Trust's Declaration of Trust and

By-Laws (the "By-Laws"), and certain resolutions adopted by the
Board of Trustees of the Trust authorizing the issuance of the
Shares; and


(d)    a printer's proof of the Amendment.


In our capacity as counsel to the Trust, we have examined the originals, or
certified, conformed or reproduced copies, of all records, agreements,
instruments and documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary as the basis
for the opinion hereinafter expressed. In all such examinations, we have assumed
the legal capacity of all natural persons executing documents, the genuineness
of all signatures, the authenticity of all original or certified copies, and the
conformity to original or certified copies of all copies submitted to us as
conformed or reproduced copies. As to various questions of fact relevant to such
opinion, we have relied upon, and assume the accuracy of, certificates and oral
or written statements of public officials and officers or representatives of the
Fund. We have assumed that the Amendment, as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, will be in substantially the form of the printer's proof
referred to in paragraph (d) above.


Based upon, and subject to, the limitations set forth herein, we are of the
opinion that the Shares, when issued and sold in accordance with the Declaration
of Trust and By-Laws, and for the consideration described in the Registration
Statement, will be legally issued, fully paid and nonassessable under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not concede that we are in
the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the 1933
Act.


Very truly yours,
