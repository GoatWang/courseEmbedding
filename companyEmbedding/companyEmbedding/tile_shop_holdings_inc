                Coverage Initiation: Tile Shop Holdings, Inc.


                    Kenneth J. DeFranco, Jr.
                
 | June 24, 2013
                
                






 Value Line has initiated coverage of Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (TTS) in its flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey. The company is a specialty retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance materials, and related accessories in the United States. It offers a wide selection of products, at competitive price levels, while providing customer service in an extensive showroom setting. Presently, the business retails over 4,500 products from around the world, including ceramic, porcelain, glass, and stainless steel manufactured tiles and, marble, granite, quartz, sandstone, travertine, slate, and onyx natural tiles, primarily under its proprietary Rush River and Fired Earth brands. Moreover, Tile Shop makes it a point to buy tile goods and accessories directly from producers, which aids in cost efficiency and quality control. Too, TTS manufactures its own setting and maintenance materials, such as thin set grout and sealers under the Superior brand name. Lastly, the company currently operates 70 stores in 22 states, with an average size of 23,000 square feet per location, while also selling items on its website.
The retail tile market is highly-fragmented. Therefore, Tile Shop competes directly with large national home centers that offer a wide range of home improvement products in addition to tile, such as The Home Depot (HD - Free Home Depot Stock Report) and Lowe’s (LOW); regional and local specialty retailers of tile, including Tile America, World of Tile, Century Tile, Floor and Décor; factory-direct stores like Dal-Tile and Florida Tile, as well as a large number of privately-owned, single-site stores. In addition, it squares off indirectly with businesses that offer other types of floor coverings, namely wood floors, carpet, and vinyl sheets. The barriers to entry for the retail tile industry are relatively low, and new or existing tile retailers could enter Tile Shop’s markets and increase competition fairly easily. Furthermore, it is important to note that many of its competitors enjoy advantages over TTS, most notably wider name recognition, longer operating histories, and greater financial, technical, and other resources. 
That said, the company believes it can compete with respect to each of these factors by providing an extensive product portfolio with attractive prices, as well as convenient retail store locations with solid customer service and on-site instructional guidance. What’s more, while some larger factory-direct entities manufacture their own products, most of its peers purchase their tile from domestic manufacturers or distributors when they receive an order from a customer. Thus, it takes these retailers longer than TTS to deliver goods to customers and their prices tend to be higher.
This stock has been surging upward of late. Indeed, following an initial public offering in November of 2010, the issue began trading on the NASDAQ Exchange in August of 2012. Since then, these shares have jumped more than 120%, compared to just a 20% advance in the S&P 500 Index.
All told, the ongoing housing market recovery augurs well for this company, as it ought to strengthen demand for its offerings. Too, a healthier economy should allow Tile Shop to open additional store fronts and invest in a wider array of products and services. 
All in all, subscribers interested in this specialty retailer of manufactured and stone tiles are advised to consult Value Line’s quarterly reports for Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. as well as any supplemental reports and relevant articles as important news items arise.
At the time of this article’s writing, the author did not have positions in any of the companies mentioned.

                Chris Homeister of The Tile Shop            

                Nancy Kuehn            








 



Chris Homeister has led an impressive turnaround for Plymouth-based retailer Tile Shop Holdings Inc.
Homeister, who once led Best Buy Co. Inc.'s entertainment business group, took over as Tile Shop's CEO after a sluggish 2014 for the company. Since then, he's invested time and resources into tileshop.com and smaller flex-format stores for increased efficiency.

Since 2015, The Tile Shop (NASDAQ: TTS) has increased its store count from about 110 locations to over 130 today. Homeister wants to continue growing that number by 8 to 12 percent annually.
Homeister spoke with the Business Journal recently about how he plans to continue company growth, the company's online showroom and the importance of its smaller-format locations. The conversation was edited for length and clarity. 




How does The Tile Shop plan to continue growing?
We continue to make investments in our online experience. We have customers experience The Tile Shop through the online brand and they can also look at how they can do a room through our digital design studio. We’ve already opened seven new physical stores this year and we’d be looking at 15 to 20 next year. We feel that we can have between 400 to 500 stores across the country.
Where have you opened new stores recently?
We’ve already opened in New Jersey and Maryland. We're opening another store in Arizona and will enter the Houston market later this year with our first store there. Texas is another big market for us regarding future growth.
What is the digital design studio that you mentioned earlier?
One of the things a customer needs help with in many cases is the ability to visualize what tile will look like when it goes into their home. So we’ve implemented this design studio. It’s an online tool that can be used outside the store and it’s free to use. What many consumers are doing is starting a project online in their home and then they come to the store. A store associate can then bring up their saved project to work with them further.





 


Many brick-and-mortar retail stores are closing, partially due to more online shopping. What makes The Tile Shop different?
Great retailers have experiential store environments and you couple that with a strong customer-service element. We want to have high customer service, coupled with great products and have it come alive in an inspirational showroom. I think consumers are constantly telling retailers that in order for me to come to your store, you have to give me an experience that I can’t experience elsewhere.
Are you still focusing on smaller Tile Shop stores?
When I came to the company, the stores were around 23,000 square feet. We changed the store size to be more of a boutique model, if you can use boutique and 15,000 square feet in the same sentence. It’s allowed us to be flexible in the retail real estate market across the country. It allows us to also go into more metropolitan areas to operate efficiently. Even though the store size shrunk by about 30 percent, we still have the same amount of assortment. We’ve had to be smarter with our store products and displays.
