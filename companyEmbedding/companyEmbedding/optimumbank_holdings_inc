                eastern regional news            




                The First N.A., a subsidiary of The First Bancorp Inc., Damariscotta, Maine, and Camden (Maine) National Bank, a subsidiary of Camden National Corp., announced a definitive agreement for The First to purchase the Camden National branch at 63 Union St. in Rockland, Maine. As part of the transaction, The First will acquire deposit accounts in the Rockland location as well as a small volume of loans. In addition, The First has signed a definitive agreement to purchase the 145 Exchange Street building in Bangor, Maine, owned by Camden National. The 63 Union St. branch location in Rockland is one of 15 Maine branches Camden National is acquiring from Bank of America. Camden National is divesting this branch to resolve competitive concerns in that market raised by the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division. In Bangor, The First intends to open a full-service banking center at the 145 Exchange St. location in the first quarter of 2013. On completion of the acquisition, the Camden National branch in Bangor will be relocating from the 145 Exchange St. building to the 80 Exchange St. branch they are purchasing from Bank of America.

Industry: 



OptimumBank was founded November, 2000 by a group of local Broward County businessmen led by Albert Finch and Richard Browdy. They decided to reverse the trend of out of state mega-banks and give the area a true community bank. In the spirit of a "true" community bank, the directors gave local investors, both big and small, a chance to own a piece of the new bank. The bank is initially focusing on traditional in-person banking with business and consumers residing in South Florida. Our customers found a new bank that isn't charging the exorbitant fees they were experiencing at the larger financial institutions, a bank having unmatched expertise in residential and commercial real estate

Our customers found a bank that isn’t charging the exorbitant fees they were experiencing at the larger financial institutions, a bank having unmatched expertise in real estate and commercial lending.
Local banks are becoming rarer in South Florida. It’s the belief of the investors, directors and employees that a combination of internet and traditional community bank is the “optimum” way to bank.
