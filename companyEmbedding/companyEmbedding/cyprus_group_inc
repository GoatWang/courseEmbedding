Cypress Group Inc. - Water Features





































 






Water Features
Gallery


Water features are becoming more popular for outdoor living spaces.  The sight & sound of water has always been profound for humans.  Nothing is more relaxing then coming home from work to sit by your water feature, and have the stress of your day melt away.  New technology makes taking care of water features simpler than in the past.  New pumps, filtration systems, skimmers, and eco-systems have revolutionized the water feature industry.
There are many types of water features:

Waterfalls & Streams - If you want sound, then this is the way to go. The higher the waterfall, the louder it is.
Pondless Waterfalls or Dry Ponds - are one of the easiest to care for, as no filtration system is needed. They are also an excellent choice if safety is a major factor. You get the sound of water from a stream and/or waterfall, but no standing water, as it disappears into the gravel at the bottom. The water re-circulates from top to bottom. The larger the basin below, the less you have to refill it. An auto-fill is an excellent idea for this, so that you don't have to constantly refill the basin (due to evaporation).
Ponds - with fish (Koi or other), or just water plants. If you want to go completely natural - how about an eco-system pond with Koi fish, turtles, and/or water plants?
Pools - more traditional in style, and usually rectilinear.
Weirs, Tishways, Cascades (Arcfalls & Spill Edges) - metal, stone, or plastic. Are used to direct the water and create different decorative types of waterfall effects. Lighted LED plastic weirs are now available in different colors.
Decorative Fountains, Bubblers, Urns, & Spitters - with hidden underground basins to re-circulate the water.
Container Water Gardens - perfect for decks or patios, smaller plastic, resin or ceramic containers filled with water plants.

Limestone - Our native stone in northern Illinois. Limestone is sedimentary, and varies (by quarry) from white, cream, tan or grey in background color. It can have brown, red, pink, lavender or rust veining.
Granite - A very hard stone that is great for countertops, wall stones, & pavers due to its strength, durability, and smoothness (after polishing).  It's colors and patterns vary again by quarry. Granite pavers or walls are expensive.

Bluestone - The trade name for slate.  Bluestone is a sedimentary rock and is made in layers.  It is used for pavers, steps, and stair treads.
Flagstone - Limestone or slate pavers or steppers that are irregular in shape and size.

Types of Natural Forms:
Boulders - Large, more rounded natural stones (from 4" to 6' or larger) for accents, bed edging, or walls.
Outcropping - Large horizontal pieces of natural stone, used to retain slopes, build walls, make steps, or as accents.  They vary in size from small to very large.
Cobblestone - Naturally rounded stones used for bed walls or retaining walls.
Gravel - Small pieces of stone from pea gravel size to 4".
Pebbles - Gravel that has been rounded naturally by water, ice, or wind. 
Types of Manmade Forms:
Top and Wall Caps - Smooth machine cut, to natural edges or surfaces.
Steps - Either machine cut, natural snapped, or outcropping.
Types of Finishes:
Tumbled Pavers - Stone fashioned into paver shapes, and are mechanically tumbled to smooth sharp edges of the paver.
Dimensional or Patterned - Pavers that have been cut into particular rectilinear shapes.
Drywall - Stone pieces that have been snapped by hand or machine and used as wall blocks or bed edging. 
Veneer - Machine-cut pieces of stone used for construction and are lighter in weight.
Thermal Finish - Heat process applied to bluestone to make a more even thickness or surface finish to the paver.
