Byline Bancorp May Seek Acquisitions
Jun 21 17
Byline Bancorp, Inc. could be laying the groundwork for bank acquisitions. Byline Bancorp recently filed a prospectus to raise nearly $80 million through an initial public offering. Certain shareholders plan to sell another $40 million in stock. The offering would also send a message to other area institutions that Byline intends to be a buyer - rather than a seller - in a crowded market that could see a fair share of consolidation in the future. Byline representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.

About

    
            

﻿




Why choose The Bancorp?            
We are a trailblazer in financial services and one of the few companies in the world specialized in providing private label banking and technology solutions to meet the unique business needs of non-bank companies.
 




75,000,000+
prepaid cards in U.S. distribution

100+
private-label non-bank partners

$232 BILLION
combined annual processing volume


You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.
