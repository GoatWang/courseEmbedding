Sara Greenstein





President, UL Supply Chain and Sustainability, Underwriters Laboratories
 					Follow: LinkedIn 

As senior vice president and chief commercial officer at UL, Sara Greenstein was a key strategist on the team that revolutionized the world’s largest not-for-profit safety science company by catapulting UL’s offerings into a for-profit model in 2012. That radical change gave the 120-year old product testing company the capital to fuel the growth of their safety mission in today’s rapidly changing manufacturing arena and, ultimately, continue to thrive in the second century of their business.
Today, she continues to lead the charge as president of supply chain and sustainability at UL by providing her business acumen and leadership skills to the fastest growing business at UL, which includes environment, information and insights, and furniture divisions. Her divisions tackle today’s complex supply chain and sustainability challenges through science-backed, technology-enabled advocacy and solutions.
Prior to her current position, Greenstein was chief marketing and strategy officer, as well as senior vice president and chief commercial officer at UL, with the distinction of being the youngest elected officer in the history of the company.
Before coming to UL, Greenstein was a consultant at Arthur Andersen and was named to Crain’s Chicago Business’s 40 under 40 in 2007. Greenstein holds an MBA from University of Michigan with a BS in business administration from the University of Illinois.

PITTSBURGH, Nov. 20, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:   X) today announced the executive leadership for two of the company's newly created commercial entities.  Effective Dec. 1, 2014, James E. Bruno will lead Automotive Solutions as the senior vice president, and Sara A. Ulbrich-Greenstein will lead Consumer Solutions as the senior vice president.
"I am extremely excited to welcome Jim and Sara to the U. S. Steel executive leadership team.  Their breadth of experience in their respective industries will help lead improvements as the company continues our Carnegie Way transformation journey," said United States Steel President and Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi. "Our commercial entities will better align us with our customers, allowing us to be better business collaborators and earn the right to grow."
Bruno will lead Automotive Solutions, based at the company's Automotive Center in Troy, Mich.  Under his leadership the entity will collaborate with customers to develop solutions utilizing the next generation of advanced high-strength steels (AHSS) to address challenges facing the industry, including increased fuel economy standards and enhanced safety requirements.
Before joining U. S. Steel, Bruno was with TRW Automotive, a global leader in automotive safety and one of the world's largest automotive suppliers, for 20 years.  He has a proven track record of success in leading new products to market – from concept through design and implementation for the competitive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market.  Bruno most recently held the position of vice president – North American braking operations and global slip control portfolio.  Prior to serving as vice president, Bruno held a series of positions of increasing responsibility.  During his career at TRW he led a series of transformations to identify improvements in the value capture process and the material planning process.
Prior to joining TRW, Bruno worked for Eaton Corporation, Robert Bosch Corporation and General Dynamics.  Throughout his career Bruno has managed various engineering and engineering technology programs.  Bruno earned a Bachelor of Science at Purdue University and has a Master of Business Administration from Wayne State University.
Consumer Solutions will be led by Sara Ulbrich-Greenstein.  Under Greenstein's leadership the entity will closely align with customers in the appliance, packaging, container and construction markets. Consumer Solutions will have a robust presence with our tin customers, who represent more than one quarter of the entity's business.  Additional product lines within the unit include the company's COR-TEN AZP®, ACRYLUME®, GALVALUME® and Weathered Metals.  The entity will be based in the Chicago area.
Greenstein joins the company from Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL) where she most recently held the position of president, UL Supply Chain and Sustainability.  Named one of the top 40 executives under 40 years of age by Crain's Chicago Business in 2007, Greenstein has held a series of positions with increasing responsibilities during her 12-year tenure at UL. While at UL she consistently drove profitability within the organization, from developing and launching the UL technology and software businesses to expanding UL's geographic footprint to include Japan, India and China.
Greenstein spent the earlier part of her career in consulting, at both Arthur Andersen Business Consulting and Boston Consulting Group, providing strategic and business transformation guidance to help large, global clients drive profitable growth.  Greenstein earned her Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and received her Master of Business Administration from the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
These commercial entities are part of a larger realignment of United States Steel announced on Nov. 17, 2014, as the company continues The Carnegie Way transformation.
United States Steel Corporation, headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa., is a leading integrated steel producer and Fortune 200 company with major production operations in the United States and Central Europe and an annual raw steelmaking capability of 24.4 million net tons. The company manufactures a wide range of value-added steel sheet and tubular products for the automotive, appliance, container, industrial machinery, construction, and oil and gas industries.

How She Leads: Sara Greenstein, Underwriters Laboratories






How She LeadsHow She Leads: Sara Greenstein, Underwriters LaboratoriesHeather ClancyTuesday, October 21, 2014 - 9:00am














 




Sara Greenstein, UL


How She Leads is a regular GreenBiz feature spotlighting the careers of women who have moved into influential roles in sustainable business.
Sara Greenstein jokes that her first university economics class had more people than the central Illinois farm town where she was raised. Now, she's a self-described global citizen.
As president of UL's supply chain operations and sustainability business units, and a member of the executive team, Greenstein shepherds the company's mission to "bring safe, sustainable and compliant products to the global marketplace." Among two of its biggest accomplishments: an ongoing quest to accelerate adoption of zero-waste strategies and a mission to support more transparency about what's in products consumed around the world.
Greenstein was instrumental in expanding its footprint in Japan, India and China; and more recently was behind the acquisitions of IDES and Innovadex, since combined into a massive materials information database. She landed at UL after several classic business process strategy assignments with the likes of Boston Consulting Group and Arthur Andersen Business Consulting. In her mind, it was a short-term gig.
"Thirteen years later, I am here and have had a lot of various roles," she told GreenBiz. "Through all of them, I've been able to have an impact on our mission and on our business, which I think is the primary thing that has kept me here."
I spoke with Greenstein about what shapes UL's philosophy, and why "sound science" is important for meaningful progress.
Heather Clancy: Give me a sense of UL's reach and where you believe that it has the most impact? 
Sara Greenstein: We have been active pioneers in terms of leadership standards, product certifications and testing methodologies, and sound science that has fed current environmental practices. As we move forward, we're taking that what I call science-backed, technology-enabled capability and embedding it in the supply chain — all the way back to the raw materials and every other link thereafter, to the end product — to help understand broader social impacts, environmental impacts and human health impacts. 
You can only do that when you've got a framework that includes consensus-based standards, that includes third-party verification of performance and efficacy against those standards, and the technology, connectivity and security that's required to link all those various strains in a very global and complex world. From a UL perspective, our mission — I'm sorry, our reach — will only continue to evolve from where we are today, both organically and inorganically. 
Clancy: How have the acquisitions of IDES and Innovadex expanded UL's services?
Greenstein: We are able to provide the technology across the supply chain so decision makers can force products that are healthy, safe [and] sustainable and either formulate (if it's a material, if it's a chemical or chemically formulated product) or design … a product to meet multiple requirements — compliance requirements, perhaps performance requirements, sustainability requirements, and/or individual brand requirements that are being asked of them. 
[Learn more about sustainable supply chains at VERGE SF 2014, Oct. 27-30.]
Where UL Prospector (the combined IDES and Innovadex platform) comes into play is as a public forum where hundreds of thousands of formulators come every day to get technical information they need when determining what materials to buy to formulate a product. Our supply chain software [offers] a very data-secure environment where suppliers provide very important information in a proprietary fashion that enables them to respond to any compliance requirements that are asked of them by any decision maker further down the supply chain. 
A retailer or a brand or a end-product manufacturer has requirements that they demand, whether it's because they have to comply with various regulations around the country or the globe, or because of their own internal policies and requirements. We have a connected, secure mechanism by which we feed that information up and down the chain. We layer our environmental and sustainability standards as filters onto that information. The end result is all about safe, healthy, sustainable products and processes to produce those products.  
Clancy: A moment ago, you referred to growth, organic and otherwise. So can we expect any additional acquisitions?
Greenstein: I think the answer is yes. We are at the beginning of a long journey, and to be honest, the strategy that we are deploying is one that is, I believe, going to continue to grow for decades. From my perspective, and this is something that we talk about pretty intensely here at UL Supply Chain, the whole notion of safe in the broadest sense — safe, secure, sustainable supply chains and the science of sustainability — are to the next century what electrical and fire safety were to the last. We are actively investing and charging hard to do what we can do to solve that safety challenge. It's our mission. 
Clancy: Recognizing that you have a pretty big purview, what would you say is your team's most important priority?
Greenstein: I think the most important priority for the next probably six to 12 months will be to drive consensus in the market amongst the diverse stakeholders around a common set of requirements, all of which improve the state of sustainability, if you will. To get everybody working from the same page, recognizing that continuous improvement can only happen once we've got a common set of criteria and standards from which to work. From that, true innovation and improvement can occur. In the absence of that, there are inefficiencies and therefore less productive work underway for everybody, for everybody along the supply chain. The sooner we can gain consensus with real science and experience around a common set of sustainability and regulatory compliance for major markets, the faster progress can be made. 
Clancy: You've spent a lot of time in Japan, India and China, so how has that impacted your perspective? 
Greenstein: I think one of the most enriching things about my journey here at UL has been that I've become a citizen of the globe, right? So I am as comfortable in the business environment in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, as I am in Germany and Italy and the United States. 
For me, it boils down to what we do here and the reason why we do it, which is to provide safe living and working environments for people around the world. This matters everywhere. At the end of the day, I lead from a place of "I care." I genuinely care about the people who work for me, who work with me, and who we are doing this work for. …
Traveling the world, engaging with clients and colleagues and governments around the world just continues to invigorate why this matters and why we have to have perseverance and succeed here. Because 75 years ago, in the United States, people worried about plugging electronics in. We don’t worry about that here anymore. But we do worry about known carcinogens that our children are absorbing that we are unknowingly causing. If you see a river in China that's totally black because of the chemicals that have leeched into it, or the air there is so thick you can hardly breathe, you absolutely worry.
Being a global citizen of business just reinforces how connected we are, how our basic human needs are all similar, and frankly, why we have a responsibility to address it. 
Clancy: You're going to have more accomplishments in the future, of course, but up to this time, what do you consider to be your most important accomplishment? 
Greenstein: To me, it's my husband and three children. I'll also give you the professional one, but I think for me, having someone who I adore and adores me back kind of helps balance everything. And having three healthy, happy children, I feel blessed and grateful every day for that.
Professionally, I think it's having the opportunity to shape such an impactful business and really have the impact that I think UL has had and is positioned to have, and simultaneously watch the people that work for me grow and develop beyond where I think they probably thought they could. That's what gives me the most satisfaction. 
Clancy: Who has been your most inspirational mentor? 
Greenstein: I'm going to offer the following: I think the most important person who helps me do what I do, the way I do it, is my husband. He serves as everything from sounding board to support to friend and husband. At times, when I am working out what to do or how to do what I know needs to be done, knowing that I have such a strong foundation gives me the extra little push to do what needs to be done. What we do takes courage. There are fewer people who are willing to be brutally honest than I would hope. He's a very steady presence in my life, and I think he has had a big impact in helping me get to where I am. 
Clancy: What advice would you give to someone aspiring to a career similar to yours?
Greenstein: I say first of all listen. I think listening is one of the most life-changing skills — listening to others and listening to yourself. Being able to listen, being willing to ask questions is critical in life and in business. 
And then I would say, be who you are. I've grown up in prominently male-type environments — both in the consulting world and then UL, the engineering firm. … I always encourage people to just be who they are and be less concerned about what they think they should be and be very honest about who they are. Know thyself. If someone is in alignment with who they are and is able to listen to others and themselves, they will succeed because they will be doing something for which they have passion, that they're capable of achieving, and that they enjoy. That is the recipe for success.

Sara Greenstein


   
Whether she's just arrived back from a week of meetings in China or getting ready to jet to Germany or California, Sara Greenstein always finds time for the Bagel.The unpretentious breakfast diner and deli on Broadway in Lakeview has been a Sunday morning ritual for Ms. Greenstein since before she and her husband, Jay, were married 3½ years ago.
These days, they come to the Bagel earlier than they used to in a concession to their 2-year-old son, Matthew, who's yet to appreciate sleeping late on weekends. Ms. Greenstein held Matthew's birthday party at the restaurant and often invites friends to join her there.
"It's accommodated all stages of our lives," she says in between sips of Diet Coke and bites of over-easy eggs. "Now, if I'm flying out on a Sunday, we come on Saturday. I make the best of every moment I have."
STEPHEN J. SERIO
In the past five years, she's managed to shoehorn in personal milestones like getting married and having a child between the non-stop pace of her responsibilities at Northbrook-based product safety testing firm Underwriters Laboratories Inc.
She presides over the sales and business development activities for UL, the nation's preeminent safety certification and testing firm for everything from electric frying pans to fire alarms. She's been a key architect of an overhaul of the century-old non-profit company to make it more entrepreneurial and less bureaucratic.
She's also been the catalyst for UL's expansion overseas in recent years, making the case that the public pressure for more safety standards and product testing in developing countries like China and India presents a big opportunity for UL to increase revenue and its global footprint.
 9 TO 10 A.M.The best time for breakfast at the Bagel.
Colleagues say her opinions carry weight with other senior leaders because she gets results.
"She's able to select a team and lead them and drive solutions," says Sajeev Jesudas, president of UL's international operations. "A lot of leaders fall apart on implementation."
Ms. Greenstein, who was raised on a farm in Central Illinois and now lives in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood, maintains a travel schedule that regularly takes her to the headquarters of some of the world's best-known companies to shore up customer relationships.
When she's not on the road, evenings at home are often spent conversing via e-mail with managers in Japan or China, where it's early in the morning. And she gets to the office by 6 a.m. to catch managers in Europe before they leave for the day.
"She's been very involved in the customer relationships," says Al Scolnik, vice-president for testing services at the Virginia-based National Electrical Manufacturers Assn. "All the trouble issues stop at her desk."
There's been no shortage of those since Ms. Greenstein, a former consultant with Andersen Consulting, arrived at UL in 2002. After decades of having a near monopoly on testing work in the United States, by the late 1990s UL found itself facing several competitors that had sliced its marketshare to about 50%. Manufacturers had started taking products to lesser-known testing labs to avoid UL's notoriously slow and costly testing process.
The company's revenue growth nearly came to a standstill by 2001. For the first time in its history, UL laid off employees, eliminating about 10% of its U.S. workforce by 2004.
Ms. Greenstein was put in charge of realigning the labs into a single organization with separate business units for the company's major markets. To solidify the change, she imposed a standardized price list for testing work. Customer service representatives, instead of engineers, now handle price quotes. The company says that's reduced the wait times to a couple of days from two weeks. The goal is to generate quotes in 24 hours.
That means more globetrotting, while ensuring that her visits to the Bagel will be an oasis of personal time in what has become a 24-hour-a-day career. "There are no such things as holidays, because if there's a U.S. holiday, it's not a holiday in China," she says. "The Bagel serves breakfast all the time."
