How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-LC17 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through Ctfs; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-LC17 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





September 15, 2014 03:57 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-LC17 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$54,856,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$227,433,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96,726,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,183,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$261,974,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$947,054,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,882,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,164,000b class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,849,000b class PEZ 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,803,000b class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$101,967,000a,c class X-B 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91,152,000a,c class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,354,000a,c class X-D 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12,360,000a,c class X-E 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91,152,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,354,000c class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12,360,000c class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 15, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $16,994,000 
      interest-only class X-F, the $37,079,695 interest-only class X-G, the 
      $16,994,000 class G, or the $37,079,695 class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 71 loans secured by 207 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.24 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., German American Capital 
      Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance LLC, Natixis Real Estate Capital 
      LLC, and Silverpeak Real Estate Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 65.0% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 72.4%, and asset summary reviews on 75.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV of 1.17x and 107.9%, respectively, are worse than the 2013 and 
      first-half 2014 averages of 1.29x and 101.6% and 1.19x and 105.6%, 
      respectively.
    

      Less Concentrated Pool: The loan concentration is lower than that of 
      other recent transactions. The three largest loans represent 26.7% of 
      the pool, and the top 10 loans represent 47.6%. The average top 10 
      concentrations for 2013 and first-half 2014 were 54.5% and 52.5%, 
      respectively.
    

      Increased Percentage of Interest-Only Loans. The pool has an 
      above-average concentration of full-term interest-only loans, which 
      represent 26.5% of the total pool balance. This level is higher than the 
      2013 and first-half 2014 averages of 18.3% and 17.1%, respectively. 
      Partial IO loans represent 32.9% of the total pool balance. The pool is 
      scheduled to amortize approximately 13.6% prior to maturity.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.8% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-LC17 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 80 - 81.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners, LLC, 
      rated 'CSS1-'.

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-LC17 commercial mortgage trust pass-through 
      certificates. In addition, the Rating Outlook on four classes was 
      revised to Negative from Stable. A detailed list of rating actions 
      follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The Outlook revisions follow the transfer of three loans to special 
      servicing since the last rating action. These loans represent 2.7% of 
      the current pool balance, the largest of which is the Eagle Ford loan 
      (1.5% of the pool). This loan is secured by a portfolio of three limited 
      service hotels: Hampton Inn & Suites Cotulla, Hampton Inn & Suites 
      Pleasonton, and La Quinta Pearsall, located in close proximity to the 
      Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas. The hotels were built between 2012 
      and 2013. The most recent oil boom saw a significant increase in hotel 
      and multifamily development in the local region, and the subsequent 
      decline in oil prices has led to mass layoffs and decreased spending in 
      the area. At securitization, the subject portfolio's average occupancy 
      was 77%. As of September 2015, the overall occupancy had dropped to 67%, 
      and it is expected that the YE2015 statements will indicate a further 
      decline. The loan transferred to special servicing in February 2016 and 
      is now 90 days delinquent. A workout strategy has not yet been 
      identified, and there is no updated appraisal value available.
    

      The other two loans in special servicing do not individually represent 
      more than 0.9% of the pool. The loans, Georgia Multifamily Portfolio and 
      Cincinnati Portfolio Pool B, are collateralized by class C multifamily 
      properties and are both more than 90 days delinquent.
    

      Fitch is also monitoring the third largest loan, 80 and 90 Maiden Lane 
      (7.4% of the pool) for changes in performance. The loan is secured by 
      two adjacent buildings located at 80 and 90 Maiden Lane in New York 
      City. The collateral consists of 522,918 square feet (sf) (94.7%) of 
      office space and 29,146 sf (5.3%) of retail space. The largest tenant, 
      NYC Department of Investigation, executed an early renewal on its space 
      (19.5% net rentable area [NRA]) in December 2014, extending lease terms 
      to July 2025. The second largest tenant, Office of Child & Family 
      Services, also renewed the lease on its space (8.3% NRA) in January 
      through 2020. Although occupancy has remained stable since issuance, the 
      reported YE2015 net operating income (NOI) represents a 23% decline from 
      the Fitch issuance figure. Based on the servicer's operating statement 
      analysis report (OSAR), this is due to a combination of decreased 
      reimbursements and increased expenses. The loan is interest-only (IO) 
      for the full term, and the NOI debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) on an 
      IO basis was reported to be 1.20x.
    

      Fitch modeled losses of 5.9% of the remaining pool balance; expected 
      losses on the original pool balance total 5.8%. As the transaction is in 
      its first two years of issuance and 2.7% of the pool is in special 
      servicing, the surveillance criteria were applied in determining rating 
      actions. Although very little change has occurred in credit enhancement 
      since issuance, there was one instance of variance from criteria related 
      to class D where Fitch's surveillance criteria would indicate that a 
      downgrade is possible. Fitch determined that downgrades are not 
      warranted at this time in the cycle of the deal, as seasoning is very 
      limited, and there is a sufficient amount of uncertainty surrounding the 
      workout of the specially serviced loans and ongoing performance of the 
      largest watchlisted loan.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch has revised the Outlook of classes E and F to Negative from 
      Stable. The Outlooks of the notional classes X-D and X-E have also been 
      revised to Negative from Stable, as the notional balance of these 
      classes are tied to the outstanding principle balance of classes E and 
      F, respectively. The Negative Outlooks indicate future downgrades to 
      these classes are possible; however, Fitch will continue monitoring the 
      deal, and the above-mentioned loans in particular, for further 
      developments before determining whether or not downgrades are warranted. 
      Rating Outlooks for the remaining classes remain Stable due to the 
      otherwise stable performance of the pool. Upgrades, while not likely in 
      the near term, are possible with increased credit enhancement and 
      sustained improvement to the pool's credit metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms and revises the Rating Outlook on the following classes:
    

      --$29.3 million class E at 'BB-sf', Outlook to Negative from Stable;
    

      --$12.4 million class F at 'B-sf', Outlook to Negative from Stable;
    

      --$29.3 million* class X-D at 'BB-sf', Outlook to Negative from Stable;
    

      --$12.4 million* class X-E at 'B-sf', Outlook to Negative from Stable.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    

      --$39.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;

      Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to COMM 2014-LC17 Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      Pass-Through Ctfs
    





September 29, 2014 05:17 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.'s COMM 2014-LC17 Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust Pass-Through Certificates:
    

      --$54,856,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$227,433,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$261,974,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$947,054,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,882,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,164,000b class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$183,849,000b class PEZ 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,803,000b class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$101,967,000a,c class X-B 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91,152,000a,c class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,354,000a,c class X-D 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12,360,000a,c class X-E 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91,152,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$29,354,000c class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12,360,000c class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      Fitch does not rate the $16,994,000 interest-only class X-F, the 
      $37,079,695 interest-only class X-G, the $16,994,000 class G, or the 
      $37,079,695 class H certificates.
    

      The classes above reflect the final ratings and deal structure. The 
      certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 71 loans secured by 207 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.24 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., German American Capital 
      Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance LLC, Natixis Real Estate Capital 
      LLC, and Silverpeak Real Estate Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 65% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 72.4%, and asset summary reviews on 75.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV of 1.17x and 107.9%, respectively, are worse than the 2013 and 
      first-half 2014 averages of 1.29x and 101.6% and 1.19x and 105.6%, 
      respectively.
    

      Less Concentrated Pool: The loan concentration is lower than that of 
      other recent transactions. The three largest loans represent 26.7% of 
      the pool, and the top 10 loans represent 47.6%. The average top 10 
      concentrations for 2013 and first-half 2014 were 54.5% and 52.5%, 
      respectively.
    

      Increased Percentage of Interest-Only Loans: The pool has an 
      above-average concentration of full-term interest-only loans, which 
      represent 26.5% of the total pool balance. This level is higher than the 
      2013 and first-half 2014 averages of 18.3% and 17.1%, respectively. 
      Partial interest-only loans represent 32.9% of the total pool balance. 
      The pool is scheduled to amortize approximately 13.6% prior to maturity.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.8% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-LC17 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 80-81.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners, LLC, 
      rated 'CSS1-'.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Quicken Loans Ranks Highest in Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction for Seventh Consecutive Year


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 10 Nov. 2016 — Overall satisfaction scores have increased year over year, but a high percentage of home buyers are remorseful about their mortgage lender selection, according to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study,SM released today.The study shows that 21% of customers purchasing a home express regret over their choice of lender, and 27% of first-time home buyers regret their choice. Among customers who regret their decision, there are two distinct situations.The first situation is customers having a poor experience (overall scores below 600 on a 1,000-point scale), which includes an above-average incidence of problems, lack of communication and unmet promises. While this group’s responses aren’t unexpected, they are often vocal about their displeasure, making an average of 9.0 negative comments, compared with the study average of 0.7.The second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high. This group tends to be very price-focused and frequently obtains multiple quotes. Among customers who regret their lender selection, 72% indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product. Their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons, such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm (e.g., checking account with direct deposit).“This ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear,” said Craig Martin, director of the mortgage practice at J.D. Power. “Like a lot of consumers, they are happy with a good deal, but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal. In the end, they may not fully understand exactly what they got, and the longer-term risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future.”One potential contributing factor to this condition could be TRID (TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure[1]).  Over the past two years, much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements, which became effective in October 2015. Lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction. While various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process, findings of the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study show little change in the perceived speed of the process. Improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions.“Whether it is a new regulation, shifting rates or new technology, lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change,” Martin said. “Regardless of what comes, if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers.”Following are some of the key findings in this year’s study:A higher percentage of customers in 2016 indicate their loan representative always called back when promised, compared with last year (85% vs. 81%, respectively), and their loan closed on the desired date (81% vs. 79%).Satisfaction is significantly higher among customers buying a home (840) than among those refinancing (821). In the 2014 and 2015 studies, the levels of satisfaction in these groups were nearly identical.Technology is becoming increasingly important, with 28% of customers indicating they completed their detailed application online, up from 22% in 2015 and 18% in 2014. Study RankingsQuicken Loans ranks highest in primary mortgage origination satisfaction for a seventh consecutive year, with a score of 869. Quicken Loans performs particularly well in the application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; and onboarding factors.CitiMortgage moves up three positions from fifth in 2015 to second this year, with a score of 851.  Ditech Financial, new to the study in 2016, ranks third with a score of 849.Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (+52 points) and Nationstar Mortgage (+50 points) post the most significant year-over-year improvements in overall satisfaction.Advice to ConsumersPlan ahead when researching mortgage options. Satisfaction among customers who wait until they find a home to look into mortgage options is 92 points lower than among those who look into mortgage options before their home search.Take the time to obtain more than one quote. Among the 32% of customers who received just one quote, overall satisfaction is 19 points lower than those who get multiple quotes. Satisfaction is 38 points lower among first-time buyers only getting one quote vs. those who get multiple quotes.Choose a lender based on their merits, not just price or affiliation. Customers who say they chose their lender primarily because of price/rate or based on the recommendation of a realtor/builder are significantly less satisfied than those whose choice is based on other reasons.About the StudyThe 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study measures customer satisfaction with the mortgage origination experience in six factors (listed alphabetically): application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; onboarding; and problem resolution. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale.The study is based on responses from 5,182 customers who originated a new mortgage or refinanced within the past 12 months, and was fielded in July–August 2016.For more information about the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, visithttp://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-primary-mortgage-origination-satisfaction-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
