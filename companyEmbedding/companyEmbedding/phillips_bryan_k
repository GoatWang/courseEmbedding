Philips Airfryer, an easy, healthy way to fry


 
"Cooking healthy shouldn't mean sacrificing taste.  My family and I love using the Philips Airfryer because its unique TurboStar technology makes dishes taste great with amazing texture.  Air is the new oil, and this time-saving tool stays in our kitchen.  It's just like having my own little sous chef that doesn't talk back."
-Gordon Ramsay

Phillips 66 manufactures and markets specialty products designed to support commercial, industrial and wholesale buyers worldwide. The company’s product line includes petroleum coke, waxes, solvents and other products. The company’s base oils help optimize cost and performance of demanding formulations, while the process oils offer top-quality performance and are ideal for use as extenders in rubber, plastics, adhesives and numerous other applications. When it come to converting heavy crude oil into higher value products, delayed coking remains the industry’s leading economical choice. As a licensor that also designs, owns and operates delayed cokers, Phillips 66 is uniquely qualified to offer competitive advantages that others simply cannot match.

Suit slams ex-insiders of Bank of Indiana

December 7, 2013
Chris O'Malley

Racketeering, fraud and “negligent oversight” are juicy ingredients in any lawsuit. But a recently filed complaint against Bank of Indiana may take the trophy in the otherwise sound-but-sleepy world of Indiana banking, not just for the nature of the allegations but that they’re aimed at the boardroom.Read More

Artist StatementI started painting 20 years ago and will paint til my dying day. My style changes often and I have been told to pick a style and stick with it, but I cannot subscribe to that opinion. I don't feel like listening to rock and roll everyday, sometimes I feel like listening to jazz, some days country. Some days I want to paint pop art, some days expressionism. Ideas come and ideas go, so sticking with one style has never suited me, I get bored with it and I wasn't happy doing the same style over and over. Creating. That's my style. Have fun. Enjoy life.
