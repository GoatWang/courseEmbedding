Mesothelioma, lung cancer, colon and colo-rectal cancers, throat cancer, laryngeal cancer, esophageal and asbestosis

Asbestos Exposure and Work History
Creating a thorough work history is vital to a successful asbestos lawsuit. Knowing all the places you worked, such as Middletown  Power, LLC, is crucial to determining all the asbestos products you were exposed to during a lifetime of work.
Documentation detailing asbestos exposure can require thousands of documents and dozens of depositions. Middletown  Power, LLC is one of tens of thousands of job sites in our database. Built over three decades of dedicated mesothelioma, lung cancer and other asbestos cancer work, our extensive database of job sites, asbestos products and supporting documentation allow us to represent those injured by asbestos quickly, effectively and thoroughly.
How can an invoice help my mesothelioma case?
We can prove through documentation—such as old invoices—that a specific asbestos-containing product was used at a specific job site during specific years. Without such evidence, the companies that injured you can continue to deny responsibility. We've already done the leg work to put Middletown  Power, LLC in Middlesex, Connecticut in our knowlegebase, so we won't be scrambling to educate ourselves like a less experienced firm.
What sort of evidence have we accumulated? Blueprints, diagrams, invoices from asbestos product manufacturers, revealing company memos demonstrating their knowledge of the risks, asbestos product packaging through the years, depositions from leading experts, depositions of other asbestos victims throughout Connecticut and medical and scientific literature dating from the late 1800s to the current day.
It's a breadth of knowledge gained from more than 30 years of experience representing Connecticuters injured by asbestos and their families.
