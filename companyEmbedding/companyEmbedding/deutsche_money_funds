Money Market Funds





Yields fluctuate and are not guaranteed. Money market 7-day current yield is the annualized net investment per share for the period shown. The compound yield is calculated similarly but when annualized, the income earned by an investment in the fund is assumed to be reinvested. Gains and losses are not included. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market portfolio than the total return quotation. The nonsubsidized yield reflects what the yield would have been had a fee and/or expense waiver not been in place during the period shown. The fees and/or expenses have been waived in an effort to increase the fund’s net yield. 
Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal fluctuate so your shares may be worth more or less when redeemed. Current performance may differ from the data shown. Adjusted returns reflect the maximum sales charge. Unadjusted returns do not reflect sales charges and would have been lower if they did. For the fund's most recent month-end performance, click the "performance" tab below. Current performance may differ from the data shown.

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 .00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. You should not rely on or expect the Advisor to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain the fund's $1.00 share price. The credit quality of the fund's holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the fund's share price. The fund's share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. The actions of a few large investors in one class of shares of the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the share prices of all classes of shares of the fund. See the prospectus for specific details regarding the fund's risk profile. 

Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional PS*Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional PRS*  Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional MGD* * This is a sub-group of the Deutsche Money Market Series Institutional class. The legacy share class reference is maintained only for recordkeeping, operational convenience and efficiency.
For the above funds  the advisor has agreed to waive expenses. If the advisor had not waived expenses, yields would have been lower. Recent and any future declines in interest rate levels could cause these funds' earnings to fall below the funds' expense ratio, resulting in a negative yield. The advisor has agreed to voluntarily waive expenses as necessary to maintain a positive yield. This waiver may be changed or terminated at any time without notice.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the Prospectus
To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment product. Please read the summary prospectus and prospectus carefully before you invest. 
Nothing contained herein is fiduciary or impartial investment advice that is individualized or directed to any plan, plan participant, or IRA owner regarding the advisability of any investment transaction, including any IRA distribution or rollover.

Global Fund Derivatives Deutsche Bank's Global Fund Derivatives team (GFD) provides the full range of hedge fund products and services: investment products, managed account platforms, secondary market trading, structured finance, risk management, fund distribution, options, and on-line reporting systems. It is the only firm to offer all these services. It was voted the world's best provider of hedge fund products by both Structured Funds magazine and Risk Magazine in 2008. Investment Products: GFD offers investment products linked to more than 600 different hedge funds and over 800 leading global fund of Hedge funds, the largest product range in the market. Investors can select the manager(s) they wish to gain an exposure to, and GFD structures the appropriate product. These products are available in a wide range of formats including UCITSIII funds, certificates, notes, deposits and exchange traded funds (ETFs). Managed Account Platforms: These platforms are used to issue investment products linked to groups of hedge funds and funds of hedge funds. Unlike direct hedge fund investments, the funds are selected by Deutsche to offer the best blend of risk and return, and are overseen by Deutsche Bank using highly sophisticated risk management techniques. Hedge Fund Indices – GFD operates over 30 Synthetic Indices on hedge funds, funds of funds and hedge fund replication. These indices are used to create investment, risk management, benchmarking and financing solutions. Secondary Market Trading: GFD makes markets in a wide range of hedge fund linked investment products. During 2008, it executed over $5 billion of trades, and regularly offered the tightest bid-offer spreads on many securities. Investors in our products can trade them on-line through X-markets with published live daily bid-offer prices (14 hours/ day) Structured Finance: GFD is one the biggest provider of structured financing to hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, family offices and hedge fund investors where the loans are collateralised by their hedge fund portfolios. In 2009, GFD completed transactions for 6 of the top 10 FOHFs in the world, large professional partnerships in US, family offices and ultra HNW individuals in US and Middle East. Risk Management: GFD helps investors to hedge their hedge fund positions and to restructure them where necessary. Fund Distribution: GFD works with hedge funds to raise capital few new funds and to raise additional capital for existing funds, drawing on Deutsche Bank's unique global distribution network. Options – GFD was the first firm to offer short dated (1-2yr) Call Options on Fund of Hedge Funds and single hedge funds (dbX-Liquid Select ), responding to investor demand for short-dated money market-type instruments. On-Line Reporting Systems - One of the key investor concerns about hedge fund linked products is transparency. With many products it is very difficult to obtain up to date performance data, and almost impossible to monitor risk exposures. Our clients don't have that problem. Our dbX-Insight Reporting and db Risk Office tools allow clients to track returns in real time, and to monitor correlation and overlap analysis between FoHFs and single Funds.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

                          Wire Transfer
                        

                          Initiate your wire transfer (also called swift transfer) through remit2india.com so that you can track your wire transfer online at any point in time.
                        

                          You can transfer money from your local bank account to any Deutsche Bank account in India in 48 hours. It eliminates the errors associated with offline wire transfer by giving remitters a printed wire instruction form and a tracking number to track the wire transfer online.
