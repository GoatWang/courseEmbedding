2. The number of underlying securities is based on the stock fund balance on November 18, 2014.

The stock account balance reflected in this report is based on a November 18, 2014 stock fund price of $50.23 per share.
3. Fifty percent of the options become exercisable two years after grant date; the remaining 50%, three years after grant date.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Wisconsin:













Does Vincent, Suzanne M carry a valid contracting license?



All residential and commercial construction in Wisconsin requires a licensed contractor.
Vincent, Suzanne M currently holds license 620-14 (Landscape Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring Vincent, Suzanne M



Licensed contractors in Wisconsin must carry both general liability and workers' compensation insurance, request a copy of current insurance certificates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Vincent, Suzanne M



Licensed contractors in Wisconsin are required to obtain a surety bond.In the event of losses or damages incurred during a construction project,a homeowner can file a claim against a contractors bond.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wisconsin, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
