Read our full Philosophy of Grantmaking
Grant seekers: Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) does not accept unsolicited requests for support. In this way, our staff can dedicate its resources to grantmaking within our defined programs, strategies, and geographies. Thank you for respecting our process.








Arts & Cultures
We help support folk arts, Native American art, music, tactile art, and artistically significant crafts that foster human creativity.
Open panel




Open panel
						Arts & Cultures		


Our focus in Native American and folk arts and cultures supports the intergenerational transference of artistic skill and knowledge, where skills and meaning are rooted in longstanding traditions defined by local communities of practice.


Native Arts & Cultures





Native Arts & Cultures 
Our grantmaking helps ensure that Native arts and cultures of the Upper Midwest, Montana, Idaho, the Pacific Northwest, and the Southwest are more deeply understood, more widely practiced, and more broadly recognized. We strengthen networks of Native artists, supporting their livelihoods and helping communities of practice throughout these regions to thrive sustainably.




Program Highlight: Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art In Terrace, British Columbia, the Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art teaches Native arts and the essential role that art plays in the sustainability and transference of culture. The school focuses on First Nations art of the Pacific Northwest, offering programs in numerous art forms taught by master artists.
The Freda Diesing School has been a MACP grantee since 2012. Independent of the grantmaking relationship, artists and instructors at the school carved three totem poles in traditional form. Commissioned by Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies, the totem poles were formally raised at our home in Minnesota in the fall of 2016.

Folk Arts & Cultures





Folk Arts & Cultures 
We focus on the deep understanding, wide practice, and broad recognition of Scandinavian folk arts and cultures. Initial areas of support include the Scandinavian American folk arts and cultures in the Upper Midwest and Appalachian folk arts and cultures of the Southeast.

Disaster Relief & Recovery
We support work in natural disaster preparedness, relief, and recovery with emphasis on communities prone to low-attention disasters.
Open panel




Open panel
						Disaster Relief & Recovery		


Our grantmaking helps relieve immediate suffering and meets recovery needs in the aftermath of natural disasters around the world. We also focus on preparing vulnerable communities for the impact of potential disasters in their regions.


Preparedness





Preparedness 
Our grantmaking helps communities develop a culture of preparedness to reduce disaster vulnerability, foster self-reliance, and address disaster costs and impacts. This focus will reduce human loss and suffering, decrease economic loss, and enable faster recovery after a natural disaster.




Program Highlight: Midwest Grantee Convening In May 2016, the Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) Disaster Relief & Recovery Domain hosted a convening for all seventeen of our Midwest grantees. While each of the 45 attendees work in the same disaster sector, few have the chance to step back briefly from their important work to interact with peers and discuss key issues affecting their organizations, the region, and the sector. The convening also provided a unique opportunity to interact with MACP staff and senior leadership.
Our relationship with individual grantees provides crucial insights into our grantmaking strategies and ways we can better support their work. Through convenings and other collaborative efforts, MACP hopes that building relationships between grantee organizations will increase the collective impact and effectiveness of our work together in the Midwest region.

Environment
We support the conservation of natural resources and protection of natural habitats.
Open panel




Open panel
						Environment		


Ecosystems from forests to fresh and marine waters to grasslands are vital to the many lives that depend upon them. We support community-based solutions that help address ecosystem degradation at scale.


Coastal Ecosystems


Coastal Ecosystems 

Some of the planet’s greatest concentrations of wildlife and people depend on coral reefs, mangroves, and coastal wetlands for their survival. Our work helps communities in coastal ecosystems develop strategies to sustain themselves in harmony with their environment, particularly in the face of rising sea levels and other climate change impacts.											
Freshwater Ecosystems


Freshwater Ecosystems 

With rising stressors on global water supplies, there is growing demand for conservation programs aiding freshwater systems and the biodiversity they support. Our grantmaking focuses on important river basins and the development of sustainable strategies for the communities who depend on these ecosystems to thrive.											
Tropical Forests





Tropical Forests 
Tropical forests are the most biodiverse of all terrestrial ecosystems. Sustaining these forests is important for many reasons, including mitigating climate change. Our grantmaking helps communities living in tropical rainforests to develop symbiotic strategies to sustain themselves and their vital forest ecosystems.




Program Highlight: CLUA 
An example of putting MACP strategies into practice is our partnership with the Climate and Land Use Alliance (CLUA). Their members share a realization that better land use plays a critical role in addressing the global challenges of climate change.




 
MACP supports CLUA’s work in implementing sustainable, community-based forest management in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Central America. The Alliance’s efforts are focused on supporting the development and implementation of an effective, sustainable, and equitable strategy for cutting forest emissions.




 
Around the world, more than a billion poor rural people depend on forest resources for all or part of their livelihoods. When forests are cleared or degraded, it has an immediate impact on local and indigenous communities.




 MACP grantmaking to CLUA focuses on strengthening community forestry and local capacity. “In many cases, the opportunity to make a global impact on forest loss begins at the community level,” according to CLUA leader, Chris Elliot. “MACP’s commitment, along with the support of other partners, is invaluable in this local-to-global approach, and it’s already beginning to pay dividends.”




Grasslands


Grasslands 

Grasslands, particularly in temperate climates, are among the most vital and yet most overlooked of Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems. Our grantmaking supports grassland-dependent communities with community-based conservation programs and sustainable strategies to preserve these vanishing ecosystems.

Animal Welfare
We focus on the wellbeing of domestic animals and injured wild animals, and ways to increase empathy toward animals among children and adults.
Open panel

						Animal Welfare		


Our funding prioritizes the care of domestic animals and strengthening multigenerational human empathy toward them. We also focus on the care of injured wild animals to improve their odds of returning to the wild or protected areas.


Companion Animals


Companion Animals 

Our grantmaking helps local shelters and animal welfare organizations advance their work in a number of ways including community outreach, spaying/neutering, and sheltering animals in need.											
Empathy Through Accredited Zoos and Aquariums


Empathy Through Accredited Zoos and Aquariums 

Our research has identified educational programs at zoos and aquariums as playing a significant role in fostering strong connections between humans and other animals. This program focuses on children and teens, helping them connect with, appreciate, and develop empathy for animals.											
Wildlife Rehabilitation/Restoration


Wildlife Rehabilitation/Restoration 

We support organizations that help wild animals that are injured, sick, orphaned, or victims of oil spills, with the aim of recovery and release back into their natural habitats. We also support local organizations engaged in habitat restoration projects.

This program focuses on community care integration to allow seniors to age in their homes and communities, workforce development to increase the quality and quantity of the direct-care workforce, and technologies that support care integration.											
Other Grantmaking





Program Highlight: Y-USA 




 Drowning is the second leading cause of injury-related death for children fourteen and under, claiming two or three young lives every day. Unfortunately, children at the highest risk of drowning in America also have the most limited access to facilities that teach water safety. To help put a stop to this epidemic, the YMCA launched its Safety Around Water program in 2015, and the organization continues to make free swim lessons available in underserved communities, in part with funding from MACP.




 “Every year, the Y teaches more than one million children from all backgrounds invaluable water safety and swim skills. This year, we’re committed to addressing the disturbing statistics around fatal youth drownings by making free swim lessons available to more than 27,000 children in underserved communities,” commented Kevin Washington, President and CEO of Y-USA. “It’s our mission to help mitigate the socio-cultural factors that inhibit today’s youth, especially those of color in urban communities, from receiving the potentially lifesaving skills to keep them safe in and around water.”
Since 2013, MACP has provided support to Y-USA for swim scholarships and programs reaching nearly 57,000 youth. With continued support in 2017, that number will increase to 84,750 youth impacted through our partnership with Y-USA on water safety.

ABOUT

Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) supports efforts to enhance quality of life and prevent and relieve suffering of children, families, and seniors; preserve and promote the environment and the arts; and encourage the humane treatment of animals. 
Founded by the late Margaret A. Cargill, MACP actively partners with capable organizations to make a lasting difference for individuals and communities, with particular attention to overlooked causes. MACP’s combined assets (Margaret A. Cargill Foundation and Anne Ray Foundation) place us among the top ten foundations in the United States.
MACP develops and implements integrated grantmaking strategies across seven programmatic areas we call domains: Arts & Cultures, Disaster Relief & Recovery, Environment, Animal Welfare, Quality of Life, Teachers, and Legacy & Opportunity.
Our grantmaking approach is rooted in direction from our founder and reflects our Philosophy of Grantmaking.
Grant proposals are by invitation only, and we do not consider unsolicited requests for support.



OUR APPROACH

Within our domains, our program strategies are anchored in compelling issues where we want to make a meaningful, measurable, and sustainable difference in a defined period of time. 
We limit the number of issues we choose to address, set clear goals for the difference we wish to make on each one, and allocate our resources accordingly. We pay special attention to underserved or low-attention areas and causes, and we favor community-based, on-the-ground programs rather than policy initiatives or endowments.
We continually hone strategies within our domains, investing in evaluation efforts and making substantial learning grants to inform decision-making and program development.
Core to our approach is strengthening the effectiveness and capacity of our key grantee partners by investing in their leadership, management, and operational capabilities.
We believe the best way to make a lasting difference on issues we care about is by investing in long-term relationships with key grantees, strengthening our combined abilities to make a meaningful difference in the world. Because of this, we look to our key grantees as partners, and they help us shape what we do. We work with these partners to find solutions that are consistent with the objectives and values of both our organization and theirs.



Philosophy of Grantmaking

Our grantmaking reflects our values and Margaret Cargill’s guiding principles and is always directed toward our mission and core purposes. 
We expect our grantmaking across all three grantmaking entities to have these characteristics:

We lead with our values, internally and externally.
We partner with capable organizations that have demonstrated their ability to work successfully in our interest areas and in a manner consistent with our values. We look to our grantees as partners and co-learners.
We provide meaningful support to strategic grantees.
We support work in and with communities toward sustainable solutions.
We pay special attention to underserved or low-attention areas, populations, or issues.
We value and affirm the integration of all functions of the Philanthropies in our grantmaking.
We make measurable impact on focused goals.
We evaluate our work, reshape our approaches as we learn, share and apply our learning to future grantmaking.

All this we do, not to bring recognition to ourselves, but to support our grantees in the work they do to provide meaningful assistance and support to society, the arts, and the environment, in a manner consistent with our founder’s wishes and intent. Done well, this will distinguish us.

Our History




Our History


 



Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) is the umbrella over the grantmaking entities funded by the late Margaret Cargill.
Ms. Cargill was a woman of warmth and modesty who used her wealth to support organizations doing work she valued. During her lifetime she made significant, but usually anonymous, donations to organizations globally, nationally, and in Southern California, where she lived most of her adult life.
MACP began with the formation of Akaloa Resource Foundation in 1995. The name Akaloa was selected to preserve our founder’s anonymity and direct attention toward grantees’ good work. That approach remains central to our cultural values today.
Our philanthropic mission began with separate entities, each with distinct grantmaking criteria, but Margaret always envisioned her philanthropy as a whole and she approached her giving with a single philosophy. More than twenty years later, Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies has made her vision a reality with more than $1 billion in cumulative grantmaking.

Our Home










Our Home

A home that reflects our mission
With one of our key philanthropic priorities centered on the environment, we saw our headquarters as a chance to lead by example. In spring 2016, we completed a major building expansion. Through sustainable design practices we tripled our building’s size while reducing its environmental impact.





















A sustainable model
Our building is among the greenest in the country, using 95% reused or recycled materials and designed to the platinum LEED standard for energy conservation and sustainability.





















Recycling our water
The project includes Minnesota’s first greywater drip irrigation system and 19 water storage tanks, which store 55,000 gallons of rainwater to sustain the native plantings, vegetable gardens, and orchards on our property.





















Here comes the sun
Our rooftop photovoltaic and solar thermal panels will provide 15% of the electricity to operate our facility and 70% of the energy to heat our water.









Go to Case Study











Harnessing geothermal energy
The building has an extensive geothermal system that uses the earth’s constant underground temperature for heating and cooling the building. This innovative system is estimated to reduce energy costs by 60-70%.









Go to Case Study











Preserving our backyard
With a protected wetland adjoining our property, and regional parks nearby, we designed our landscaping with water quality in mind. An extensive rain garden, native plantings, and permeable pavers will help ensure effective water management in these sensitive natural areas.

No. 1: Margaret A. Cargill

 

                            Margaret A. Cargill                        




Amount donated in 2011: Approximately $6-billion

Beneficiaries: Anne Ray Charitable Trust and Margaret A. Cargill Foundation
Donor’s background: Ms. Cargill was an heir to the Cargill Corporation fortune. The business was established by her grandfather, William Wallace Cargill, in 1865 and has grown to become one of the largest private companies, with interests in agricultural commodities, food production, and financial and industrial products and services.
Ms. Cargill, who was 85 when she died in 2006, left all of her shares of Cargill stock to be split between the Anne Ray Charitable Trust and the Margaret A. Cargill Foundation, in Eden Prairie, Minn. The amount the two nonprofits are set to receive from the bequest totals roughly $6-billion, but the way the payout is structured is complex.
Because Cargill remains a privately held company, officials at the foundation and the trust could not at first liquidate the private Cargill stock. But that changed last year when the conglomerate sold its 64-percent stake in a publicly traded business called the Mosaic Company. Once the company sold its stake in Mosaic, officials at the nonprofits were able to exchange the private Cargill stock for public Mosaic stock. Under this arrangement, the foundations ended up with about 114.5 million shares of Mosaic stock, which will eventually provide at least $6-billion to the trust and foundation.
To receive some of the bequest money right away, foundation officials last year sold 49.5 million of the Mosaic shares for a total of about $2.8-billion. The nonprofits still own about 65 million Mosaic shares but are not allowed to sell them until May 2013. When the sale of those shares is completed, the philanthropies Ms. Cargill established could become two of the wealthiest grant makers in the United States.
Ms. Cargill established the Anne Ray Charitable Trust in 1997 with about $100-million, to support the American Red Cross, the American Swedish Institute, Berea College, Nature Conservancy, the Public Broadcasting Service, the School for Advanced Research, and the YMCA of the USA.
The Margaret A. Cargill Foundation, established with this bequest, will support a wider array of causes, such as animal welfare; arts and culture; care for the elderly, children, and their families; the environment; and other causes.
Those who knew Ms. Cargill describe her as a quiet donor who loathed public recognition for her largess.
“Margaret, during her lifetime, made almost all of her gifts anonymously,” said Sallie L. Gaines, a spokeswoman for the foundations. “She left very clear directions to our trustees: 'Don’t even think of cranking up the PR machine.’ She didn’t think it was remarkable to be wealthy.”

ABOUT

Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) supports efforts to enhance quality of life and prevent and relieve suffering of children, families, and seniors; preserve and promote the environment and the arts; and encourage the humane treatment of animals. 
Founded by the late Margaret A. Cargill, MACP actively partners with capable organizations to make a lasting difference for individuals and communities, with particular attention to overlooked causes. MACP’s combined assets (Margaret A. Cargill Foundation and Anne Ray Foundation) place us among the top ten foundations in the United States.
MACP develops and implements integrated grantmaking strategies across seven programmatic areas we call domains: Arts & Cultures, Disaster Relief & Recovery, Environment, Animal Welfare, Quality of Life, Teachers, and Legacy & Opportunity.
Our grantmaking approach is rooted in direction from our founder and reflects our Philosophy of Grantmaking.
Grant proposals are by invitation only, and we do not consider unsolicited requests for support.



OUR APPROACH

Within our domains, our program strategies are anchored in compelling issues where we want to make a meaningful, measurable, and sustainable difference in a defined period of time. 
We limit the number of issues we choose to address, set clear goals for the difference we wish to make on each one, and allocate our resources accordingly. We pay special attention to underserved or low-attention areas and causes, and we favor community-based, on-the-ground programs rather than policy initiatives or endowments.
We continually hone strategies within our domains, investing in evaluation efforts and making substantial learning grants to inform decision-making and program development.
Core to our approach is strengthening the effectiveness and capacity of our key grantee partners by investing in their leadership, management, and operational capabilities.
We believe the best way to make a lasting difference on issues we care about is by investing in long-term relationships with key grantees, strengthening our combined abilities to make a meaningful difference in the world. Because of this, we look to our key grantees as partners, and they help us shape what we do. We work with these partners to find solutions that are consistent with the objectives and values of both our organization and theirs.



Philosophy of Grantmaking

Our grantmaking reflects our values and Margaret Cargill’s guiding principles and is always directed toward our mission and core purposes. 
We expect our grantmaking across all three grantmaking entities to have these characteristics:

We lead with our values, internally and externally.
We partner with capable organizations that have demonstrated their ability to work successfully in our interest areas and in a manner consistent with our values. We look to our grantees as partners and co-learners.
We provide meaningful support to strategic grantees.
We support work in and with communities toward sustainable solutions.
We pay special attention to underserved or low-attention areas, populations, or issues.
We value and affirm the integration of all functions of the Philanthropies in our grantmaking.
We make measurable impact on focused goals.
We evaluate our work, reshape our approaches as we learn, share and apply our learning to future grantmaking.

All this we do, not to bring recognition to ourselves, but to support our grantees in the work they do to provide meaningful assistance and support to society, the arts, and the environment, in a manner consistent with our founder’s wishes and intent. Done well, this will distinguish us.

Our History




Our History


 



Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) is the umbrella over the grantmaking entities funded by the late Margaret Cargill.
Ms. Cargill was a woman of warmth and modesty who used her wealth to support organizations doing work she valued. During her lifetime she made significant, but usually anonymous, donations to organizations globally, nationally, and in Southern California, where she lived most of her adult life.
MACP began with the formation of Akaloa Resource Foundation in 1995. The name Akaloa was selected to preserve our founder’s anonymity and direct attention toward grantees’ good work. That approach remains central to our cultural values today.
Our philanthropic mission began with separate entities, each with distinct grantmaking criteria, but Margaret always envisioned her philanthropy as a whole and she approached her giving with a single philosophy. More than twenty years later, Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies has made her vision a reality with more than $1 billion in cumulative grantmaking.

Our Home










Our Home

A home that reflects our mission
With one of our key philanthropic priorities centered on the environment, we saw our headquarters as a chance to lead by example. In spring 2016, we completed a major building expansion. Through sustainable design practices we tripled our building’s size while reducing its environmental impact.





















A sustainable model
Our building is among the greenest in the country, using 95% reused or recycled materials and designed to the platinum LEED standard for energy conservation and sustainability.





















Recycling our water
The project includes Minnesota’s first greywater drip irrigation system and 19 water storage tanks, which store 55,000 gallons of rainwater to sustain the native plantings, vegetable gardens, and orchards on our property.





















Here comes the sun
Our rooftop photovoltaic and solar thermal panels will provide 15% of the electricity to operate our facility and 70% of the energy to heat our water.









Go to Case Study











Harnessing geothermal energy
The building has an extensive geothermal system that uses the earth’s constant underground temperature for heating and cooling the building. This innovative system is estimated to reduce energy costs by 60-70%.









Go to Case Study











Preserving our backyard
With a protected wetland adjoining our property, and regional parks nearby, we designed our landscaping with water quality in mind. An extensive rain garden, native plantings, and permeable pavers will help ensure effective water management in these sensitive natural areas.

Description
ABOUT US The Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies (MACP) is looking for an Office and Facilities Manager to join our team. Based in Eden Prairie, MN, the Philanthropies were established through the generosity of Margaret A. Cargill, a granddaughter of the co-founder of Cargill, Inc. MACP encompasses two grantmaking entities, Margaret A. Cargill Foundation and Anne Ray Foundation, whose collective assets place it among the 10 largest philanthropies in the United States. The organization’s grantmaking supports work in seven domains: Environment, Disaster Relief & Recovery, Arts & Cultures, Quality of Life, Animal Welfare, Teachers, and Legacy & Opportunity. ABOUT OUR HOME Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies is deeply committed to sustainability in its grantmaking, and this extends to the way we inhabit and manage our physical space. In spring 2016, we completed a major building expansion. By focusing on sustainable design practices, we were able to triple our building’s size, while reducing its environmental impact. The original building renovation earned LEED Gold certification. For the expansion, we are proud to pursue LEED Platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Efforts in this area include:  Reused or recycled more than 95% of the materials from our original site, and construction focused on sustainable, recycled, and regionally-sourced products. A remarkable geothermal system heats and cools our space. And an innovative greywater drip irrigation system and network of rainwater storage tanks water our gardens, including a green roof. With a protected wetland adjoining our property, and a regional park nearby, we designed our landscaping with water quality in mind. An extensive rain garden, native plantings, and permeable pavers will help ensure effective water management in these sensitive natural areas.  Additional information can be found on our website: http://www.macphilanthropies.org/about/#our-home JOB PURPOSE The Office & Facilities Manager manages the day-to-day operations of the Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies campus, The Preserve, in a manner consistent with our mission and values. As the campus is designed to be environmentally friendly, the Manager oversees the building and landscape to ensure effective resource management and compliance, while collecting data regarding energy efficiency and environmental sustainability and sharing internally and externally as appropriate.  This position oversees a complete preventative maintenance program for all components of the Preserve and ensures effective facility operations, space utilization, security and life safety programs, emergency preparedness and services, environmental compliance, and energy management. In partnership with Leadership, the Manager develops short- and long-range facility utilization plans and facility budgets. This position builds long-term partnerships with vendors and manages multiple and varied vendor contracts. Directing and occasionally performing tasks related to HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and custodial, the Manager leads projects for capital construction and building improvements.  The Manager thinks proactively about the needs of the organization from a facilities perspective and provides creative solutions to identified needs, maximizing workplace efficiencies, cost effective solutions, and energy conscious/environmentally responsible improvements. Developing and implementing programs to maximize the utilization of facility assets, the Manager is responsible for the installation and ongoing maintenance of all art and signage, as well as office services including reception, travel services, workroom and office supplies, and kitchen and pantry supplies. In partnership with Human Resources, the Manager plans and executes building space use, allocation, and layout and manages ergonomics of workstations to provide a healthy, comfortable and productive workplace for all employees. The Manager contributes to effective internal communication regarding the Preserve’s physical spaces and its relation to mission, culture, values and sustainable practices. The Manager leads the Office & Facilities team of 2 employees and 2 workers with developmental disabilities in partnership with a local non-profit organization. The team sets high standards for working well together in an effective and customer-service oriented manner to support the work of the Philanthropies.  In addition, this position manages the multiple vendors responsible for the maintenance of facility elements (e.g., mechanical, lighting, security, HVAC, landscaping). This position reports to the Director, HR & Administration and is a member of the Human Resources & Administration Team, which includes employees from Human Resources, Information Technology, Project Implementation and Office & Facilities.
