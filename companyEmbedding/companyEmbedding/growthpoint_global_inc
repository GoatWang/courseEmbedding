The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

About Us









About Us


Marketing Driven By Results, that is not just our tagline - it is our purpose!  GrowthPoint was created from our experience in running businesses.  We were frustrated because it was impossible to link marketing expenses to business results with metrics. We were treating marketing as an expense, not an investment.  GrowthPoint was built on the fundamental fact that marketing can be measured and tied to business results.  We developed the technology and processes to do just that!  Every tactic we develop and execute has a scorecard that helps us predict results and measure success.
We treat marketing as a continuous measurable process.  We have a well-defined process, with every step focused on the goal of moving your prospects towards buying your product and solutions.  Anyone who’s been part of a manufacturing process improvement project knows that if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.  That’s true for both marketing and manufacturing. 


At GrowthPoint we take a "Hollywood" approach to our services. For every movie, the producer assembles a custom team of the perfect talent.  We do the same for you.  As a virtual agency, we assemble the right team of experts that will include your GrowthPoint contact and other internal talent, plus whatever outside professionals are required. We keep our staff small to ensure we will hire the talent you need.  We keep our staff small and our overhead smaller.  No fancy lobby.  No artwork on the walls.  Instead, we invest our capital in technology and resources that directly benefit you. 

















Our Business Model
GrowthPoint is a full-service marketing, media and lead management software & service firm that specializes in helping marketing organizations manage the complexity of fully-integrated, end-to-end marketing initiatives.  From concept to implementation through database management and analysis, GrowthPoint helps you create quantifiable results with a meticulous focus on customer connections.  Customer Connections that assure: strategy, message, content and workflow produce winning results for our clients!
 
Our Team
Bruce Hammond, Founder


Before founding GrowthPoint Inc. in 2003, Bruce was President of the North American Automotive and Robotics Division of ABB Corporation, one of the world's largest automation manufacturers.  As president, Bruce grew the business 43% in a down market by tightly aligning sales resources with the targeted segment buying cycle.  The result was the ability to deliver solutions in a highly competitive market.  During this time he also lowered overhead costs by 30% utilizing continuous improvement methodologies, including Lean Six Sigma. 
Previous experience includes 24 years at Rockwell Automation and Allen-Bradley, where Bruce held positions in operations, sales, alliance management, channel development and sales process management in multiple business units.  He also managed the implementation of a comprehensive point-of-sales and CRM system implementation.  During this time, Bruce built a reputation of aligning the company to key customer segments and building processes which continually improved financial performance of the organization. 
In his last role at Rockwell, Bruce was VP of the Process Business, one of four key growth areas for the company.  In this role he grew the business at a 32% CAGR by focusing resources on the defined target and implementing an integrated marketing and sales effort.

Liz Smith, Marketing Services


Liz Smith is a marketing specialist who comes from an engineering and manufacturing background.  Prior to transitioning from engineering into marketing, she spent several years in manufacturing engineering and management positions at Eaton Aerospace.

Liz earned a Master’s degree in Business Administration from Michigan State University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Weld Engineering from The Ohio State University.


Liz is a problem solver at heart, and is driven by metrics.  She attributes much of her success in manufacturing to the fact that everything is so easily measurable “it allows you to constantly adjust your tactics based on what is or isn’t working”.  At GrowthPoint, she takes this same approach to marketing.  She understands the importance of processes, measurement and continuous improvement for every marketing strategy.

During his 23+ year career at Penton, Wayne was known for his passion, creativity, and innovation in nurturing new ideas and opportunities for his team and his customers. He was pivotal in developing and/or nurturing new marketing ideas as they emerged, such as eNewsletters, lead nurturing, real-time lead delivery, webinars, eLearning, gated and paid web content, website memberships, sponsored eBooks, and many other custom digital marketing initiatives. Executing marketing that creates real results in something that Wayne thrives on, and as a former author himself, Wayne certainly understands the power of the right content in creating the right bridge between buyers and sellers. 

Prior to the media business, Wayne already had established a successful career in IT, serving in various leadership roles in the manufacturing, government, and reseller sector as well as writing hundreds of IT-related articles, three books, and speaking often at industry events and conferences all over the world.

Marketing Platform - LeadCentral\Lead Management












Lead Management


Customize. Respond. Streamline.

GrowthPoint’s lead management solutions help ensure proper and prompt lead follow up for higher closure rates, even in multi-channel environments.

"46% of marketers with mature lead management processes have sales teams that follow up on more than 75% of marketing-generated leads."Forrester Research

"Nurtured leads make 47% larger purchases than non-nurtured leads." The Annuitas Group


Marketing challenges
Marketing organizations often spend a majority of their budget on lead generation.  Yet many of those leads don’t receive prompt or proper follow up.  Some of the lead management challenges marketers face include:

poorly defined lead processes for managing and measuring leads
a variety of lead sources and formats leading to processing delays and lost opportunities
manual, time-consuming and error-prone lead handling processes
CRM systems that are not effective in a multi-channel environment
loss of visibility after hand-off to sales, especially in a channel environment
ineffective handling of leads by sales
poor visibility into campaign performance due to inadequate feedback from sales

 
5 steps to world-class lead management
Addressing the challenges of lead management requires a solid strategy and easy to use tools that support company objectives. GrowthPoint works with marketers to implement an effective lead management program by following a five-step process.






Strategy – World-class lead management starts with proper planning. GrowthPoint helps marketers define strategies to ensure that leads are effectively qualified, graded for quality and routed to the right hands for prompt and appropriate follow up.

Setup – GrowthPoint’s LeadCentral™ platform improves response time, especially in a complex channel environment, by automating lead management processes.  The system can handle any number of sources and formats, decreasing delays in lead entry and assignment.

Execution – Many GrowthPoint customers have been able to decrease the time it takes to assign leads from days to mere seconds.  When leads are assigned to the field, they are accompanied by a full history of the opportunity as well as links to sales tools to help close the business.

Reporting – Because the system is easy to use and does not require an on-premises implementation, channel partners and direct salespeople can easily update leads, improving marketing’s visibility into the prospect’s buying cycle and campaign performance.

Analysis – GrowthPoint helps marketing organizations by analyzing results and implementing course corrections for a continuous improvement in campaign and lead management performance.


Cost effective lead management for the channel
LeadCentral is a cost-effective web-based solution for managing leads even in a channel environment.  LeadCentral makes it easy for channel partners to use the system by allowing the addition of channel users without requiring user-licenses or software installation.   Since companies and their channel partners don’t need to use the same Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system in order to leverage LeadCentral, there is no need to replace existing systems.  LeadCentral also helps multi-channel organizations manage leads more effectively.  Employing proven marketing tools like prospect scoring and lead grading, leads are automatically assigned to sales with the proper sense of urgency.  In a multi-channel environment, this eliminates the need for a direct salesperson to manually share leads and collect feedback from channel partners.
GrowthPoint clients regularly receive feedback from sales on more than 85% of the leads!
LeadCentral™ the platform for effective lead management
GrowthPoint’s lead management programs are powered by LeadCentral, an integrated, cloud-based marketing platform that enables marketers to build, manage and measure an unlimited number of campaigns that execute automatically in response to prospect behavior and role.  The LeadCentral platform provides the ideal blend of measurability and flexibility for marketers to adapt programs to shifts in business strategy, while constantly improving results. 

LeadCentral integrates the flow of leads from initial lead identification (e.g. tradeshows, webinars or online campaigns), through qualification, scoring, grading and lead assignment.  This allows sales and marketing organizations to automate and improve lead handling processes, decreasing delays and errors for improved organizational performance. 

LeadCentral helps marketers and sales avoid database issues by keeping large and highly unqualified prospect databases separate from strategic sales opportunities, regardless of whether the organization uses LeadCentral OTS (Opportunity Tracking System) or a third party CRM application.

Marketing Platform - LeadCentral\Sales Tracking












Sales Tracking


Forecast. Manage. Close.

GrowthPoint Opportunity Tracking helps multichannel sales organizations track opportunities to drive cross company collaboration and improve forecasting and close rates.
"Companies that excel at lead nurturing generate 50% more sales ready leads at 33% lower cost." Forrester Research
Marketing challenges
Multichannel sales organizations selling technical products in a complex sales process face a number of challenges:

Capturing opportunity status from sales (internal or in the channel)
Aligning direct and channel sales efforts to the most important pursuits
Developing and tracking account plans across 3rd party opportunities
Collaborating with a channel and coordinating tasks required to close opportunities
Gaining the visibility needed to produce reliable forecasts that include 3rd party opportunities
Synchronizing information flow across disparate channel systems
Providing visibility to key sales pursuits while protecting the channel’s sensitive account and opportunity information
Rolling up forecasts from distributors, manufacturing reps, VARs and dealers across the entire organization

 
Herding cats
Anyone who has ever managed a 3rd party sales channel knows it’s not easy. Sharing information and coordinating activities can be a challenge. Third party sales organizations may need help closing opportunities, but they are often reluctant to share their entire account, contact and opportunity database. Instead, channel managers and their selling organizations often rely on email to update opportunity status, request assistance and supply information. 

Without a transparent and seamless way to record and track activities, sales cycles get delayed, tasks are left undone and opportunities missed. Furthermore, untold hours are spent each month, often by expensive selling resources, gathering and rolling up forecasts.

Despite problems caused by disparate systems, requiring a 3rd party selling organization to use a standardized Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or Sales Force Automation (SFA) system is usually not feasible.

These organizations often work with multiple companies and may follow a different sales methodology mapped to their existing system. The cost of an additional/new system may be prohibitive. Or they may simply not feel comfortable sharing all of their account information with any single vendor.

In order to gain the visibility needed to collaborate effectively and produce reliable sales forecasts, channel sales organizations need technology that captures opportunity information from 3rd party sources and synchronizes required actions – without requiring a lot of effort and expense on the part of the channel.


Complete visibility to opportunities
GrowthPoint Opportunity Tracking allows organizations to share information with 3rd party sales channels, supporting collaborative sales efforts to help close more orders and automatically roll up forecasts. The system is tailored to capture the specific information needed to track, manage and collaborate on sales pursuits.

Account Plans can also be developed and managed in the system with a proper workflow defined to ensure the teamwork required to achieve the plan. Tasks can be assigned across internal as well as 3rd party resources, with email alerts notifying those responsible for completion. Regular reports help sales teams and account managers ensure smooth progress from account planning to opportunity creation to close.



Benefits of GrowthPoint Opportunity Tracking

One low monthly infrastructure investment with no “per seat” cost
Does not require the channel to purchase and learn a new CRM or SFA system
Web-based for easy access, including via mobile devices
Most opportunities can be entered/updated in seconds
Tailored to support the organization’s business and sales structure
Most channel organizations can be set up and running in less than thirty days

Opportunity Tracking – powered by LeadCentral™
LeadCentral, GrowthPoint’s integrated, cloud-based marketing platform helps channel sales organizations manage opportunities from creation to close. Adding Opportunity Tracking to LeadCentral is a powerful, cost-effective tool that allows channel sales to enter or update opportunities quickly and easily.
