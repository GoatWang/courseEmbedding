Gold exchange-traded product

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Gold exchange-traded products are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds (CEFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that aim to track the price of gold. Gold exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including Zurich, Mumbai, London, Paris and New York. As of 25 June 2010[update], physically backed funds held 2,062.6 tonnes of vaulted gold in total for private and institutional investors.[1] Each gold ETF, ETN, and CEF has a different structure outlined in its prospectus. Some such instruments do not necessarily hold physical gold. For example, gold ETNs generally track the price of gold using derivatives.

History[edit]
The first gold exchange-traded product was Central Fund of Canada, a closed-end fund founded in 1961. It later amended its articles of incorporation in 1983 to provide investors with an exchange-tradable product for ownership of gold and silver bullion. It has been listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange since 1966 and the AMEX since 1986.[2]
The idea of a gold exchange-traded fund was first conceptualized by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India when they filed a proposal with the SEBI in May 2002. However it did not receive regulatory approval at first and was only launched later in March 2007.[3] The first gold ETF actually launched was Gold Bullion Securities, which listed 28 March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange. Graham Tuckwell, the founder and major shareholder of ETF Securities, was behind the launch of this fund and enlisted N.M. Rothschild & Sons (Australia) Ltd, Citibank and Deutsche Bank as market makers on the ASX.[4]
Fees[edit]
Typically a commission of 0.4% is charged for trading in gold ETFs and an annual storage fee is charged. U.S. based transactions are a notable exception, where most brokers charge only a small fraction of this commission rate. The annual expenses of the fund such as storage, insurance, and management fees are charged by selling a small amount of gold represented by each share, so the amount of gold in each share will gradually decline over time. All gold ETFs in the United States have an annual expense ratio between .25% and .4%.[citation needed] In some countries, gold ETFs represent a way to avoid the sales tax or the VAT which would apply to physical gold coins and bars.
In the United States, sales of a gold ETF are treated as sales of the underlying commodity and thus are taxed at the 28% capital gains rate for collectibles, rather than the rates applied to equity securities.[5]

	iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (IAU): A Quick Guide to IAU
The IAU ETF is an effective, inexpensive way to get gold exposure

When it comes to gold exchange-traded funds, the gold standard — no pun intended — is the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD). At the very least, GLD is the largest and most heavily traded gold ETF as well as being the preferred gold ETF for many professional traders. It also set the stage for rival iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSEARCA:IAU), debuting in late 2004, and IAU quickly found its own success.

With more than $8 billion in assets under management, IAU is big, though still not close to GLD’s $35 billion. Still, iShares’ product is one of the largest gold ETFs on the market — and for that matter, also one of the largest commodity funds of any variety.
To be technical, IAU is not actually an ETF, as iShares points out. It is structured as a trust that holds physical gold, though it more or less acts just like an ETF does.
“The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act,” says iShares. “Shares of the Trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds.”
IAU Offers Gold Exposure at a Discount
GLD charges 0.4% per year, or $40 on a $10,000 stake. That is not bad among commodity funds, but it’s high enough to make IAU’s annual fee of 0.25% notable. For investors looking for long-term gold exposure, saving $15 per year can and will add up over time.
The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet
The iShares Gold Trust is designed to give investors exposure to day-to-day price movements in gold, one of the most heavily traded commodities in the world. In addition to its low fee, IAU has also been a hit with retail investors due to its low share price. Because GLD represents a tenth of an ounce of gold, whereas IAU shares represent a hundredth, the former tends to trade at triple digits while the latter trades at double digits.
In either case, investors should be aware that selling a product such as GLD or IAU does not result in ownership of gold bars. No one from iShares will come to your door delivering gold after you sell the investment.
Gold also does not offer investors yield or interest, so this is not the investment for the income-seeking crowd. However, a small allocation to a product like IAU can help a portfolio endure rising inflation and profit from a weaker U.S. dollar.
Gold, like all commodities, is denominated in dollars. The weaker the dollar, the better gold (and IAU) usually perform.
As of this writing, Todd Shriber was long IAU.

1. Exposure to the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
The iShares Gold Trust (the 'Trust') seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of gold.

The iShares Gold Trust is not a standard ETF. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. Shares of the Trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other information included in the prospectus.

Important Information

 

This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Investors should read it carefully before investing.


iShares Gold Trust (the "Trust") has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting www.iShares.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-800-474-2737

Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Because shares of the Trust are intended to reflect the price of the gold held by the Trust, the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting gold prices. Additionally, shares of the Trust are bought and sold at market price, not at net asset value ("NAV"). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

Shares of the Trust are intended to reflect, at any given time, the market price of gold owned by the Trust at that time less the Trust's expenses and liabilities. The price received upon the sale of the shares, which trade at market price, may be more or less than the value of the gold represented by such shares. If an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists, such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares. For a more complete discussion of the risk factors relative to the Trust, carefully read the prospectus.

Following an investment in shares of the Trust, several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of gold and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares. Among them: (i) Large sales by the official sector. A significant portion of the aggregate world gold holdings is owned by governments, central banks and related institutions. If one or more of these institutions decides to sell in amounts large enough to cause a decline in world gold prices, the price of the shares will be adversely affected. (ii) A significant increase in gold hedging activity by gold producers. Should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of gold producing companies, it could cause a decline in world gold prices, adversely affecting the price of the shares. (iii) A significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards gold. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards gold, it could cause a decline in world gold prices, negatively impacting the price of the shares.

Gold Spot Prices provided by The Bullion Desk. No warranty is given for the accuracy of these prices and no liability is accepted for reliance thereon. Prices are provided on a reasonable efforts basis and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet. Prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades.

The amount of gold represented by shares of the Trust will decrease over the life of the Trust due to sales of gold necessary to pay the sponsor's fee and trust expenses. Without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the shares will also decline, and investors will lose money on their investment. The Trust will have limited duration. The liquidation of the Trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the Trust's gold will result in losses to investors. Although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the NAV and the trading price of Trust shares through arbitrage opportunities, there is no guarantee that they will do so. There is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares, which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares. The value of the shares of the Trust will be adversely affected if gold owned by the Trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the Trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle. This means that the value of your shares may be adversely affected by Trust losses that, if the Trust had been actively managed, might have been avoidable.

Shares of the Trust are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by BlackRock, Inc., and its affiliates, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. The sponsor of the trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”). BlackRock Investments, LLC ("BRIL"), assists in the promotion of the Trust. The Sponsor and BRIL are affiliates of BlackRock, Inc. Although shares of the iShares Gold Trust may be bought or sold on the secondary market through any brokerage account, shares of the Trust are not redeemable from the Trust except in large aggregated units called "Baskets". Only registered broker-dealers that become authorized participants by entering into a contract with the sponsor and the trustee of the Trust may purchase or redeem Baskets.

Net Asset Value (NAV) is determined as specified in the prospectus: the Trustee values the trust's gold on the basis of the LBMA Gold Price PM.

All references to LBMA Gold Price are used with the permission of ICE Benchmark Administration Limited and have been provided for informational purposes only. ICE Benchmark Administration Limited accepts no liability or responsibility for the accuracy of the prices or the underlying product to which the prices may be referenced.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The Trust’s secondary objective is for the shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold less the expenses of the Trust’s operations.
 














 

Key Points

DeliverabilityVanEck Merk Gold Trust holds gold bullion in the form of allocated London Bars. It differentiates itself by providing investors with the option to take physical delivery of gold bullion in exchange for their shares. ConvertibilityFor the purpose of facilitating delivery, Merk has developed a proprietary process for the conversion of London Bars into gold coins and bars in denominations investors may desire. Tax EfficiencyTaking delivery of gold is not a taxable event as investors merely take possession of what they already own: the gold.

 How To Properly Invest In An Gold ETF? What Are The Benefits | ETF Investor's Guide            ETF Investor’s Guide Menu       How To Properly Invest In An Gold ETF? What Are The Benefits Gold ETF: Benefits and Investment AdviceFor investors, Gold remains one of the hottest commodities to own due to its “safe investment” tag. Because Gold is a staple of global economy, it is regarded as a low risk-high return asset in times of duress. However, investment in Gold does not mean stacking up piles of Gold bars in your house.    How Gold ETF Works?Nowadays, the simplest form of investment in Gold is ETF, exchange traded funds. Without owning a physical Gold asset, investors can simply invest in Gold ETF allowing them to profit from the positive movement of Gold price. There are many types of Gold ETF that may attract potential investors. As such, Gold ETF can also take the form of derivative contract, futures or gold-related index. There are also gold ETF that derive their prices from the Gold assets held in a trust. Similarly, there are specific gold ETF that track companies in the gold industry. As an example of a Gold ETF, consider investing in GLD, the SPDR Gold Share ETF. The SPDR Gold Share ETF is perhaps one of the most popular ETFs, which closely mimics the performance of the Gold prices allowing investors to reap the benefits of owning Gold without buying Gold bars and related assets. Why Buy Gold ETF?One of the main advantages of buying an ETF Gold is the exposure and simplicity of the asset class. For instance, if investors wanted to buy shares of Gold mining companies, owning a Gold ETF tailored towards such mining companies will offer full exposure to the Gold assets. In addition, investors do not have to worry about the excessive commissions and micro-economic impact on the shares of each individual gold mining company. Besides, there are tax advantages of the ETF because tax on profits are deferred until the sale of the ETF. Considering that Gold ETF do not have large commissions, tax on the final sale of the ETF is a very minor price to pay compared to the tax on other popular investment vehicles such as stocks, mutual funds and hedge funds etc.   Strategies for Trading GoldGold is one of the safest investments, therefore it is logical to use Gold ETF in a portfolio because it acts as an automatic hedge to the price of US Dollar. As the price of US Dollar decrease, Gold price is likely to increase. In fact, rise in US Dollar does not affect Gold prices because Gold is a universal benchmark that is not correlated with wild swings in the Forex economy. Selling Gold ETF can also be used to protect against the Gold Price if investors have major investments in a country that has Gold as a major source of income. Actually, Gold ETF options can also act as one of the safest investment strategies to balance any investment portfolio.
