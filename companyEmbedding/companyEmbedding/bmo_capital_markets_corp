History[edit]
1912 – Nesbitt Thomson[edit]
A.J. Nesbitt of Montreal and P.A. Thomson of Hamilton, Ontario establish Nesbitt Thomson, a firm that becomes a household name in Canada for its role in some of the world’s largest mining, resources, and hydroelectric power projects.
After World War II, Nesbitt Thomson expands its operations to include such diverse industry sectors as chemicals, salt, steel, ships, farm machinery, retail stores, and a transcontinental natural gas pipeline.
1976 – Burns Fry[edit]
Burns Fry is created from the merger of Burns Bros. and Denton, known for equity trading and underwriting capabilities, and Fry Mills Spence, known for strong debt trading and underwriting. These Toronto firms had been highly successful in the securities business since 1932 and 1925 respectively. The merger brings together a large capital base and a strong branch-office system.
1987 – Nesbitt Thomson acquired[edit]
Bank of Montreal acquires Nesbitt Thomson in the first of many broker/bank mergers in the Canadian financial services sector.
1994 – Nesbitt Burns formed[edit]
Nesbitt Thomson and Burns Fry merge to form Nesbitt Burns, which becomes one of the leading investment firms in the marketplace.
1999 – Harris Nesbitt[edit]
The merger of the corporate banking arm of Harris Bank, BMO Financial Group’s Chicago-based subsidiary, and the U.S. investment banking capabilities of Nesbitt Burns, creates Harris Nesbitt. The new firm focuses on the middle market of the U.S. Midwest.
2000 – BMO Nesbitt Burns[edit]
The “BMO” brand is added to the Nesbitt Burns name in order to link the firm’s corporate identity with BMO Financial Group.
2003 – Gerard Klauer Mattison[edit]
BMO Financial Group acquires Gerard Klauer Mattison (GKM), providing Harris Nesbitt with a U.S.-based equity research and institutional sales and trading platform. GKM was founded in 1989 in New York as a boutique equity research and investment banking firm serving the institutional marketplace.
2006 – BMO Capital Markets name adopted[edit]
BMO Capital Markets was launched in June 2006 when BMO Financial Group’s Canadian, U.S. and international wholesale banking capabilities were merged.[2]
2016 – Greene Holcomb Fisher[edit]
In June 2016, BMO Financial Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the business of Greene Holcomb Fisher ("GHF"), a boutique M&A advisory firm based in Minneapolis. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in BMO Financial Group's fiscal 4th quarter.

History[edit]
1912 – Nesbitt Thomson[edit]
A.J. Nesbitt of Montreal and P.A. Thomson of Hamilton, Ontario establish Nesbitt Thomson, a firm that becomes a household name in Canada for its role in some of the world’s largest mining, resources, and hydroelectric power projects.
After World War II, Nesbitt Thomson expands its operations to include such diverse industry sectors as chemicals, salt, steel, ships, farm machinery, retail stores, and a transcontinental natural gas pipeline.
1976 – Burns Fry[edit]
Burns Fry is created from the merger of Burns Bros. and Denton, known for equity trading and underwriting capabilities, and Fry Mills Spence, known for strong debt trading and underwriting. These Toronto firms had been highly successful in the securities business since 1932 and 1925 respectively. The merger brings together a large capital base and a strong branch-office system.
1987 – Nesbitt Thomson acquired[edit]
Bank of Montreal acquires Nesbitt Thomson in the first of many broker/bank mergers in the Canadian financial services sector.
1994 – Nesbitt Burns formed[edit]
Nesbitt Thomson and Burns Fry merge to form Nesbitt Burns, which becomes one of the leading investment firms in the marketplace.
1999 – Harris Nesbitt[edit]
The merger of the corporate banking arm of Harris Bank, BMO Financial Group’s Chicago-based subsidiary, and the U.S. investment banking capabilities of Nesbitt Burns, creates Harris Nesbitt. The new firm focuses on the middle market of the U.S. Midwest.
2000 – BMO Nesbitt Burns[edit]
The “BMO” brand is added to the Nesbitt Burns name in order to link the firm’s corporate identity with BMO Financial Group.
2003 – Gerard Klauer Mattison[edit]
BMO Financial Group acquires Gerard Klauer Mattison (GKM), providing Harris Nesbitt with a U.S.-based equity research and institutional sales and trading platform. GKM was founded in 1989 in New York as a boutique equity research and investment banking firm serving the institutional marketplace.
2006 – BMO Capital Markets name adopted[edit]
BMO Capital Markets was launched in June 2006 when BMO Financial Group’s Canadian, U.S. and international wholesale banking capabilities were merged.[2]
2016 – Greene Holcomb Fisher[edit]
In June 2016, BMO Financial Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the business of Greene Holcomb Fisher ("GHF"), a boutique M&A advisory firm based in Minneapolis. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in BMO Financial Group's fiscal 4th quarter.

BMO Capital Markets Introduces Environmental, Social & Governance-Linked Principal Protected Deposit Notes



TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Nov. 10, 2016) - BMO Capital Markets, the investment and corporate banking arm of BMO Financial Group (TSX:BMO)(NYSE:BMO), has launched Canada's first principal protected notes linked to an environmental, social and governance-themed index. 
        
The BMO Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) index is a proprietary, quantitative and socially screened index that seeks to provide exposure to select components of the Jantzi Social Index (JSI), a stock index of Canadian companies that comply with a set of broad ESG screening criteria.
        
"The new product offers our clients a socially responsible investment while providing protection of their principal at maturity," said Jerome Cloutier, Managing Director, Global Structured Products, of the two series of notes launched on Oct. 31.
        
A proprietary, quantitative rules-based screen is used to select the BMO ESG Index components from the JSI. At maturity, investors in BMO Environmental, Social & Governance Index Linked Principal Protected Deposit Notes will receive the amount of their original deposit plus a variable amount that reflects the price return on the equities in the BMO ESG Index over the term of the note.

History[edit]
1912 – Nesbitt Thomson[edit]
A.J. Nesbitt of Montreal and P.A. Thomson of Hamilton, Ontario establish Nesbitt Thomson, a firm that becomes a household name in Canada for its role in some of the world’s largest mining, resources, and hydroelectric power projects.
After World War II, Nesbitt Thomson expands its operations to include such diverse industry sectors as chemicals, salt, steel, ships, farm machinery, retail stores, and a transcontinental natural gas pipeline.
1976 – Burns Fry[edit]
Burns Fry is created from the merger of Burns Bros. and Denton, known for equity trading and underwriting capabilities, and Fry Mills Spence, known for strong debt trading and underwriting. These Toronto firms had been highly successful in the securities business since 1932 and 1925 respectively. The merger brings together a large capital base and a strong branch-office system.
1987 – Nesbitt Thomson acquired[edit]
Bank of Montreal acquires Nesbitt Thomson in the first of many broker/bank mergers in the Canadian financial services sector.
1994 – Nesbitt Burns formed[edit]
Nesbitt Thomson and Burns Fry merge to form Nesbitt Burns, which becomes one of the leading investment firms in the marketplace.
1999 – Harris Nesbitt[edit]
The merger of the corporate banking arm of Harris Bank, BMO Financial Group’s Chicago-based subsidiary, and the U.S. investment banking capabilities of Nesbitt Burns, creates Harris Nesbitt. The new firm focuses on the middle market of the U.S. Midwest.
2000 – BMO Nesbitt Burns[edit]
The “BMO” brand is added to the Nesbitt Burns name in order to link the firm’s corporate identity with BMO Financial Group.
2003 – Gerard Klauer Mattison[edit]
BMO Financial Group acquires Gerard Klauer Mattison (GKM), providing Harris Nesbitt with a U.S.-based equity research and institutional sales and trading platform. GKM was founded in 1989 in New York as a boutique equity research and investment banking firm serving the institutional marketplace.
2006 – BMO Capital Markets name adopted[edit]
BMO Capital Markets was launched in June 2006 when BMO Financial Group’s Canadian, U.S. and international wholesale banking capabilities were merged.[2]
2016 – Greene Holcomb Fisher[edit]
In June 2016, BMO Financial Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the business of Greene Holcomb Fisher ("GHF"), a boutique M&A advisory firm based in Minneapolis. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in BMO Financial Group's fiscal 4th quarter.

History[edit]
1912 – Nesbitt Thomson[edit]
A.J. Nesbitt of Montreal and P.A. Thomson of Hamilton, Ontario establish Nesbitt Thomson, a firm that becomes a household name in Canada for its role in some of the world’s largest mining, resources, and hydroelectric power projects.
After World War II, Nesbitt Thomson expands its operations to include such diverse industry sectors as chemicals, salt, steel, ships, farm machinery, retail stores, and a transcontinental natural gas pipeline.
1976 – Burns Fry[edit]
Burns Fry is created from the merger of Burns Bros. and Denton, known for equity trading and underwriting capabilities, and Fry Mills Spence, known for strong debt trading and underwriting. These Toronto firms had been highly successful in the securities business since 1932 and 1925 respectively. The merger brings together a large capital base and a strong branch-office system.
1987 – Nesbitt Thomson acquired[edit]
Bank of Montreal acquires Nesbitt Thomson in the first of many broker/bank mergers in the Canadian financial services sector.
1994 – Nesbitt Burns formed[edit]
Nesbitt Thomson and Burns Fry merge to form Nesbitt Burns, which becomes one of the leading investment firms in the marketplace.
1999 – Harris Nesbitt[edit]
The merger of the corporate banking arm of Harris Bank, BMO Financial Group’s Chicago-based subsidiary, and the U.S. investment banking capabilities of Nesbitt Burns, creates Harris Nesbitt. The new firm focuses on the middle market of the U.S. Midwest.
2000 – BMO Nesbitt Burns[edit]
The “BMO” brand is added to the Nesbitt Burns name in order to link the firm’s corporate identity with BMO Financial Group.
2003 – Gerard Klauer Mattison[edit]
BMO Financial Group acquires Gerard Klauer Mattison (GKM), providing Harris Nesbitt with a U.S.-based equity research and institutional sales and trading platform. GKM was founded in 1989 in New York as a boutique equity research and investment banking firm serving the institutional marketplace.
2006 – BMO Capital Markets name adopted[edit]
BMO Capital Markets was launched in June 2006 when BMO Financial Group’s Canadian, U.S. and international wholesale banking capabilities were merged.[2]
2016 – Greene Holcomb Fisher[edit]
In June 2016, BMO Financial Group entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the business of Greene Holcomb Fisher ("GHF"), a boutique M&A advisory firm based in Minneapolis. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in BMO Financial Group's fiscal 4th quarter.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
