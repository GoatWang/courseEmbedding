Gabelli Securities International Ltd. Acquires Horizon Research 
      Advisors, a New Delhi Investment Boutique




      ‘Acquisition increases GSIL’s emerging market assets under advisory, 
      expanding its presence in one of the world’s fastest growing democracies’
    





January 07, 2013 01:11 PM Eastern Standard Time



LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gabelli Securities International (UK) Ltd., (‘GSIL’), a global 
      alternative asset management platform and merchant advisor, announced 
      today that it had acquired New Delhi-based Horizon Research Advisors 
      (‘Horizon’), expanding its assets and client access to the Indian 
      sub-continent and South East Asian marketplace.
    


      “The acquisition of Horizon’s business is of strategic value to GSIL as 
      we further leverage our expertise and infrastructure in event-driven 
      value investing in emerging markets,” Marc Gabelli, Co-Chief Executive 
      Officer of GSIL UK said.
    

      “The acquisition includes the management of several advisory efforts, 
      most notably Horizon’s special situation coverage, a universe that spans 
      more than $1 billion of investment opportunities. There are 
      approximately 4,000 actively traded companies in India, offering a 
      sizeable group of businesses for superior diversification and returns to 
      client portfolios. India has a deeply rooted equity culture dating back 
      to the period of British rule. The Bombay Stock exchange (BSE), founded 
      in 1875, is Asia’s oldest public bourse. There are excellent 
      opportunities in the region to enhance returns,” Mr. Gabelli added.
    

      Manjit Kalha, Managing Partner and Co-Head of Horizon, will continue 
      overseeing the management of the Horizon research platform with Mr. 
      Gabelli. He noted that: “Horizon has broadened its footprint in 
      event-driven, value investment products and we plan to further expand 
      our product offering in the coming year.”
    

      Mr. Kalha added that: “The India and South East Asia equity market has 
      certain attributes that lead us to believe there are opportunities to 
      earn risk-adjusted returns through superior stock selection using our 
      process. We believe it is possible to identify pockets of value/price 
      misalignment, especially within domestic demand-led industries. With 
      secular trends led by increasing GDP, growing population and increasing 
      disposable income among other long-term trends, there are ample 
      opportunities to invest in companies that will benefit.”
    

      Evan Miller, GSIL UK’s CEO, said: “With this transaction, GSIL UK’s 
      global funds will add India-based profitability and risk management to 
      its portfolio capabilities. Horizon’s broad range of capabilities 
      targets investment opportunities and deepens our universe that includes 
      distressed, restructured and general value-based products.”

Monday–Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (CST)






Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by clicking here or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser. 
Read additional important information.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
Each of the mutual funds or services referred to in the U.S. Global Investors, Inc. website may be offered only to persons in the United States. This website should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment product or service to investors residing outside the United States.
Certain materials on the site may contain dated information. The information provided was current at the time of publication. For current information regarding any of the funds mentioned in such materials, please visit the fund performance page.

“Mother of All Bubbles” Keeps Gold in Focus
July 24, 2017

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about last week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.

As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro last week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.









“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note last week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Like gold in India, exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.

click to enlarge
Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.

click to enlarge
It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentioned in a note last week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

How to Get a Better Bargain on Your Investment with Emerging Europe
July 20, 2017

American equities have been a good place to invest during the current bull market, now in its eighth year. Since the November election, the S&P 500 Index has surged close to 16 percent. But this means that valuations continue to creep up, and political risk threatens to derail further gains as President Donald Trump’s high-growth agenda stumbles on even more roadblocks.
Investors might therefore be looking for an alternative. I believe one of the most attractive destinations for your investment dollars right now is emerging European countries. Below you can see a valuation comparison between U.S. and emerging European equities. Trading at 9.2 times earnings, the latter are offering quite a bargain for investors seeking a “better bang for the buck.”

click to enlarge
More than that, though, “core” Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries—including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary—are currently among the fastest growing in the world. In a recent series on the region, the Financial Times put it succinctly: “The former communist countries that have joined the European Union (EU) since 2004 offer superior growth to western Europe and many other emerging markets, combined with the benefits and protections of EU membership.”
Expectations for economic growth in CEE countries have changed rapidly and positively. The consensus forecast is now 2.5 percent growth this year, 0.3 percent points higher than expectations near the beginning of the year.
Next year could be even brighter, with analysts expecting 2.6 percent growth, 0.1 percentage point higher than earlier forecasts. Stronger-than-expected external demand in Western Europe, a tighter labor market, an attractive environment for foreign investment, government stimulus measures, easy financing conditions and the revival of EU structural funds are all supporting stronger growth in the region.
Manufacturing Continues to Strengthen
Loyal readers of Frank Talk know that we closely follow the purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which measures the strength of a country’s manufacturing industry. We’ve found it to be not only a handy gauge of future commodities demand but also a country’s or region’s economic growth potential.  
For the first time in recent memory, most emerging European economies’ PMIs are above the key 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Greece rose from 49.6 in May to 50.5 in June, the first time its manufacturing sector was in expansion mode in nearly a year.

click to enlarge
Russia grew at a much slower pace in June, however, with its PMI falling to 50.3, just above the threshold. But as I shared with you this week, Capital Economics analysts believe Russian growth in the coming quarters “will be stronger than most anticipate,” with the Central Bank of Russia loosening monetary policy even further.
The fact that all CEE countries are above 50 points to synchronized growth. It also suggests that the worst of the region’s economic woes following the global recession might finally be in the rearview mirror.
Poland the Next “Economic Powerhouse”?
Writing recently for the New York Times’ opinions section, Ruchier Sharma, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist, singled out Poland as the world’s likeliest next advanced economy, following South Korea’s entry into the high-income club 20 years ago.
I have to agree. As Sharma points out, Poland has seen average annual growth of 4 percent since 1991, the year it transitioned from communism to democracy. During that period, it hasn’t had a single down year, amazingly enough.
The Polish economy continued to grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the second quarter, as suggested by the May retail sales and industrial output data. According to mBank analysts, fiscal-year growth will slightly exceed 4 percent, driven by public investments recovery and persistently strong consumption. The real retail sales growth in the second quarter held close to the prior-quarter level, which means that consumption growth should remain at around 5 percent, mBank estimates.
Poland’s impressive ascent should only help strengthen other CEE countries, both economically and politically. Its president, Andrzej Duda, seems fully aware of this and has taken several important strides to improve not just Poland’s economy but the region’s as well. The Three Seas Initiative, spearheaded last year by Duda and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi?, seeks to connect the economies and infrastructure of 12 CEE countries between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas. A number of EU officials see the Initiative as a threat to the EU bloc’s unity, which might be partially why President Trump agreed to meet with Initiative members when he visited Poland last month.

Stocks on the Rise
Also contributing to CEE growth right now is the steadily weakening U.S. dollar, as Reuters reports. Prague stocks rose to a seven-week high this week, while Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange Index (BUX) continues to hit new all-time highs.

click to enlarge
Speaking of Hungary, its government is considering whether to lower personal income taxes to 10 percent from the current 15 percent. This would be a major boost to Hungarians’ disposable income, which is already rising at a breathtaking pace. Wage growth in April was an amazing 14.6 percent.
Again, the CEE region looks more and more like a good place to invest, not least of which because of its attractive discount to American equities.

Russia Collusion Story: A Big “Nothing Burger” or a Case for Gold?
July 17, 2017

Gold got a boost Friday on weaker-than-expected inflation and retail sales figures, casting doubt on the Federal Reserve’s ability to continue normalizing interest rates this year.
Consumer prices rose slightly in June, at their slowest pace so far this year. The consumer price index (CPI), released on Friday, showed the cost of living in America rising only 1.6 percent compared to the same month last year, significantly down from the most recent high of 2.8 percent in February and below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. Much of the decline was due to energy prices, which fell 1.6 percent from May.

click to enlarge
As I’ve explained elsewhere, CPI is an important economic indicator for gold investors to track. The yellow metal has historically responded positively when inflation rises—and especially when it pushes the yield on a government bond into negative territory. Why lock your money up in a 2-year or 5-year Treasury that’s guaranteed to give you a negative yield?









But right now the gold Fear Trade is being supported by what some are calling turmoil in the Trump administration. Last week the Russia collusion story took a new twist, with emails surfacing showing that Donald Trump Jr.; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and now-senior advisor; and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort all agreed to meet with a Russian lawyer last summer under the pretext that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Whether or not this meeting is “collusion” is not for me to say, but the optics of it certainly look bad, and it threatens to undermine the president’s agenda even more. For the first time last week, an article of impeachment was formally introduced on the House floor that accuses Trump of obstructing justice. The article is unlikely to go very far in the Republican-controlled House, but it adds further uncertainty to Trump’s ability to achieve some of his goals, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. I’ll have more to say on this later
A Contrarian View of China
A new report from CLSA shows that Asian markets and Europe were the top performers during the first six months of the year. Korea took the top spot, surging more than 25 percent, followed closely by China.

click to enlarge
Despite persistent negative “news” about China in the mainstream media, conditions in the world’s second-largest economy are improving. Consumption is up and household income remains strong. The number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in China—those with at least 10 million renminbi ($1.5 million) in investable income—rose to 1.6 million last year, about nine times the number only 10 years ago. It’s estimated we could see as many as 1.87 million Chinese HNWIs by the end of 2017.
According to CLSA, global trade is robust, with emerging markets, and particularly China, driving most of the acceleration this year. In the first three months of 2017, global trade grew 4 percent compared to the same period last year, its fastest pace since 2011.
“Indeed the early months of 2017 have seen China become easily the biggest single country driver of Asian trade growth,” writes Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA.
A lot of this growth can be attributed to Beijing’s monumental One Belt, One Road infrastructure project, which I’ve highlighted many times before. But according to Alexious Lee, CLSA’s head of China industrial research, a “more nationalist America” in the first six months of the year has likely given China more leverage to assume “a larger global, and especially regional, leadership role.”
This comports with what I said back in January, in a Frank Talk titled “China Sets the Stage to Replace the U.S. as Global Trade Leader.” With President Donald Trump having already withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and promising to renegotiate or tear up other trade agreements—he recently tweeted that the U.S. has “made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history”—China has emerged, amazingly, as a champion of free trade, a position of power it will likely continue to capitalize on.
The country’s overseas construction orders have continued to expand, with agreements signed since 2013 valued at more than $600 billion.

Emerging Europe Expected to Remain Strong
Another recent report, this one from Capital Economics, shows that the investment case for emerging Europe remains strong in 2017. Russia is expected to strengthen over the next 12 months, while Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are likely to remain attractive.
“Russia’s economy has pulled out of recession and growth in the coming quarters will be stronger than most anticipate,” the research firm writes, adding that its central bank’s loosening of monetary policy should support the recovery even further.
To be sure, the region faces strong headwinds, including a rapidly aging population and the loss of an estimated 20 million skilled workers to foreign markets over the past 25 years, according to a July 11 presentation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But I believe that as conditions in central emerging Europe countries continue to improve, many of those workers will be returning home. Life in the region is not the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago, when good jobs might have been scarce. Firms are now growing at a healthy rate and hiring more workers. As you can see below, unemployment rates in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been falling steadily since at least 2012 and are now lower than the broader European Union.    

click to enlarge
This strength is reflected in emerging Europe’s capital markets. For the 12-month period as of July 12, Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange is up 38 percent. Poland’s WIG20 is up more than 43 percent. Meanwhile, the STOXX Europe 600 Index—which includes some of the largest Western European companies—has made gains of only 17 percent over the same period.

Markets Still Believe in Trump
As we all know, the mainstream media’s criticism and ire aren’t reserved for China alone. Ninety-nine percent of the media right now is against President Trump, for a number of reasons—some of them deserved, some of them not.
Markets, however, seem not to care what the media or polls have to say. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to hit new all-time highs. Even though it’s stalled a few times, the “Trump rally” appears to be in full-speed-ahead mode, more than eight months after the election.
Back in November, I wrote about one of my favorite books, James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds, which argues that large groups of people will nearly always be smarter and better at making predictions than an “elite” few. Surowiecki’s ideas were vindicated last year when investors accurately predicted Trump’s election, with markets turning negative between July 31 and October 31.
For the same reason, I think it’s important we pay close attention to what markets are forecasting today.
The White House is under siege on multiple fronts, which, as I said, has been positive for gold’s Fear Trade. But equity investors also seem to like the direction Trump is taking, whether it’s pushing for tax reform and deregulation or shaking up the “beltway party,” composed of deeply entrenched D.C. lobbyists and career bureaucrats. Just last week, the president made waves for firing a number of bureaucrats at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), long plagued by scandal and controversy. Since he took office in January, Trump has told more than 500 VA workers “You’re fired!”   
The Fundamentals of “Quantamental”
Of course, we look at so much more than government policy when making investment decisions. We take a blended approach of not only assessing fundamentals such as market share and returns on capital but also conducting quantitative analysis.
It’s this combination that some in the industry are calling “quantamental” investing. At first glance, “quantamental” might sound like nothing more than cute wordplay—not unlike “labsky,” “bullmation” and other clever names we give mixed-breed dogs—but it’s rapidly replacing traditional investment strategies at the institutional level.
Business Insider puts it in simple terms: “Quantamental managers combine the bottom-up stock-picking skills of fundamental investors with the use of computing power and big-data sets to test their hypotheses.”
See my Vancouver Investment Conference presentation, “What’s Driving Gold: The Invasion of the Quants,” to learn more about how we use quantitative analysis, machine learning and data mining.
Wall Street: The Birthplace of American Capitalism and Government

The concept of quantamentals helps explain our entry into smart-factor ETFs. As most of you already know, members of my team and I visited the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) three weeks ago to mark the launch of our latest ETF.
While there, Doug Yones, head of exchange-traded products at the NYSE, gave us a short history lesson about the exchange and surrounding area.
Most investors are aware that the NYSE, which is celebrating its 225th anniversary this year, is the epicenter of capitalism—not just in the U.S. but also globally.

What many people might not realize is that on the site where the exchange now stands, Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. treasury secretary, floated bonds to replace the debt the nascent country had incurred during the Revolutionary War.
Right next door to the NYSE is Federal Hall, where George Washington took his first oath of office in April 1789. The building today serves as a museum and memorial to the first U.S. president, whose statue now looks out over Wall Street and its passersby.
In this one single block of Wall Street, therefore, American capitalism and government were born. Here you can find the essential DNA of the American experiment, which, over the many years, has fostered our entrepreneurial spirit to form capital and to create new businesses and jobs. Growth, innovation and competition run through our veins, and that’s largely because of the events that unfolded centuries ago at the NYSE and Federal Hall.

Commodities Halftime Report: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
July 10, 2017

Of the 14 commodities we track closely at U.S. Global Investors, wheat rose to take the top spot for the first half of 2017, returning more than 25 percent. The grain was followed closely by palladium—used primarily in the production of catalytic converters—which gained 24 percent.

click to enlarge
To view our ever-popular, interactive Periodic Table of Commodity Returns, click here.
Between the start of the year and June 30, the Bloomberg Commodity Index contracted 4.03 percent, with energy weighing down on the mostly strong performances of precious and industrial metals and agriculturals.
Contributing to metals’ gains was U.S. dollar weakness. During the first six months, the greenback lost 7.54 percent, responding partially to President Donald Trump’s comment in April that the dollar was “getting too strong.”
More recently, the president tweeted his thoughts on gas prices, which he pointed out were “the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years” for the July Fourth holiday. “I would like to see them go even lower,” he added.
Trump Goes to Warsaw
Speaking of Trump, I feel as if he has represented the U.S. and its values admirably during his visit to Europe last week. His speech in Warsaw sought to strengthen ties between America and Poland, which the New York Times just named the “next economic powerhouse.”

Trump drew attention to a danger that’s “invisible” yet every bit as dangerous as terrorism and extremism—namely, “the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.”
The U.S. and Poland “became great not because of paperwork and regulations,” the president said, “but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.”
This is the Trump I believe voters elected last November. If he were only able to stay on message and give his Twitter account a rest, he might more easily help engender and inspire an environment that better reflects the vision he described to his Polish audience.
I’m also encouraged by his first one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. From what I’ve read, it sounds as if the two leaders managed to make some progress on Syria, with both sides agreeing to cooperate in maintaining “safe zones.”
Oil Embroiled
Regarding lower gas prices, Trump just might get his wish. Having fallen 14.30 percent in the first six months, oil is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years.

click to enlarge
Much of the thanks for oil’s slump goes to U.S. shale producers, which were quick to reactivate dormant rigs following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) December announcement that it would be cutting production. As a result, the market is awash in black gold. In May, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that domestic output should average 9.3 million barrels a day this year and nearly 10 million in 2018, a level unseen in the U.S. since 1970.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) popped above $47 a barrel last week, however, on news that oil and gas inventories in the U.S. dropped sharply the previous week. What’s more, the number of active North American oil rigs fell by two in the week ended June 30, from 758 to 756 rigs, the first such contraction since January, according to the Baker Hughes Rig Count.
Although constructive, there’s still quite a bit of terrain to cover before oil reaches the low- to mid-$50s we saw at the start of the year.
Where’s the Wheat?
As I told you back in May, the U.S. reclaimed its longstanding title as the world’s number one wheat exporter this year, displacing Russia, whose weak currency gave the Eastern European country a competitive advantage.
We might soon slip to second place yet again, for two primary reasons: 1) low U.S. wheat plantings and 2) severe droughts and unexpectedly hot weather conditions in the Northern Plains.
According to a March report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), American farmers just aren’t planting wheat like they used to. Not only are we seeing shrinkage in the acreage devoted to the amber grain—more and more farmers are switching to soybeans—but wheat seedings are down for a second straight year. The USDA, in fact, estimates them to be at their lowest level ever since records began nearly 100 years ago in 1919.
As to the second point, severe to extreme hot and dry weather conditions in the Northern Plains—specifically in areas of Montana and the Dakotas—are putting wheat (and corn) on the defensive. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, parts of Montana just experienced their driest May and June in 99 years and the driest January through June since 1983. Last week alone, temperatures in the region surged into the 90s and 100s, about 15 to 20 degrees above the norm. These conditions are expected to persist for several more weeks.

click to enlarge
Supply constraints have pushed the grain up 25 percent so far this year to a nearly two-year high. A bushel now costs a little over $5, but some analysts see it rising above $6 and $7.
Precious Metals Continue to Shine
Also benefiting from limited supply is silver, which climbed nearly 4.5 percent as of June 30. The Silver Institute reported in May that global silver mine production in 2016 declined for the first time in 14 years on lower-than-expected output from lead, zinc and gold projects. World supply decreased 0.6 percent year-over-year, or about 32.6 million ounces.
Meanwhile, silver’s use in solar photovoltaic (PV) cells hit a new record high last year, further boosting demand. As I shared with you in May, solar ranked as the number one source of new electric generating capacity in the U.S. in 2016, followed by natural gas and wind.
In the first half of 2017, palladium, the silvery-white metal used in the production of catalytic converters, has surged to a 16-year high on speculative demand.

click to enlarge
At first blush, this trade might seem counterintuitive. After all, gas-powered vehicles, which use catalytic converters to control emissions, are expected to be surpassed in sales by electric vehicles, which do not require palladium, as early as 2040. Volvo just announced that it would completely phase out gas-only vehicles by 2019. Meanwhile, Tesla’s first mass-market battery electric vehicle (BEV) finally hit production last week.
Driving palladium’s rally this year, though, are bets that European car buyers will soon be switching from diesel-burning to gas-burning cars because of emissions concerns.









Palladium—one of the rarest elements on earth and mined almost exclusively in Russia and South Africa—is the smallest precious metals market, making its prices particularly vulnerable to such speculative trading. It’s achieved near-price parity with its sister metal, platinum, for the first time in two decades.  
On the other end of the spectrum is gold, whose market is larger than many major global stock and bond markets. Those include U.K. gilts, German bunds, the FTSE 100 Index, the Hang Seng Index and others.
Up 7.75 percent in the first six months, gold was supported largely by strong demand in India as consumers made their purchases ahead of the government’s Goods and Services Tax (GST), in effect since July 1, which levies a 3 percent tax on gold.
The impact of the country’s demonetization in December is also still being felt, with Indians’ confidence in fiat currencies tested. I believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheme to combat black money and public corruption, while admirable, has only reinforced Indians’ faith in the yellow metal as a store of value.
With consumer prices in the U.S. possibly set to begin rising on President Trump’s more protectionist policies—once he can get them enacted—gold priced in dollars could also be headed higher.
The Road Ahead
There’s a lot we’ll be keeping our eyes on in the second half of the year. For one, look to India’s upcoming Diwali holiday and fourth-quarter wedding season, during which gold gift-giving is considered auspicious.
Earlier in the year, I was excited about Trump’s ambitious infrastructure agenda, which would have greatly boosted domestic demand for base metals and energy. But with the Senate still locked in negotiations over what to do about Obamacare, an infrastructure deal looks as if it’s months if not years away.
Finally, I think with Tesla firing up its Nevada-based Gigafactory, investors would be prudent to keep their eyes on aluminum, cobalt, nickel and especially copper, as electric vehicles use around three times as much of the red metal as conventional vehicles. Lithium, which I featured back in March, is also expected to be a beneficiary of the move to BEVs.

Investor Beware! What Does the Illinois Budget Crisis Mean for Your Bond Fund?
July 6, 2017

A recent Capital Economics (CE) report shines an unforgiving light on Illinois’ ongoing budget woes—and what it finds isn’t pretty. The crisis, which has affected every level of government in the state, is a cautionary tale for not only public spending run amok but also independent investors taking too large of a risk by seeking high yields.
The Land of Lincoln’s credit is already the lowest-rated in the union and, until recently, its debt came precariously close to being downgraded to “junk.” Were this to happen, it would become the first state ever to receive such an ignoble rating.
The state’s 10-year bond yield has soared in recent months, which might attract certain unwary speculators. It’s our belief, however, that such debt should generally be avoided, as the risks are especially high.

click to enlarge
As I write this, a state budget could possibly be successfully negotiated, making it the first time in over two years that Illinois has operated with a budget. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner already vetoed the first bill that reached his desk, which includes tax hikes, but the veto was immediately overridden by the State Senate and is now headed for the House.
No matter the outcome, the point here is that political dysfunction is unfavorable—to put it lightly—and muni investors should remain cautious.
Illinois isn’t the only state facing problems. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin are all (or were) mired in similar budgetary impasses. New Jersey public beaches reopened just in time for July 4 celebrations after a high-profile government shutdown closed them down.
For many muni investors, navigating around these numerous pitfalls might seem overwhelming. That’s why I believe an actively-managed municipal bond fund such as our Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX) could be the solution.
More than 95 percent of NEARX is invested in munis that hold between an A and AAA investment-grade rating as of March 31. What this means is we’ve historically avoided exposure to debt issued by poorly-managed municipalities.
We also like to stay on the short end of the yield curve, especially now that the Federal Reserve has begun a new interest rate cycle. When rates rise, bond prices fall, and short- and intermediate-term munis are less sensitive to rate increases than longer-term munis whose maturities are further out.
To learn more about how rates affect municipal bonds, read our whitepaper.
On the Brink of Bankruptcy
Illinois’ total debt currently stands at about $60 billion, according to Capital Economics, which is above Detroit’s $20 billion bankruptcy in 2013 and just below Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt. The state’s unfunded pensions—for teachers, professors, state employees, judges, emergency personnel and more—could be as high as $250 billion. That puts each Illinoisan on the hook for an estimated $56,000.
Political dysfunction and mismanagement are bad enough, but the state’s adverse demographics make matters even worse.
Illinois is one of only four states whose populations shrank over the past five years, the others being Connecticut, Vermont and West Virginia. CE estimates that over the next decade, the state’s population could grow only 2.2 percent, far below the national average. The number of retirees, meanwhile, could surge 34 percent.

click to enlarge
That means fewer working-age Illinoisans are expected to be counted on to support retirees in the coming years, driving up the amount of unfunded pensions even higher.
So even if the Illinois government can resolve its budget soon, we see this as only a short-term fix. The state has even larger obstacles emerging on the horizon.
Our Solution
Again, this is why I think an actively-managed muni fund like NEARX is an attractive solution. Whereas other muni funds might accumulate Illinois debt based on its high yield, regardless of risk, we generally have stuck to investment-grade munis.
It must be said that if you look at NEARX’s holdings today, you’ll see that Illinois is one of its top issuers. The bonds were purchased at an earlier time, before the state’s budgetary problems really began to worsen. We haven’t accumulated any more since it became clear to us that the risks were too great.
We continue to hold the debt because we’re confident the state’s government can successfully unravel the political gridlock and arrive at a short-term resolution. It’s the state’s long-term demographic risks that investors should especially worry about. Our longest Illinois bonds mature in 2021, and as long as the state doesn’t default in the next four years—which, in our opinion, is highly unlikely—we should get a good return on the bonds based on their yield when they were purchased.

Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Though the Near-Term Tax Free Fund seeks minimal fluctuations in share price, it is subject to the risk that the credit quality of a portfolio holding could decline, as well as risk related to changes in the economic conditions of a state, region or issuer. These risks could cause the fund’s share price to decline. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local taxes and at times the alternative minimum tax. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes.
A bond’s credit quality is determined by private independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C).
The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests at least 80 percent of its net assets in investment-grade municipal securities. At the time of purchase for the fund's portfolio, the ratings on the bonds must be one of the four highest ratings by Moody's Investors Services (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa) or Standard & Poor's Corporation (AAA, AA, A, BBB). Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C). In the event a bond is rated by more than one of the ratings organizations, the highest rating is shown.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

Venezuela on the Brink—An Opportunity for Oil Investors?
July 28, 2017

By Frank Holmes
CEO and Chief Investment Officer
		U.S. Global Investors

Venezuela is sliding closer and closer toward the brink, and things look as if they’ll get worse, unfortunately, before they improve.
A country that boasts the largest proven oilfield in the world should not be facing such dire food and medicine shortages, not to mention rampant protests and violence in the streets. But that’s what happens when far-left, authoritarian socialist regimes threaten to dissolve economic freedom, the rule of law and democracy itself.
As you might have heard, Venezuelans will be participating in an election this Sunday that could permanently amend the country’s constitution for the worse. Depending on the outcome, President Nicolas Maduro is poised to become the world’s next absolute dictator.









On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued economic sanctions on 13 current and former Venezuela government officials in an effort to encourage Maduro to drop the election, which—let’s be honest—is likely rigged in his favor. According to Transparency International, Venezuela is among the most corrupt countries on the planet, ranking 166 out of 176 in 2016.
So why am I telling you this? Again, Venezuela sits atop the world’s largest proven oil patch. Crude accounts for roughly 95 percent of its export earnings. If Maduro does not relent, the U.S. could very possibly target the country’s oil industry next.
As Evercore ISI put it this week, the Treasury Department’s decision is “the first step toward comprehensive sectoral sanctions, including crude oil imports into the U.S.”
This would be phenomenally disruptive to Venezuela’s already fragile economy. Right now, the U.S. is the country’s top cash-generating market. Unlike most other markets, the U.S. pays its oil import invoices in full and on time. Venezuela could always boost exports to other existing clients, but the cash would dry up.
To be fair, such a move wouldn’t be exactly painless for the U.S. either. Venezuela is currently its third-largest supplier of crude, following Canada and Saudi Arabia. Several large American producers, including Chevron, Halliburton and Schlumberger, have joint-venture contracts with Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the South American country’s state-run oil company. And a number of oil refineries in the U.S. are equipped specifically to handle Venezuela’s notoriously extra-heavy crude.       

click to enlarge
Speaking to MarketWatch this week, Oil Price Information Service energy analyst Tom Kloza said the “possibility of chaos” in Venezuela could adequately spur an oil rally that the most recent global production cuts have failed to achieve. Despite the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) December agreement to trim output in an effort lift prices, crude fell more than 14 percent in the first six months of 2017 and is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years. 
Venezuela’s vote this weekend, followed closely by fresh U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, could be the “only true element that would change the dynamic for crude,” Kloza says.
Crude Gains on Inventory Draw
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude climbed to a nearly two-month high this week—but not entirely in response to the upcoming Venezuela vote. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude oil inventories, not including those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), sharply fell 7.2 million barrels in the week ended July 21. Stocks now stand at slightly more than 483 million barrels. Although still historically high, inventories have now decreased for four straight weeks.

click to enlarge
On Tuesday, oil jumped 3.34 percent, its biggest one-day gain since November 2016. And with only one more trading day left in July, the commodity is on track to have its first positive month since February.
Also supporting oil right now is speculation that domestic producers could soon start slashing capital budgets after months of depressed prices. Anadarko Petroleum made headlines this week after becoming the first major U.S. producer to announce cuts. The Texas-based company plans to trim $300 million from its 2017 budget.
But don’t expect domestic output to slacken anytime soon. In its Short-Term Energy Outlook, released this week, the EIA forecasts crude production to reach a record high of 9.9 million barrels a day on average in 2018. That would push it over the previous record of 9.6 million barrels a day, set way back in 1970.

click to enlarge
Not everyone agrees with this assessment. In a report this week, Capital Economics writes that “after more than a year of steady gains, the number of active drilling rigs will decline in the second half of the year. Accordingly, while mining structures investment probably posted another rise in the second quarter, these gains won’t be repeated in the second half of the year.”

click to enlarge
It’s important to remember, though, that a common theme among American frackers is that operations have become exceedingly more efficient than ever before. When oil prices collapsed more than two years ago and rigs were mothballed, output remained strong. So it’s possible that even with fewer rigs actively pumping crude, and less capital going into mining structures, we could still see domestic production reach 10 million barrels a day by next year.
OPEC Compliance at Six-Month Low
Obstructing price appreciation right now is news that a number of OPEC countries are not complying with production guidance laid out earlier in the year. The compliance rate fell from 95 percent in May to a six-month low of 78 percent in June, with monthly output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela totaling more than what should be allowed.
Meanwhile, Libya and Nigeria—which are exempt from the OPEC agreement because recent political instability in those countries knocked out months’ worth of production—dramatically increased output that reportedly has Saudi Arabia worried.
Peak Oil Demand in 10 Years?
Looking ahead on the demand side, we could see global oil consumption peak as soon as the late 2020s or early 2030s.









That’s according to Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell. Speaking to CNBC yesterday, van Beurden cited growth in electric vehicle sales as well as countries switching from fossil fuels to renewables as major catalysts that would trigger peak demand much sooner than previous estimates. Back in November, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it didn’t expect demand to peak before 2040.
But things are changing more rapidly every day. Last month, Volkswagen—the world’s number one manufacturer by sales—announced it would cease selling fossil fuel-burning automobiles by 2020. Both France and the United Kingdom recently said gas and diesel cars would be banned by 2040. India, the fastest growing automobile market, set a similar target for 2030.
Even when oil demand peaks—whether in 2030 or 2040—it won’t “go out of fashion overnight,” van Beurden said. Planes, ships and heavy trucks will continue using fossil fuels all around the globe, and smaller emerging markets will not be able to make the transition to renewables so easily as larger economies such as Western Europe, China and India.
“Supply will shrink faster than demand can shrink,” he explained, “and therefore, working on oil and gas projects will remain relevant for many decades to come.”
Shell reported knockout second-quarter earnings as cash generation rose sharply. The Anglo-Dutch producer’s earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $1.9 billion in the June quarter, a whopping 703 percent increase over the same period last year. Free cash flow stood at an incredible $12.1 billion, up from negative $3.1 billion during the same quarter in 2016.
With the price of oil having averaged $45 a barrel for the past two years, Shell will remain “very disciplined” going forward, van Beurden said.

Strengths

Telecommunication was the best performing sector of the week, increasing by 6.98 percent versus an overall flat reading of 0.00 percent for the S&P 500.
Boeing was the best performing stock for the week, increasing 13.73 percent.
Facebook beat estimates across the board. It reported earnings of $1.32 a share on revenue of $9.32 billion as the number of both daily and monthly active users increased.

Weaknesses

Health care was the worst performing sector for the week, falling 1.26 percent versus an overall flat reading of 0.00 percent for the S&P 500.
Seagate Technology was the worst performing stock for the week, falling 17.61 percent.
Twitter's second quarter earnings report mentioned that the company added zero new users over the last quarter. The stock plunged 10 percent as a result.

Opportunities

In the latest earnings conference call, Hershey’s CEO listed online retail as a major focus and potential growth area for the company. She also discussed collaboration with brick-and-mortar retailers as well as efforts to better accommodate the needs of online shoppers.
Samsung reported its earnings results for the latest quarter, posting a strong 89 percent year-over-year growth in net profit. It grew revenue by 19.8 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of semiconductors, display panels and the firm's high-end smartphone.
Coca-Cola’s strategy to diversify into healthier beverages is working as it beat estimates in its latest earnings report, mainly as a result of demand for healthier non-carbonated beverages.

Threats

Since the start of the economic recovery, stock prices have closely tracked the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. However, while the Fed's balance sheet has stayed mostly unchanged in 2017, the S&P 500 has continued to rise, with an almost 12 percent year-to-date return. According to Byron Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone's private wealth solutions group, this is a troublesome development. "This divergence is disturbing, particularly since the Fed is contemplating a balance sheet shrinkage starting in September," he wrote in a client note. The role of central bank liquidity is "receiving inadequate attention," he said.
The Senate probe into big pharma's impact in the opioid crisis is expanding. Senator Claire McCaskill called for adding drug makers Mallinckrodt, Endo, Teva, and Allergan to the probe, as well as distributors AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc.
Tobacco stocks plunged after the FDA announced it plans to cut nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.


The Economy and Bond Market
	 

	Strengths

After a lackluster start to 2017, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter, more than double than pace of the first quarter. The economy is now expected to advance 2.7 percent this quarter. Much of this growth came as a result of increased spending, which rose 2.8 percent compared to the same period last year. Exports of durable goods rose for the fifth straight month in June.
Consumer confidence in the United States jumped sharply from 117.3 in June to 121.1 in July, the Conference Board reported this week. That figure represents a 16-year high and underscores American consumers’ confidence that the U.S. economy is strengthening, with the labor market near full employment.
U.S. preliminary durable goods orders for June came in at 6.5 percent, ahead of the expected growth of 3.9 percent.

Weaknesses

New home sales for June increased to 610,000, which was an increase over the previous month, but lower than expectations. The weak housing market is impacted by lower housing inventory, and housing starts are below average.
The Brexit slowdown is taking hold as the U.K.'s economy grew at a 0.3 percent pace in the second quarter, according to preliminary data provided by the Office for National Statistics. This was the second-slowest growth since the beginning of 2016, trailing only the first quarter of this year.
The second quarter U.S. GDP Price Index came in at 1 percent, below the consensus 1.3 percent, demonstrating continued weakness in prices.

Opportunities

A confirmation of firm jobs growth and accelerating wages in next Friday's employment report would keep the Fed on a tightening path.
According to the head of U.S. multi-sector fixed income for Schroders, shorting duration will provide a significant cushion against rate rises.
The Bay Area Toll Authority plans to sell $1.1 billion of San Francisco Bay Area Toll Bridge revenue bonds. This marks the largest bond deal to come to the U.S. municipal market next week, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The authority's traffic and toll revenue has seen steady gains since 2010, according to bond documents.

Threats

The dollar’s slump has pushed it to the edge of a technical cascade, as it falls toward key levels based around weekly and monthly moving averages. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen on the Federal Reserve’s dovish turn and President Donald Trump’s struggles with Congress. The weakness could end up being part of a broader correction if the gauge closes July below 1,150, allowing for a deeper retracement to the 1,050 area that would erase the bulk of the spike that started in June 2014.

According to municipal strategists at Bank of American Merrill Lynch, it is likely to take two or more years to complete tax reform.


Alaska’s bonds have been downgraded twice in the past two weeks, falling victim to lower oil prices and structural imbalances. Kentucky was also lowered on notch, primarily because of pension payments.

Gold Market
	 

	This week spot gold closed at $1,269.93, up $14.88 per ounce, or 1.19 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 2.02 percent. Junior-tiered stocks underperformed seniors for the week, as the S&P/TSX Venture Index rose just 1.53 percent. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar Index continued lower this week by 0.59 percent.

Strengths

The best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 4.29 percent on hedge fund managers increasing their bullish positioning on the metal as expectations of increased usage in automotive catalyst to curb pollution. China’s purchase of bullion bars in the first half of the year rose 51 percent, reports Bloomberg, setting gold up for a sixth monthly gain in seven. China gold demand rose 545.23 tons, including gold bars to 158.40 tons. And as global gold prices retreat, China purchased more bullion from Hong Kong in June.
The dollar dropped as gold rose this week following signals from the Federal Reserve that inflation remains below target, reports Bloomberg, fueling speculation that the central bank will not rush to raise rates. The Fed commented that the balance sheet unwind will start “relatively soon.”
The dollar held near the lowest in more than a year, with gold futures reaching the highest since mid-June. “Dollar weakness and U.S. political concerns are lending support to gold,” said Guotai Junan Futures, a Chinese brokerage. The widening investigation into President Donald Trump, threatening to derail his economic agenda, has also spurred haven demand for the yellow metal, Bloomberg writes.

The worst performing precious metal for the week was platinum, essentially flat by the end of the week.  Part of the weakness related to weaker diesel engine demand. In addition, The U.K. became the latest European country to mark the end of the line for diesel and gasoline fueled cars, reports Bloomberg, as the government said it will ban sales of the vehicles by 2040. “The global shift toward electric vehicles will create upheaval across a number of sectors, from oil majors harmed by reduced gasoline demand to spark plug and fuel injection makers whose products aren’t needed by plug-in cars,” the article reads.
Tanzania President John Magufuli is demanding Barrick Gold’s Chairman John Thornton to honor his pledge regarding how the company will compensate Tanzania over mineral concentrates, reports All Africa Global Media. If Thornton doesn’t come to the negotiation table with the government, Barrick could risk closure of its mines or losing the mines to locals so that they can pay tax revenue. Acacia Mining was recently handed a $190 billion tax bill and fine from the Tanzanian government. According to Bloomberg, that is 70 times the record penalty that the EU dished out to Google last month and would take centuries to pay.
Gold’s 120-day volatility is at the lowest since 2005, reports Bloomberg, and in the past four months gold prices moved in a 7.6 percent range, the least in 10 years. “While irritating for traders who make a living betting on strong moves, the sleepy gold market also reflects stability in other assets, with measures of global shares at record highs,” the article reads.

Opportunities

According to Bloomberg, bankers and accomplished financiers are leaving lucrative careers and salaries to get into one of the hottest financial instruments around right now: initial coin offerings (ICOs). As resentment mounts over central bank policies and negative interest rates, interest in untraditional investment vehicles has mounted – such as precious metals and cryptocurrencies (recently sparking comparisons of bitcoin to gold). Interestingly enough, due to the increased popularity of ICOs, U.S. regulators are now stepping in. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s Report of Investigation found that tokens offered and sold by a certain virtual organization were indeed securities and therefore subject to federal laws. With people moving their money into electronic currencies outside of the purview of regulators and their ability to collect taxes, this has given gold a run for its ability to attract investors. If regulators can force tax IDs to be attached to cryptocurrency accounts, that could portend a run on such speculation.
In a note to clients dated July 20, J.P. Morgan analysts commented that gold is set to benefit from slow U.S. inflation, a weaker dollar and “political wrangling in Washington,” reports Bloomberg. And if the yellow metal manages to break out from between two decade-old trend lines that are getting closer together, it could get a lot less boring, notes another Bloomberg article. “Since late 2015, the triangle pattern has kept prices between about $1,050 and $1,380 an ounce,” the article reads. Strategist Jonathan Butler adds that once these long-term trends get broken, it usually marks a turning point for the market.

India’s trade ministry sees scope for lowering the import tax on gold, reports Bloomberg, as the current account deficit improves. “It will be one of the strong recommendations on the budgetary side from the ministry,” said Manoj Dwivedi, joint secretary at the trade ministry. More encouraging news on the gold front comes from Kirkland Lake Gold and its Fosterville mine. As Macquarie reports, the underground reserves at Fosterville increased 110 percent to over 1 million ounces at 17.9 grams per ton, and well above expectations. Macquarie also put out a positive note on AuRico Metals, which has two high-quality royalties on Fosterville and Young-Davidson. AuRico’s target is up again on more production and a longer life at Fosterville.

Threats

“If trillions of dollars of asset purchases under quantitative easing helped ease financial conditions, will the reversal tighten financial conditions, and by how much?” This question from the Financial Times, and highlighted by MacroStrategy Partnership this week, puts quantitative tightening (QT) in the spotlight. The same way quantitative easing (QE) expanded money supply and nominal GDP, QT could gradually shrink money supply, a move that is “unlikely to be frictionless” in a vulnerable economy, writes MacroStrategy.  The Fed hasn’t been waiting around for this topic to come up, since it has been experimenting with reverse repos to see the impact of QT. Unfortunately, the answer to the above question isn’t very pretty. One implication involves the collapse of first quarter 2017 U.S. bank annualized quarterly loan growth to 0.8 percent, from a robust 6.2 percent in the second quarter of 2016, the report continues.
Russia threatened to retaliate against new sanctions passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, reports Bloomberg, claiming it made it all but impossible to achieve the Trump administration’s goal of improved relations. According to Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house, Russia has prepared “economic and political measures that will be adopted if the Senate and Trump support the bill,” reports RIA Novosti news. Relations between the two countries “are at such a low level that we have nothing to lose,” by retaliating, he said.
Looking to shore up government finances, Brazil has unveiled plans to raise revenue from mining royalties by 80 percent, Reuters reports. “This new condition will increase the risk of loss of competitiveness in the international market for ores,” mining industry body IBRAM said in a statement. A slow economic recovery in Brazil has forced the government to find new sources of revenue, Reuters continues. Other dim news in the mining sector comes from South Africa, where a handful of companies are preparing a multimillion dollar settlement with as many as 100,000 former workers who suffer from debilitating and deadly lung disease, reports Bloomberg.


Energy and Natural Resources Market
	 

	Strengths

Brent oil was the best performing commodity this week, rising 9.5 percent. The commodity benefited from news suggesting China oil demand may grow at a 2.5 percent rate over the next four years, according to Sinopec. In addition, oil services firm Halliburton suggested the surge in U.S. shale output could stall as prices continue to trade range-bound. 
The best performing sector this week was the S&P/TSX Diversified Metals and Mining Index. The index rose 9.1 percent owing to the surge in copper prices, which posted its best weekly advance since at least November last year on news that China may soon ban the import of scrap copper metal.
Anglo American PLC, the London-based diversified miner, was the best performing stock this week finishing up 14.1 percent. The company posted strong quarterly and semi-annual results, and surprised market participants by announcing an early resumption to its dividend, which had been discontinued in 2015 as a result of low commodity prices.

Weaknesses

Lumber was the worst performing commodity this week dropping 2.3 percent. The commodity dropped after numerous Canadian producers announced they would resume operations at their B.C. mills, which had been threatened by wild fires over the previous weeks.
The worst performing sector this week was the S&P 1500 Construction Materials Index. The index fell 0.6 percent despite positive quarterly reports from its constituents. The sector has lagged the S&P 500 Index as well as resource-focused indices as the political deadlock in Washington continues to delay the much anticipated fiscal spending and infrastructure bill.
The worst performing stock for the week was CVR Refining LP. The Texan refiner dropped 16.9 percent after reporting a quarterly loss due to lower than expected refining margins.

Opportunities

China’s GDP may grow at a faster pace in 2017 than initially anticipated. After a strong start to the year with GDP growth beats in both the first and second quarters, supported by a government infrastructure spending spree and a buoyant housing market, China’s State Information Center has said it now expects full-year GDP to grow at 6.8 percent, ahead of the initial 6.7 percent forecast.
Copper prices hit a two-year high this week as supplies dwindle while China threatens to ban scrap imports. The copper market has seen renewed interest as numerous labor and technical issues threaten to affect supply out of Chile, Peru and the DRC. Simultaneously, China has threatened to completely phase out imports of scrap metal, which would result in greater demand for raw and refined metal from global producers.

The sharp recovery in U.S. shale oil production may be about to stall, a move that should support prices according to oil services firm Halliburton Co. As crude prices continue to trade range-bound between $45 and $55 a barrel, producers have threatened to slash capital expenditures until prices recover further, a statement that has been interpreted by Halliburton. This, as shale activity shows signs of “plateauing” unless prices move higher to incentivize further capital deployment.

Threats

U.S. GDP growth for the second quarter posted a strong 2.6 percent advance; however, it disappointed investor analyst expectations of 2.7 percent growth. Further to that, GDP growth rates for the previous three quarters were revised lower, suggesting the strength in the U.S. economy may have been overstated. The negative revisions provide a negative read-through for the resource markets as the U.S. remains one of the top two consumers of most major commodities.
U.S. steel manufacturers may not get a favorable steel imports duty ruling this month after the Trump administration is signaling it will slow-walk the Section 232 probe into steel dumping. The administration missed a self-imposed June 2017 deadline for the review, and President Donald Trump indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he wants to finalize other efforts including tax reform first.
Outflows from U.S.-listed commodity ETFs totaled $1.31 billion in the week ended July 27, led lower by sizeable redemptions from precious metals funds. Energy focused funds also saw sizeable redemptions, while industrial metals funds were flat week-on-week.

China Region
	 

	Strengths

China Evergrande Group (3333 HK) soared 21.53 percent this week, the strongest stock in the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI).  The integrated property developer announced a positive outlook for first-half earnings, and even after some selling on Friday, the stock still closed out the week as the index’s strongest.
In a $1.3 billion transaction, Starbucks Corp. announced that it will be buying the rest of its East China joint venture, reports Bloomberg. This would mark the biggest deal ever for the popular coffee chain that sees the Asian nation as a huge growth opportunity.
Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh Stock Index rose 2.06 percent in the last five trading days.

Weaknesses

South Korea’s KOSPI Index fell 2.00 percent for the week.
South Korea’s preliminary second quarter GDP reading came in at 2.7 percent for the second quarter, in line with expectations but behind the first-quarter 2.9 percent reading.
Taiwan’s preliminary second-quarter GDP reading, at 2.1 percent, also came in a little lighter than expected and down from 2.6 percent the prior quarter. Expectations were 2.2 percent.

Opportunities

Louis Vuitton announced it will “go in alone” to China’s expanding e-commerce market, reports Bloomberg, in a bet that consumers will value relationships with the actual seller over big Internet names like Alibaba. In fact, according to data from Euromonitor, China is set to overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest luxury-goods market in the next four years.


click to enlarge

Tencent is in talks to invest $400 million in India’s biggest ride-hailing app Ola, reports Barron’s, whose story sourced four people familiar with the discussions. The investment would push Ola’s valuation to more than $4 billion, the article continues, giving it more cash to compete with Uber locally. Shares in Tencent were up again in Hong Kong trading on Thursday.
According to a forecast of 26 economists polled by Reuters, China’s official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is expected at 51.6 for July, down very slightly from June’s 51.7. The group also predicts the Caixin manufacturing PMI to be unchanged in July from June’s 50.4. Official PMI will be released July 31, while the Caixin PMI will be posted on August 1.

Threats

Answering a question during a security conference in Australia on Thursday, the U.S. Pacific Fleet commander said that he would be prepared to launch a nuclear strike on China if President Trump so ordered, reports Reuters. Admiral Scott Swift later commented that the question asked was an “outrageous hypothetical,” but explained that all members of the U.S. military had sworn an oath to obey officers and the U.S. president as commander in chief.
McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc. have been hit hard in the past by food safety scares, which can spread rapidly online in China and have “an outsized impact on sales,” writes Reuters. Perhaps this is why the McDonald’s China unit responded promptly to viral photos in the U.S. allegedly showing a moldy ice cream maker at one of the U.S. restaurants. Chinese media picked up on the reports, with some posting that it would put them off eating at the chain while others defended the well-known restaurant.
As part of new North Korea sanctions, the U.S. could target Chinese companies, reports CNN, “even as diplomats are working with Beijing at the UN to reach a new international agreement.” As the article points out, although China is a key ally for bringing pressure to bar on Pyongyang, the Asian nation is also a “major potential target” for sanctions that would limit North Korean trade and imports.  Another reported missile launch late in the week may further complicate matters.

Emerging Europe
	 

	Strengths

Turkey was the best performing country this week, gaining 80 basis points. The government continues to support the country’s growth after the failed coup attempt last July. The Finance Ministry is working on decreasing the corporate tax. The cut will happen on a sector-by-sector basis, and the tax rate could be cut to 5 percent depending on the sector.
The Polish zloty was the best performing currency this week, gaining 1.1 percent against the dollar. The zloty rebounded after the Polish president vetoed two out of three bills supporting judicial reform. His decision followed eight days of nationwide protests by Poles in defense of court independence and European Union (EU) threats of sanctions. 
The materials sector was the best performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Weaknesses

Greece was the worst performing country this week, losing 3 percent. On the positive side, Greece returned to the markets with a new five-year bond issue accepting EUR 3 billion with a final yield at 4.625 percent. Going forward focus will shift to the third review which will start in September.   
The Russian ruble was the worst performing currency this week, losing 60 basis points against the dollar. More talk in the U.S. about imposing additional sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential elections and its support for separatists in Ukraine has created negative sentiment.
The health care sector was the worst performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Opportunities

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) left its global growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 3.5 percent and 3.6 percent respectively. Underneath the surface, the IMF downgraded its forecast for U.S. growth by 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent for 2017 and 2018, due to less expansionary fiscal stance than previously anticipated. Offsetting the IMF’s downward revisions to U.S. growth were upward revisions to the eurozone and China.
The central bank of Turkey kept its rates unchanged as expected, leaving the one-week repo rate at 8 percent, the overnight rate at 9.25 percent and the liquidity rate at 12.25 percent. Capital Economics’ research team believes that this hawkish stance will not last for too much longer, predicting the central bank’s average cost of funding to be reduced from 12 percent to11.5 percent by year end and then to 9 percent in 2018.
Economic sentiment in the eurozone has hit a fresh decade high this month, pointing to rising momentum in the single currency area. Economic confidence nudged up 0.1 points to 111.2 in July, the best level since before the financial crisis hit in 2007, driven higher by a bump in confidence in Germany and the Netherlands.

Threats

Big brokers are warning investors that a stronger euro may put pressure on European earnings. More than half the revenue of the top European firms are generated outside the eurozone, according to Thomson Reuters, meaning the strengthening euro has an adverse impact on those revenues once they are brought home. The euro trades at a two-year high, and for strategists at Deutsche Bank the relatively weak start to European earnings season is partly due to the euro’s strength.

The European Court of Justice rejected a legal challenge mounted by Hungary and Slovakia against the EU decision to relocate refugees. According to Berenberg’s research, this increases the likelihood that Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary will have to pay a big fine for not accepting refugees. There are about 160,000 refugees to be relocated; Poland would need to take 7.5 percent of those, and Hungary and Czech around 2 percent. Last year the European Commission suggested a fine of EUR 250,000 per refugee not taken. The combined fine could add up to EUR 4.6 billion for the three central European countries, or around 0.7 percent of GDP.
The U.S. House of Representative and Senate passed a bill that would let Congress block any effort by Donald Trump to unilaterally weaken sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration. If Trumps signed this measure it would dilute his power. But rejecting it could lead to a veto override, as the bill cleared both chambers by wide margins, and lead to criticism that he is seeking to protect Russia. Russia is the worst performing emerging Europe market, losing 13 percent year to date.

Venezuela on the Brink—An Opportunity for Oil Investors?
July 28, 2017

By Frank Holmes
CEO and Chief Investment Officer
		U.S. Global Investors

Venezuela is sliding closer and closer toward the brink, and things look as if they’ll get worse, unfortunately, before they improve.
A country that boasts the largest proven oilfield in the world should not be facing such dire food and medicine shortages, not to mention rampant protests and violence in the streets. But that’s what happens when far-left, authoritarian socialist regimes threaten to dissolve economic freedom, the rule of law and democracy itself.
As you might have heard, Venezuelans will be participating in an election this Sunday that could permanently amend the country’s constitution for the worse. Depending on the outcome, President Nicolas Maduro is poised to become the world’s next absolute dictator.









On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued economic sanctions on 13 current and former Venezuela government officials in an effort to encourage Maduro to drop the election, which—let’s be honest—is likely rigged in his favor. According to Transparency International, Venezuela is among the most corrupt countries on the planet, ranking 166 out of 176 in 2016.
So why am I telling you this? Again, Venezuela sits atop the world’s largest proven oil patch. Crude accounts for roughly 95 percent of its export earnings. If Maduro does not relent, the U.S. could very possibly target the country’s oil industry next.
As Evercore ISI put it this week, the Treasury Department’s decision is “the first step toward comprehensive sectoral sanctions, including crude oil imports into the U.S.”
This would be phenomenally disruptive to Venezuela’s already fragile economy. Right now, the U.S. is the country’s top cash-generating market. Unlike most other markets, the U.S. pays its oil import invoices in full and on time. Venezuela could always boost exports to other existing clients, but the cash would dry up.
To be fair, such a move wouldn’t be exactly painless for the U.S. either. Venezuela is currently its third-largest supplier of crude, following Canada and Saudi Arabia. Several large American producers, including Chevron, Halliburton and Schlumberger, have joint-venture contracts with Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the South American country’s state-run oil company. And a number of oil refineries in the U.S. are equipped specifically to handle Venezuela’s notoriously extra-heavy crude.

Speaking to MarketWatch this week, Oil Price Information Service energy analyst Tom Kloza said the “possibility of chaos” in Venezuela could adequately spur an oil rally that the most recent global production cuts have failed to achieve. Despite the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) December agreement to trim output in an effort lift prices, crude fell more than 14 percent in the first six months of 2017 and is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years. 
Venezuela’s vote this weekend, followed closely by fresh U.S. Treasury Department sanctions, could be the “only true element that would change the dynamic for crude,” Kloza says.
Crude Gains on Inventory Draw
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude climbed to a nearly two-month high this week—but not entirely in response to the upcoming Venezuela vote. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude oil inventories, not including those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), sharply fell 7.2 million barrels in the week ended July 21. Stocks now stand at slightly more than 483 million barrels. Although still historically high, inventories have now decreased for four straight weeks.

On Tuesday, oil jumped 3.34 percent, its biggest one-day gain since November 2016. And with only one more trading day left in July, the commodity is on track to have its first positive month since February.
Also supporting oil right now is speculation that domestic producers could soon start slashing capital budgets after months of depressed prices. Anadarko Petroleum made headlines this week after becoming the first major U.S. producer to announce cuts. The Texas-based company plans to trim $300 million from its 2017 budget.
But don’t expect domestic output to slacken anytime soon. In its Short-Term Energy Outlook, released this week, the EIA forecasts crude production to reach a record high of 9.9 million barrels a day on average in 2018. That would push it over the previous record of 9.6 million barrels a day, set way back in 1970.

Not everyone agrees with this assessment. In a report this week, Capital Economics writes that “after more than a year of steady gains, the number of active drilling rigs will decline in the second half of the year. Accordingly, while mining structures investment probably posted another rise in the second quarter, these gains won’t be repeated in the second half of the year.”

click to enlarge
It’s important to remember, though, that a common theme among American frackers is that operations have become exceedingly more efficient than ever before. When oil prices collapsed more than two years ago and rigs were mothballed, output remained strong. So it’s possible that even with fewer rigs actively pumping crude, and less capital going into mining structures, we could still see domestic production reach 10 million barrels a day by next year.
OPEC Compliance at Six-Month Low
Obstructing price appreciation right now is news that a number of OPEC countries are not complying with production guidance laid out earlier in the year. The compliance rate fell from 95 percent in May to a six-month low of 78 percent in June, with monthly output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela totaling more than what should be allowed.
Meanwhile, Libya and Nigeria—which are exempt from the OPEC agreement because recent political instability in those countries knocked out months’ worth of production—dramatically increased output that reportedly has Saudi Arabia worried.
Peak Oil Demand in 10 Years?
Looking ahead on the demand side, we could see global oil consumption peak as soon as the late 2020s or early 2030s.









That’s according to Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell. Speaking to CNBC yesterday, van Beurden cited growth in electric vehicle sales as well as countries switching from fossil fuels to renewables as major catalysts that would trigger peak demand much sooner than previous estimates. Back in November, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it didn’t expect demand to peak before 2040.
But things are changing more rapidly every day. Last month, Volkswagen—the world’s number one manufacturer by sales—announced it would cease selling fossil fuel-burning automobiles by 2020. Both France and the United Kingdom recently said gas and diesel cars would be banned by 2040. India, the fastest growing automobile market, set a similar target for 2030.
Even when oil demand peaks—whether in 2030 or 2040—it won’t “go out of fashion overnight,” van Beurden said. Planes, ships and heavy trucks will continue using fossil fuels all around the globe, and smaller emerging markets will not be able to make the transition to renewables so easily as larger economies such as Western Europe, China and India.
“Supply will shrink faster than demand can shrink,” he explained, “and therefore, working on oil and gas projects will remain relevant for many decades to come.”
Shell reported knockout second-quarter earnings as cash generation rose sharply. The Anglo-Dutch producer’s earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $1.9 billion in the June quarter, a whopping 703 percent increase over the same period last year. Free cash flow stood at an incredible $12.1 billion, up from negative $3.1 billion during the same quarter in 2016.
With the price of oil having averaged $45 a barrel for the past two years, Shell will remain “very disciplined” going forward, van Beurden said.

Strengths

Telecommunication was the best performing sector of the week, increasing by 6.98 percent versus an overall flat reading of 0.00 percent for the S&P 500.
Boeing was the best performing stock for the week, increasing 13.73 percent.
Facebook beat estimates across the board. It reported earnings of $1.32 a share on revenue of $9.32 billion as the number of both daily and monthly active users increased.

Weaknesses

Health care was the worst performing sector for the week, falling 1.26 percent versus an overall flat reading of 0.00 percent for the S&P 500.
Seagate Technology was the worst performing stock for the week, falling 17.61 percent.
Twitter's second quarter earnings report mentioned that the company added zero new users over the last quarter. The stock plunged 10 percent as a result.

Opportunities

In the latest earnings conference call, Hershey’s CEO listed online retail as a major focus and potential growth area for the company. She also discussed collaboration with brick-and-mortar retailers as well as efforts to better accommodate the needs of online shoppers.
Samsung reported its earnings results for the latest quarter, posting a strong 89 percent year-over-year growth in net profit. It grew revenue by 19.8 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by strong sales of semiconductors, display panels and the firm's high-end smartphone.
Coca-Cola’s strategy to diversify into healthier beverages is working as it beat estimates in its latest earnings report, mainly as a result of demand for healthier non-carbonated beverages.

Threats

Since the start of the economic recovery, stock prices have closely tracked the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. However, while the Fed's balance sheet has stayed mostly unchanged in 2017, the S&P 500 has continued to rise, with an almost 12 percent year-to-date return. According to Byron Wien, the vice chairman of Blackstone's private wealth solutions group, this is a troublesome development. "This divergence is disturbing, particularly since the Fed is contemplating a balance sheet shrinkage starting in September," he wrote in a client note. The role of central bank liquidity is "receiving inadequate attention," he said.
The Senate probe into big pharma's impact in the opioid crisis is expanding. Senator Claire McCaskill called for adding drug makers Mallinckrodt, Endo, Teva, and Allergan to the probe, as well as distributors AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc.
Tobacco stocks plunged after the FDA announced it plans to cut nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.


The Economy and Bond Market
	 

	Strengths

After a lackluster start to 2017, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter, more than double than pace of the first quarter. The economy is now expected to advance 2.7 percent this quarter. Much of this growth came as a result of increased spending, which rose 2.8 percent compared to the same period last year. Exports of durable goods rose for the fifth straight month in June.
Consumer confidence in the United States jumped sharply from 117.3 in June to 121.1 in July, the Conference Board reported this week. That figure represents a 16-year high and underscores American consumers’ confidence that the U.S. economy is strengthening, with the labor market near full employment.
U.S. preliminary durable goods orders for June came in at 6.5 percent, ahead of the expected growth of 3.9 percent.

Weaknesses

New home sales for June increased to 610,000, which was an increase over the previous month, but lower than expectations. The weak housing market is impacted by lower housing inventory, and housing starts are below average.
The Brexit slowdown is taking hold as the U.K.'s economy grew at a 0.3 percent pace in the second quarter, according to preliminary data provided by the Office for National Statistics. This was the second-slowest growth since the beginning of 2016, trailing only the first quarter of this year.
The second quarter U.S. GDP Price Index came in at 1 percent, below the consensus 1.3 percent, demonstrating continued weakness in prices.

Opportunities

A confirmation of firm jobs growth and accelerating wages in next Friday's employment report would keep the Fed on a tightening path.
According to the head of U.S. multi-sector fixed income for Schroders, shorting duration will provide a significant cushion against rate rises.
The Bay Area Toll Authority plans to sell $1.1 billion of San Francisco Bay Area Toll Bridge revenue bonds. This marks the largest bond deal to come to the U.S. municipal market next week, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The authority's traffic and toll revenue has seen steady gains since 2010, according to bond documents.

Threats

The dollar’s slump has pushed it to the edge of a technical cascade, as it falls toward key levels based around weekly and monthly moving averages. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has fallen on the Federal Reserve’s dovish turn and President Donald Trump’s struggles with Congress. The weakness could end up being part of a broader correction if the gauge closes July below 1,150, allowing for a deeper retracement to the 1,050 area that would erase the bulk of the spike that started in June 2014.

According to municipal strategists at Bank of American Merrill Lynch, it is likely to take two or more years to complete tax reform.


Alaska’s bonds have been downgraded twice in the past two weeks, falling victim to lower oil prices and structural imbalances. Kentucky was also lowered on notch, primarily because of pension payments.

Gold Market
	 

	This week spot gold closed at $1,269.93, up $14.88 per ounce, or 1.19 percent. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 2.02 percent. Junior-tiered stocks underperformed seniors for the week, as the S&P/TSX Venture Index rose just 1.53 percent. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar Index continued lower this week by 0.59 percent.

Strengths

The best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 4.29 percent on hedge fund managers increasing their bullish positioning on the metal as expectations of increased usage in automotive catalyst to curb pollution. China’s purchase of bullion bars in the first half of the year rose 51 percent, reports Bloomberg, setting gold up for a sixth monthly gain in seven. China gold demand rose 545.23 tons, including gold bars to 158.40 tons. And as global gold prices retreat, China purchased more bullion from Hong Kong in June.
The dollar dropped as gold rose this week following signals from the Federal Reserve that inflation remains below target, reports Bloomberg, fueling speculation that the central bank will not rush to raise rates. The Fed commented that the balance sheet unwind will start “relatively soon.”
The dollar held near the lowest in more than a year, with gold futures reaching the highest since mid-June. “Dollar weakness and U.S. political concerns are lending support to gold,” said Guotai Junan Futures, a Chinese brokerage. The widening investigation into President Donald Trump, threatening to derail his economic agenda, has also spurred haven demand for the yellow metal, Bloomberg writes.

Weaknesses

The worst performing precious metal for the week was platinum, essentially flat by the end of the week.  Part of the weakness related to weaker diesel engine demand. In addition, The U.K. became the latest European country to mark the end of the line for diesel and gasoline fueled cars, reports Bloomberg, as the government said it will ban sales of the vehicles by 2040. “The global shift toward electric vehicles will create upheaval across a number of sectors, from oil majors harmed by reduced gasoline demand to spark plug and fuel injection makers whose products aren’t needed by plug-in cars,” the article reads.
Tanzania President John Magufuli is demanding Barrick Gold’s Chairman John Thornton to honor his pledge regarding how the company will compensate Tanzania over mineral concentrates, reports All Africa Global Media. If Thornton doesn’t come to the negotiation table with the government, Barrick could risk closure of its mines or losing the mines to locals so that they can pay tax revenue. Acacia Mining was recently handed a $190 billion tax bill and fine from the Tanzanian government. According to Bloomberg, that is 70 times the record penalty that the EU dished out to Google last month and would take centuries to pay.
Gold’s 120-day volatility is at the lowest since 2005, reports Bloomberg, and in the past four months gold prices moved in a 7.6 percent range, the least in 10 years. “While irritating for traders who make a living betting on strong moves, the sleepy gold market also reflects stability in other assets, with measures of global shares at record highs,” the article reads.

Opportunities

According to Bloomberg, bankers and accomplished financiers are leaving lucrative careers and salaries to get into one of the hottest financial instruments around right now: initial coin offerings (ICOs). As resentment mounts over central bank policies and negative interest rates, interest in untraditional investment vehicles has mounted – such as precious metals and cryptocurrencies (recently sparking comparisons of bitcoin to gold). Interestingly enough, due to the increased popularity of ICOs, U.S. regulators are now stepping in. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s Report of Investigation found that tokens offered and sold by a certain virtual organization were indeed securities and therefore subject to federal laws. With people moving their money into electronic currencies outside of the purview of regulators and their ability to collect taxes, this has given gold a run for its ability to attract investors. If regulators can force tax IDs to be attached to cryptocurrency accounts, that could portend a run on such speculation.
In a note to clients dated July 20, J.P. Morgan analysts commented that gold is set to benefit from slow U.S. inflation, a weaker dollar and “political wrangling in Washington,” reports Bloomberg. And if the yellow metal manages to break out from between two decade-old trend lines that are getting closer together, it could get a lot less boring, notes another Bloomberg article. “Since late 2015, the triangle pattern has kept prices between about $1,050 and $1,380 an ounce,” the article reads. Strategist Jonathan Butler adds that once these long-term trends get broken, it usually marks a turning point for the market.

India’s trade ministry sees scope for lowering the import tax on gold, reports Bloomberg, as the current account deficit improves. “It will be one of the strong recommendations on the budgetary side from the ministry,” said Manoj Dwivedi, joint secretary at the trade ministry. More encouraging news on the gold front comes from Kirkland Lake Gold and its Fosterville mine. As Macquarie reports, the underground reserves at Fosterville increased 110 percent to over 1 million ounces at 17.9 grams per ton, and well above expectations. Macquarie also put out a positive note on AuRico Metals, which has two high-quality royalties on Fosterville and Young-Davidson. AuRico’s target is up again on more production and a longer life at Fosterville.

Threats

“If trillions of dollars of asset purchases under quantitative easing helped ease financial conditions, will the reversal tighten financial conditions, and by how much?” This question from the Financial Times, and highlighted by MacroStrategy Partnership this week, puts quantitative tightening (QT) in the spotlight. The same way quantitative easing (QE) expanded money supply and nominal GDP, QT could gradually shrink money supply, a move that is “unlikely to be frictionless” in a vulnerable economy, writes MacroStrategy.  The Fed hasn’t been waiting around for this topic to come up, since it has been experimenting with reverse repos to see the impact of QT. Unfortunately, the answer to the above question isn’t very pretty. One implication involves the collapse of first quarter 2017 U.S. bank annualized quarterly loan growth to 0.8 percent, from a robust 6.2 percent in the second quarter of 2016, the report continues.
Russia threatened to retaliate against new sanctions passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, reports Bloomberg, claiming it made it all but impossible to achieve the Trump administration’s goal of improved relations. According to Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house, Russia has prepared “economic and political measures that will be adopted if the Senate and Trump support the bill,” reports RIA Novosti news. Relations between the two countries “are at such a low level that we have nothing to lose,” by retaliating, he said.
Looking to shore up government finances, Brazil has unveiled plans to raise revenue from mining royalties by 80 percent, Reuters reports. “This new condition will increase the risk of loss of competitiveness in the international market for ores,” mining industry body IBRAM said in a statement. A slow economic recovery in Brazil has forced the government to find new sources of revenue, Reuters continues. Other dim news in the mining sector comes from South Africa, where a handful of companies are preparing a multimillion dollar settlement with as many as 100,000 former workers who suffer from debilitating and deadly lung disease, reports Bloomberg.


Energy and Natural Resources Market
	 

	Strengths

Brent oil was the best performing commodity this week, rising 9.5 percent. The commodity benefited from news suggesting China oil demand may grow at a 2.5 percent rate over the next four years, according to Sinopec. In addition, oil services firm Halliburton suggested the surge in U.S. shale output could stall as prices continue to trade range-bound. 
The best performing sector this week was the S&P/TSX Diversified Metals and Mining Index. The index rose 9.1 percent owing to the surge in copper prices, which posted its best weekly advance since at least November last year on news that China may soon ban the import of scrap copper metal.
Anglo American PLC, the London-based diversified miner, was the best performing stock this week finishing up 14.1 percent. The company posted strong quarterly and semi-annual results, and surprised market participants by announcing an early resumption to its dividend, which had been discontinued in 2015 as a result of low commodity prices.

Weaknesses

Lumber was the worst performing commodity this week dropping 2.3 percent. The commodity dropped after numerous Canadian producers announced they would resume operations at their B.C. mills, which had been threatened by wild fires over the previous weeks.
The worst performing sector this week was the S&P 1500 Construction Materials Index. The index fell 0.6 percent despite positive quarterly reports from its constituents. The sector has lagged the S&P 500 Index as well as resource-focused indices as the political deadlock in Washington continues to delay the much anticipated fiscal spending and infrastructure bill.
The worst performing stock for the week was CVR Refining LP. The Texan refiner dropped 16.9 percent after reporting a quarterly loss due to lower than expected refining margins.

Opportunities

China’s GDP may grow at a faster pace in 2017 than initially anticipated. After a strong start to the year with GDP growth beats in both the first and second quarters, supported by a government infrastructure spending spree and a buoyant housing market, China’s State Information Center has said it now expects full-year GDP to grow at 6.8 percent, ahead of the initial 6.7 percent forecast.
Copper prices hit a two-year high this week as supplies dwindle while China threatens to ban scrap imports. The copper market has seen renewed interest as numerous labor and technical issues threaten to affect supply out of Chile, Peru and the DRC. Simultaneously, China has threatened to completely phase out imports of scrap metal, which would result in greater demand for raw and refined metal from global producers.

The sharp recovery in U.S. shale oil production may be about to stall, a move that should support prices according to oil services firm Halliburton Co. As crude prices continue to trade range-bound between $45 and $55 a barrel, producers have threatened to slash capital expenditures until prices recover further, a statement that has been interpreted by Halliburton. This, as shale activity shows signs of “plateauing” unless prices move higher to incentivize further capital deployment.

Threats

U.S. GDP growth for the second quarter posted a strong 2.6 percent advance; however, it disappointed investor analyst expectations of 2.7 percent growth. Further to that, GDP growth rates for the previous three quarters were revised lower, suggesting the strength in the U.S. economy may have been overstated. The negative revisions provide a negative read-through for the resource markets as the U.S. remains one of the top two consumers of most major commodities.
U.S. steel manufacturers may not get a favorable steel imports duty ruling this month after the Trump administration is signaling it will slow-walk the Section 232 probe into steel dumping. The administration missed a self-imposed June 2017 deadline for the review, and President Donald Trump indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he wants to finalize other efforts including tax reform first.
Outflows from U.S.-listed commodity ETFs totaled $1.31 billion in the week ended July 27, led lower by sizeable redemptions from precious metals funds. Energy focused funds also saw sizeable redemptions, while industrial metals funds were flat week-on-week.

China Region
	 

	Strengths

China Evergrande Group (3333 HK) soared 21.53 percent this week, the strongest stock in the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI).  The integrated property developer announced a positive outlook for first-half earnings, and even after some selling on Friday, the stock still closed out the week as the index’s strongest.
In a $1.3 billion transaction, Starbucks Corp. announced that it will be buying the rest of its East China joint venture, reports Bloomberg. This would mark the biggest deal ever for the popular coffee chain that sees the Asian nation as a huge growth opportunity.
Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh Stock Index rose 2.06 percent in the last five trading days.

Weaknesses

South Korea’s KOSPI Index fell 2.00 percent for the week.
South Korea’s preliminary second quarter GDP reading came in at 2.7 percent for the second quarter, in line with expectations but behind the first-quarter 2.9 percent reading.
Taiwan’s preliminary second-quarter GDP reading, at 2.1 percent, also came in a little lighter than expected and down from 2.6 percent the prior quarter. Expectations were 2.2 percent.

Opportunities

Louis Vuitton announced it will “go in alone” to China’s expanding e-commerce market, reports Bloomberg, in a bet that consumers will value relationships with the actual seller over big Internet names like Alibaba. In fact, according to data from Euromonitor, China is set to overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest luxury-goods market in the next four years.

Tencent is in talks to invest $400 million in India’s biggest ride-hailing app Ola, reports Barron’s, whose story sourced four people familiar with the discussions. The investment would push Ola’s valuation to more than $4 billion, the article continues, giving it more cash to compete with Uber locally. Shares in Tencent were up again in Hong Kong trading on Thursday.
According to a forecast of 26 economists polled by Reuters, China’s official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is expected at 51.6 for July, down very slightly from June’s 51.7. The group also predicts the Caixin manufacturing PMI to be unchanged in July from June’s 50.4. Official PMI will be released July 31, while the Caixin PMI will be posted on August 1.

Threats

Answering a question during a security conference in Australia on Thursday, the U.S. Pacific Fleet commander said that he would be prepared to launch a nuclear strike on China if President Trump so ordered, reports Reuters. Admiral Scott Swift later commented that the question asked was an “outrageous hypothetical,” but explained that all members of the U.S. military had sworn an oath to obey officers and the U.S. president as commander in chief.
McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc. have been hit hard in the past by food safety scares, which can spread rapidly online in China and have “an outsized impact on sales,” writes Reuters. Perhaps this is why the McDonald’s China unit responded promptly to viral photos in the U.S. allegedly showing a moldy ice cream maker at one of the U.S. restaurants. Chinese media picked up on the reports, with some posting that it would put them off eating at the chain while others defended the well-known restaurant.
As part of new North Korea sanctions, the U.S. could target Chinese companies, reports CNN, “even as diplomats are working with Beijing at the UN to reach a new international agreement.” As the article points out, although China is a key ally for bringing pressure to bar on Pyongyang, the Asian nation is also a “major potential target” for sanctions that would limit North Korean trade and imports.  Another reported missile launch late in the week may further complicate matters.

Emerging Europe
	 

	Strengths

Turkey was the best performing country this week, gaining 80 basis points. The government continues to support the country’s growth after the failed coup attempt last July. The Finance Ministry is working on decreasing the corporate tax. The cut will happen on a sector-by-sector basis, and the tax rate could be cut to 5 percent depending on the sector.
The Polish zloty was the best performing currency this week, gaining 1.1 percent against the dollar. The zloty rebounded after the Polish president vetoed two out of three bills supporting judicial reform. His decision followed eight days of nationwide protests by Poles in defense of court independence and European Union (EU) threats of sanctions. 
The materials sector was the best performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Weaknesses

Greece was the worst performing country this week, losing 3 percent. On the positive side, Greece returned to the markets with a new five-year bond issue accepting EUR 3 billion with a final yield at 4.625 percent. Going forward focus will shift to the third review which will start in September.   
The Russian ruble was the worst performing currency this week, losing 60 basis points against the dollar. More talk in the U.S. about imposing additional sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential elections and its support for separatists in Ukraine has created negative sentiment.
The health care sector was the worst performing sector among eastern European markets this week.

Opportunities

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) left its global growth forecast for 2017 and 2018 unchanged at 3.5 percent and 3.6 percent respectively. Underneath the surface, the IMF downgraded its forecast for U.S. growth by 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent for 2017 and 2018, due to less expansionary fiscal stance than previously anticipated. Offsetting the IMF’s downward revisions to U.S. growth were upward revisions to the eurozone and China.
The central bank of Turkey kept its rates unchanged as expected, leaving the one-week repo rate at 8 percent, the overnight rate at 9.25 percent and the liquidity rate at 12.25 percent. Capital Economics’ research team believes that this hawkish stance will not last for too much longer, predicting the central bank’s average cost of funding to be reduced from 12 percent to11.5 percent by year end and then to 9 percent in 2018.
Economic sentiment in the eurozone has hit a fresh decade high this month, pointing to rising momentum in the single currency area. Economic confidence nudged up 0.1 points to 111.2 in July, the best level since before the financial crisis hit in 2007, driven higher by a bump in confidence in Germany and the Netherlands.

Threats

Big brokers are warning investors that a stronger euro may put pressure on European earnings. More than half the revenue of the top European firms are generated outside the eurozone, according to Thomson Reuters, meaning the strengthening euro has an adverse impact on those revenues once they are brought home. The euro trades at a two-year high, and for strategists at Deutsche Bank the relatively weak start to European earnings season is partly due to the euro’s strength.

The European Court of Justice rejected a legal challenge mounted by Hungary and Slovakia against the EU decision to relocate refugees. According to Berenberg’s research, this increases the likelihood that Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary will have to pay a big fine for not accepting refugees. There are about 160,000 refugees to be relocated; Poland would need to take 7.5 percent of those, and Hungary and Czech around 2 percent. Last year the European Commission suggested a fine of EUR 250,000 per refugee not taken. The combined fine could add up to EUR 4.6 billion for the three central European countries, or around 0.7 percent of GDP.
The U.S. House of Representative and Senate passed a bill that would let Congress block any effort by Donald Trump to unilaterally weaken sanctions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration. If Trumps signed this measure it would dilute his power. But rejecting it could lead to a veto override, as the bill cleared both chambers by wide margins, and lead to criticism that he is seeking to protect Russia. Russia is the worst performing emerging Europe market, losing 13 percent year to date.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

    Returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower
    or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so, upon
    redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain the most recent month end
    performance information and a prospectus, please call 800-GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com 

	The performance does not reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges.
	Quarterly (Standardized)
    performance reflects the full effect of the front-end sales charge. Other Period Performance does not
    reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges. Please consult your financial advisor
    for prospectus and for more information on mutual fund sales charges.
	
	(a) Total returns and average annual returns reflect changes in share price, reinvestment of distributions,
	and are net of expenses. The net asset value of a Fund is
	reduced on the ex-dividend (payment) date by the amount if the dividend paid. Of course, returns represent
	past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment returns and the principal value of an
	investment will fluctuate. When shares are redeemed they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
	Investing in small capitalization securities involves special challenges because these securities may trade
	less frequently and experience more abrupt price movements than large capitalization securities. Investing
	in micro capitalization securities may involve greater risks than investments in small, medium and large
	capitalization securities because the securities are subject to more abrupt or erratic movements in price.
	Investments in foreign securities involves risks not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic
	issues, including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks. Investing in gold is considered
	speculative and is affected by a variety of worldwide economic, financial and political factors. Funds
	concentrating in specific sectors may experience greater fluctuations in value than funds that are more
	diversified.
	

	(1) Maximum Sales Charge for Class A shares is a percentage of the initial investment and may be
	reduced based on the size of your investment. Class B and C shares have a contingent deferred sales charge
	when you redeem your shares depending on your holding period. Please see the Fund's Prospectus or contact
	your Adviser for a complete description of the applicable sales charge.
	

	(2) Gross Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund reflected as a percentage of the Fund's average
	daily net assets and do not include any voluntary or contractual fee waivers or expense limitations as
	described in the Fund Prospectus.
	

	(3) Net Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund including any voluntary or contractual fee waivers
	or expense limitations as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets. Where applicable, please see
	the Fund's Prospectus or contact your Adviser for a complete description of the fee waiver or expense
	limitation, the effective date and the expiration date.
	
	The Fund's share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund's portfolio securities.
	Stocks are subject to market, economic and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investment
	returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate.  When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth
	less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund.
	

    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before
    investing. The prospectus, which contains more complete information about this and other matters, should be read
    carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, please call 800 GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com .

“Mother of All Bubbles” Keeps Gold in Focus
July 24, 2017

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about last week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.

click to enlarge
As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro last week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.









“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note last week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Like gold in India, exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.

click to enlarge
Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.

click to enlarge
It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentioned in a note last week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

How to Get a Better Bargain on Your Investment with Emerging Europe
July 20, 2017

American equities have been a good place to invest during the current bull market, now in its eighth year. Since the November election, the S&P 500 Index has surged close to 16 percent. But this means that valuations continue to creep up, and political risk threatens to derail further gains as President Donald Trump’s high-growth agenda stumbles on even more roadblocks.
Investors might therefore be looking for an alternative. I believe one of the most attractive destinations for your investment dollars right now is emerging European countries. Below you can see a valuation comparison between U.S. and emerging European equities. Trading at 9.2 times earnings, the latter are offering quite a bargain for investors seeking a “better bang for the buck.”

click to enlarge
More than that, though, “core” Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries—including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary—are currently among the fastest growing in the world. In a recent series on the region, the Financial Times put it succinctly: “The former communist countries that have joined the European Union (EU) since 2004 offer superior growth to western Europe and many other emerging markets, combined with the benefits and protections of EU membership.”
Expectations for economic growth in CEE countries have changed rapidly and positively. The consensus forecast is now 2.5 percent growth this year, 0.3 percent points higher than expectations near the beginning of the year.
Next year could be even brighter, with analysts expecting 2.6 percent growth, 0.1 percentage point higher than earlier forecasts. Stronger-than-expected external demand in Western Europe, a tighter labor market, an attractive environment for foreign investment, government stimulus measures, easy financing conditions and the revival of EU structural funds are all supporting stronger growth in the region.
Manufacturing Continues to Strengthen
Loyal readers of Frank Talk know that we closely follow the purchasing manager’s index (PMI), which measures the strength of a country’s manufacturing industry. We’ve found it to be not only a handy gauge of future commodities demand but also a country’s or region’s economic growth potential.  
For the first time in recent memory, most emerging European economies’ PMIs are above the key 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Greece rose from 49.6 in May to 50.5 in June, the first time its manufacturing sector was in expansion mode in nearly a year.

click to enlarge
Russia grew at a much slower pace in June, however, with its PMI falling to 50.3, just above the threshold. But as I shared with you this week, Capital Economics analysts believe Russian growth in the coming quarters “will be stronger than most anticipate,” with the Central Bank of Russia loosening monetary policy even further.
The fact that all CEE countries are above 50 points to synchronized growth. It also suggests that the worst of the region’s economic woes following the global recession might finally be in the rearview mirror.
Poland the Next “Economic Powerhouse”?
Writing recently for the New York Times’ opinions section, Ruchier Sharma, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist, singled out Poland as the world’s likeliest next advanced economy, following South Korea’s entry into the high-income club 20 years ago.
I have to agree. As Sharma points out, Poland has seen average annual growth of 4 percent since 1991, the year it transitioned from communism to democracy. During that period, it hasn’t had a single down year, amazingly enough.
The Polish economy continued to grow at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the second quarter, as suggested by the May retail sales and industrial output data. According to mBank analysts, fiscal-year growth will slightly exceed 4 percent, driven by public investments recovery and persistently strong consumption. The real retail sales growth in the second quarter held close to the prior-quarter level, which means that consumption growth should remain at around 5 percent, mBank estimates.
Poland’s impressive ascent should only help strengthen other CEE countries, both economically and politically. Its president, Andrzej Duda, seems fully aware of this and has taken several important strides to improve not just Poland’s economy but the region’s as well. The Three Seas Initiative, spearheaded last year by Duda and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi?, seeks to connect the economies and infrastructure of 12 CEE countries between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas. A number of EU officials see the Initiative as a threat to the EU bloc’s unity, which might be partially why President Trump agreed to meet with Initiative members when he visited Poland last month.

Stocks on the Rise
Also contributing to CEE growth right now is the steadily weakening U.S. dollar, as Reuters reports. Prague stocks rose to a seven-week high this week, while Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange Index (BUX) continues to hit new all-time highs.

click to enlarge
Speaking of Hungary, its government is considering whether to lower personal income taxes to 10 percent from the current 15 percent. This would be a major boost to Hungarians’ disposable income, which is already rising at a breathtaking pace. Wage growth in April was an amazing 14.6 percent.
Again, the CEE region looks more and more like a good place to invest, not least of which because of its attractive discount to American equities.

Russia Collusion Story: A Big “Nothing Burger” or a Case for Gold?
July 17, 2017

Gold got a boost Friday on weaker-than-expected inflation and retail sales figures, casting doubt on the Federal Reserve’s ability to continue normalizing interest rates this year.
Consumer prices rose slightly in June, at their slowest pace so far this year. The consumer price index (CPI), released on Friday, showed the cost of living in America rising only 1.6 percent compared to the same month last year, significantly down from the most recent high of 2.8 percent in February and below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. Much of the decline was due to energy prices, which fell 1.6 percent from May.

click to enlarge
As I’ve explained elsewhere, CPI is an important economic indicator for gold investors to track. The yellow metal has historically responded positively when inflation rises—and especially when it pushes the yield on a government bond into negative territory. Why lock your money up in a 2-year or 5-year Treasury that’s guaranteed to give you a negative yield?









But right now the gold Fear Trade is being supported by what some are calling turmoil in the Trump administration. Last week the Russia collusion story took a new twist, with emails surfacing showing that Donald Trump Jr.; Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and now-senior advisor; and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort all agreed to meet with a Russian lawyer last summer under the pretext that she had dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Whether or not this meeting is “collusion” is not for me to say, but the optics of it certainly look bad, and it threatens to undermine the president’s agenda even more. For the first time last week, an article of impeachment was formally introduced on the House floor that accuses Trump of obstructing justice. The article is unlikely to go very far in the Republican-controlled House, but it adds further uncertainty to Trump’s ability to achieve some of his goals, including tax reform and infrastructure spending. I’ll have more to say on this later
A Contrarian View of China
A new report from CLSA shows that Asian markets and Europe were the top performers during the first six months of the year. Korea took the top spot, surging more than 25 percent, followed closely by China.

click to enlarge
Despite persistent negative “news” about China in the mainstream media, conditions in the world’s second-largest economy are improving. Consumption is up and household income remains strong. The number of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in China—those with at least 10 million renminbi ($1.5 million) in investable income—rose to 1.6 million last year, about nine times the number only 10 years ago. It’s estimated we could see as many as 1.87 million Chinese HNWIs by the end of 2017.
According to CLSA, global trade is robust, with emerging markets, and particularly China, driving most of the acceleration this year. In the first three months of 2017, global trade grew 4 percent compared to the same period last year, its fastest pace since 2011.
“Indeed the early months of 2017 have seen China become easily the biggest single country driver of Asian trade growth,” writes Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA.
A lot of this growth can be attributed to Beijing’s monumental One Belt, One Road infrastructure project, which I’ve highlighted many times before. But according to Alexious Lee, CLSA’s head of China industrial research, a “more nationalist America” in the first six months of the year has likely given China more leverage to assume “a larger global, and especially regional, leadership role.”
This comports with what I said back in January, in a Frank Talk titled “China Sets the Stage to Replace the U.S. as Global Trade Leader.” With President Donald Trump having already withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and promising to renegotiate or tear up other trade agreements—he recently tweeted that the U.S. has “made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history”—China has emerged, amazingly, as a champion of free trade, a position of power it will likely continue to capitalize on.
The country’s overseas construction orders have continued to expand, with agreements signed since 2013 valued at more than $600 billion.

Emerging Europe Expected to Remain Strong
Another recent report, this one from Capital Economics, shows that the investment case for emerging Europe remains strong in 2017. Russia is expected to strengthen over the next 12 months, while Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are likely to remain attractive.
“Russia’s economy has pulled out of recession and growth in the coming quarters will be stronger than most anticipate,” the research firm writes, adding that its central bank’s loosening of monetary policy should support the recovery even further.
To be sure, the region faces strong headwinds, including a rapidly aging population and the loss of an estimated 20 million skilled workers to foreign markets over the past 25 years, according to a July 11 presentation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But I believe that as conditions in central emerging Europe countries continue to improve, many of those workers will be returning home. Life in the region is not the same as it was 10 or 20 years ago, when good jobs might have been scarce. Firms are now growing at a healthy rate and hiring more workers. As you can see below, unemployment rates in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been falling steadily since at least 2012 and are now lower than the broader European Union.    

click to enlarge
This strength is reflected in emerging Europe’s capital markets. For the 12-month period as of July 12, Hungary’s Budapest Stock Exchange is up 38 percent. Poland’s WIG20 is up more than 43 percent. Meanwhile, the STOXX Europe 600 Index—which includes some of the largest Western European companies—has made gains of only 17 percent over the same period.

Markets Still Believe in Trump
As we all know, the mainstream media’s criticism and ire aren’t reserved for China alone. Ninety-nine percent of the media right now is against President Trump, for a number of reasons—some of them deserved, some of them not.
Markets, however, seem not to care what the media or polls have to say. The Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to hit new all-time highs. Even though it’s stalled a few times, the “Trump rally” appears to be in full-speed-ahead mode, more than eight months after the election.
Back in November, I wrote about one of my favorite books, James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds, which argues that large groups of people will nearly always be smarter and better at making predictions than an “elite” few. Surowiecki’s ideas were vindicated last year when investors accurately predicted Trump’s election, with markets turning negative between July 31 and October 31.
For the same reason, I think it’s important we pay close attention to what markets are forecasting today.
The White House is under siege on multiple fronts, which, as I said, has been positive for gold’s Fear Trade. But equity investors also seem to like the direction Trump is taking, whether it’s pushing for tax reform and deregulation or shaking up the “beltway party,” composed of deeply entrenched D.C. lobbyists and career bureaucrats. Just last week, the president made waves for firing a number of bureaucrats at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), long plagued by scandal and controversy. Since he took office in January, Trump has told more than 500 VA workers “You’re fired!”   
The Fundamentals of “Quantamental”
Of course, we look at so much more than government policy when making investment decisions. We take a blended approach of not only assessing fundamentals such as market share and returns on capital but also conducting quantitative analysis.
It’s this combination that some in the industry are calling “quantamental” investing. At first glance, “quantamental” might sound like nothing more than cute wordplay—not unlike “labsky,” “bullmation” and other clever names we give mixed-breed dogs—but it’s rapidly replacing traditional investment strategies at the institutional level.
Business Insider puts it in simple terms: “Quantamental managers combine the bottom-up stock-picking skills of fundamental investors with the use of computing power and big-data sets to test their hypotheses.”
See my Vancouver Investment Conference presentation, “What’s Driving Gold: The Invasion of the Quants,” to learn more about how we use quantitative analysis, machine learning and data mining.
Wall Street: The Birthplace of American Capitalism and Government

The concept of quantamentals helps explain our entry into smart-factor ETFs. As most of you already know, members of my team and I visited the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) three weeks ago to mark the launch of our latest ETF.
While there, Doug Yones, head of exchange-traded products at the NYSE, gave us a short history lesson about the exchange and surrounding area.
Most investors are aware that the NYSE, which is celebrating its 225th anniversary this year, is the epicenter of capitalism—not just in the U.S. but also globally.

What many people might not realize is that on the site where the exchange now stands, Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. treasury secretary, floated bonds to replace the debt the nascent country had incurred during the Revolutionary War.
Right next door to the NYSE is Federal Hall, where George Washington took his first oath of office in April 1789. The building today serves as a museum and memorial to the first U.S. president, whose statue now looks out over Wall Street and its passersby.
In this one single block of Wall Street, therefore, American capitalism and government were born. Here you can find the essential DNA of the American experiment, which, over the many years, has fostered our entrepreneurial spirit to form capital and to create new businesses and jobs. Growth, innovation and competition run through our veins, and that’s largely because of the events that unfolded centuries ago at the NYSE and Federal Hall.

Commodities Halftime Report: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff
July 10, 2017

Of the 14 commodities we track closely at U.S. Global Investors, wheat rose to take the top spot for the first half of 2017, returning more than 25 percent. The grain was followed closely by palladium—used primarily in the production of catalytic converters—which gained 24 percent.

Between the start of the year and June 30, the Bloomberg Commodity Index contracted 4.03 percent, with energy weighing down on the mostly strong performances of precious and industrial metals and agriculturals.
Contributing to metals’ gains was U.S. dollar weakness. During the first six months, the greenback lost 7.54 percent, responding partially to President Donald Trump’s comment in April that the dollar was “getting too strong.”
More recently, the president tweeted his thoughts on gas prices, which he pointed out were “the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years” for the July Fourth holiday. “I would like to see them go even lower,” he added.
Trump Goes to Warsaw
Speaking of Trump, I feel as if he has represented the U.S. and its values admirably during his visit to Europe last week. His speech in Warsaw sought to strengthen ties between America and Poland, which the New York Times just named the “next economic powerhouse.”

Trump drew attention to a danger that’s “invisible” yet every bit as dangerous as terrorism and extremism—namely, “the steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.”
The U.S. and Poland “became great not because of paperwork and regulations,” the president said, “but because people were allowed to chase their dreams and pursue their destinies.”
This is the Trump I believe voters elected last November. If he were only able to stay on message and give his Twitter account a rest, he might more easily help engender and inspire an environment that better reflects the vision he described to his Polish audience.
I’m also encouraged by his first one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. From what I’ve read, it sounds as if the two leaders managed to make some progress on Syria, with both sides agreeing to cooperate in maintaining “safe zones.”
Oil Embroiled
Regarding lower gas prices, Trump just might get his wish. Having fallen 14.30 percent in the first six months, oil is currently underperforming its price action of the past four years.

click to enlarge
Much of the thanks for oil’s slump goes to U.S. shale producers, which were quick to reactivate dormant rigs following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) December announcement that it would be cutting production. As a result, the market is awash in black gold. In May, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that domestic output should average 9.3 million barrels a day this year and nearly 10 million in 2018, a level unseen in the U.S. since 1970.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) popped above $47 a barrel last week, however, on news that oil and gas inventories in the U.S. dropped sharply the previous week. What’s more, the number of active North American oil rigs fell by two in the week ended June 30, from 758 to 756 rigs, the first such contraction since January, according to the Baker Hughes Rig Count.
Although constructive, there’s still quite a bit of terrain to cover before oil reaches the low- to mid-$50s we saw at the start of the year.
Where’s the Wheat?
As I told you back in May, the U.S. reclaimed its longstanding title as the world’s number one wheat exporter this year, displacing Russia, whose weak currency gave the Eastern European country a competitive advantage.
We might soon slip to second place yet again, for two primary reasons: 1) low U.S. wheat plantings and 2) severe droughts and unexpectedly hot weather conditions in the Northern Plains.
According to a March report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), American farmers just aren’t planting wheat like they used to. Not only are we seeing shrinkage in the acreage devoted to the amber grain—more and more farmers are switching to soybeans—but wheat seedings are down for a second straight year. The USDA, in fact, estimates them to be at their lowest level ever since records began nearly 100 years ago in 1919.
As to the second point, severe to extreme hot and dry weather conditions in the Northern Plains—specifically in areas of Montana and the Dakotas—are putting wheat (and corn) on the defensive. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, parts of Montana just experienced their driest May and June in 99 years and the driest January through June since 1983. Last week alone, temperatures in the region surged into the 90s and 100s, about 15 to 20 degrees above the norm. These conditions are expected to persist for several more weeks.

click to enlarge
Supply constraints have pushed the grain up 25 percent so far this year to a nearly two-year high. A bushel now costs a little over $5, but some analysts see it rising above $6 and $7.
Precious Metals Continue to Shine
Also benefiting from limited supply is silver, which climbed nearly 4.5 percent as of June 30. The Silver Institute reported in May that global silver mine production in 2016 declined for the first time in 14 years on lower-than-expected output from lead, zinc and gold projects. World supply decreased 0.6 percent year-over-year, or about 32.6 million ounces.
Meanwhile, silver’s use in solar photovoltaic (PV) cells hit a new record high last year, further boosting demand. As I shared with you in May, solar ranked as the number one source of new electric generating capacity in the U.S. in 2016, followed by natural gas and wind.
In the first half of 2017, palladium, the silvery-white metal used in the production of catalytic converters, has surged to a 16-year high on speculative demand.

click to enlarge
At first blush, this trade might seem counterintuitive. After all, gas-powered vehicles, which use catalytic converters to control emissions, are expected to be surpassed in sales by electric vehicles, which do not require palladium, as early as 2040. Volvo just announced that it would completely phase out gas-only vehicles by 2019. Meanwhile, Tesla’s first mass-market battery electric vehicle (BEV) finally hit production last week.
Driving palladium’s rally this year, though, are bets that European car buyers will soon be switching from diesel-burning to gas-burning cars because of emissions concerns.









Palladium—one of the rarest elements on earth and mined almost exclusively in Russia and South Africa—is the smallest precious metals market, making its prices particularly vulnerable to such speculative trading. It’s achieved near-price parity with its sister metal, platinum, for the first time in two decades.  
On the other end of the spectrum is gold, whose market is larger than many major global stock and bond markets. Those include U.K. gilts, German bunds, the FTSE 100 Index, the Hang Seng Index and others.
Up 7.75 percent in the first six months, gold was supported largely by strong demand in India as consumers made their purchases ahead of the government’s Goods and Services Tax (GST), in effect since July 1, which levies a 3 percent tax on gold.
The impact of the country’s demonetization in December is also still being felt, with Indians’ confidence in fiat currencies tested. I believe Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheme to combat black money and public corruption, while admirable, has only reinforced Indians’ faith in the yellow metal as a store of value.
With consumer prices in the U.S. possibly set to begin rising on President Trump’s more protectionist policies—once he can get them enacted—gold priced in dollars could also be headed higher.
The Road Ahead
There’s a lot we’ll be keeping our eyes on in the second half of the year. For one, look to India’s upcoming Diwali holiday and fourth-quarter wedding season, during which gold gift-giving is considered auspicious.
Earlier in the year, I was excited about Trump’s ambitious infrastructure agenda, which would have greatly boosted domestic demand for base metals and energy. But with the Senate still locked in negotiations over what to do about Obamacare, an infrastructure deal looks as if it’s months if not years away.
Finally, I think with Tesla firing up its Nevada-based Gigafactory, investors would be prudent to keep their eyes on aluminum, cobalt, nickel and especially copper, as electric vehicles use around three times as much of the red metal as conventional vehicles. Lithium, which I featured back in March, is also expected to be a beneficiary of the move to BEVs.

Investor Beware! What Does the Illinois Budget Crisis Mean for Your Bond Fund?
July 6, 2017

A recent Capital Economics (CE) report shines an unforgiving light on Illinois’ ongoing budget woes—and what it finds isn’t pretty. The crisis, which has affected every level of government in the state, is a cautionary tale for not only public spending run amok but also independent investors taking too large of a risk by seeking high yields.
The Land of Lincoln’s credit is already the lowest-rated in the union and, until recently, its debt came precariously close to being downgraded to “junk.” Were this to happen, it would become the first state ever to receive such an ignoble rating.
The state’s 10-year bond yield has soared in recent months, which might attract certain unwary speculators. It’s our belief, however, that such debt should generally be avoided, as the risks are especially high.

click to enlarge
As I write this, a state budget could possibly be successfully negotiated, making it the first time in over two years that Illinois has operated with a budget. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner already vetoed the first bill that reached his desk, which includes tax hikes, but the veto was immediately overridden by the State Senate and is now headed for the House.
No matter the outcome, the point here is that political dysfunction is unfavorable—to put it lightly—and muni investors should remain cautious.
Illinois isn’t the only state facing problems. Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin are all (or were) mired in similar budgetary impasses. New Jersey public beaches reopened just in time for July 4 celebrations after a high-profile government shutdown closed them down.
For many muni investors, navigating around these numerous pitfalls might seem overwhelming. That’s why I believe an actively-managed municipal bond fund such as our Near-Term Tax Free Fund (NEARX) could be the solution.
More than 95 percent of NEARX is invested in munis that hold between an A and AAA investment-grade rating as of March 31. What this means is we’ve historically avoided exposure to debt issued by poorly-managed municipalities.
We also like to stay on the short end of the yield curve, especially now that the Federal Reserve has begun a new interest rate cycle. When rates rise, bond prices fall, and short- and intermediate-term munis are less sensitive to rate increases than longer-term munis whose maturities are further out.
To learn more about how rates affect municipal bonds, read our whitepaper.
On the Brink of Bankruptcy
Illinois’ total debt currently stands at about $60 billion, according to Capital Economics, which is above Detroit’s $20 billion bankruptcy in 2013 and just below Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt. The state’s unfunded pensions—for teachers, professors, state employees, judges, emergency personnel and more—could be as high as $250 billion. That puts each Illinoisan on the hook for an estimated $56,000.
Political dysfunction and mismanagement are bad enough, but the state’s adverse demographics make matters even worse.
Illinois is one of only four states whose populations shrank over the past five years, the others being Connecticut, Vermont and West Virginia. CE estimates that over the next decade, the state’s population could grow only 2.2 percent, far below the national average. The number of retirees, meanwhile, could surge 34 percent.

click to enlarge
That means fewer working-age Illinoisans are expected to be counted on to support retirees in the coming years, driving up the amount of unfunded pensions even higher.
So even if the Illinois government can resolve its budget soon, we see this as only a short-term fix. The state has even larger obstacles emerging on the horizon.
Our Solution
Again, this is why I think an actively-managed muni fund like NEARX is an attractive solution. Whereas other muni funds might accumulate Illinois debt based on its high yield, regardless of risk, we generally have stuck to investment-grade munis.
It must be said that if you look at NEARX’s holdings today, you’ll see that Illinois is one of its top issuers. The bonds were purchased at an earlier time, before the state’s budgetary problems really began to worsen. We haven’t accumulated any more since it became clear to us that the risks were too great.
We continue to hold the debt because we’re confident the state’s government can successfully unravel the political gridlock and arrive at a short-term resolution. It’s the state’s long-term demographic risks that investors should especially worry about. Our longest Illinois bonds mature in 2021, and as long as the state doesn’t default in the next four years—which, in our opinion, is highly unlikely—we should get a good return on the bonds based on their yield when they were purchased.

Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Though the Near-Term Tax Free Fund seeks minimal fluctuations in share price, it is subject to the risk that the credit quality of a portfolio holding could decline, as well as risk related to changes in the economic conditions of a state, region or issuer. These risks could cause the fund’s share price to decline. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local taxes and at times the alternative minimum tax. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes.
A bond’s credit quality is determined by private independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C).
The Near-Term Tax Free Fund invests at least 80 percent of its net assets in investment-grade municipal securities. At the time of purchase for the fund's portfolio, the ratings on the bonds must be one of the four highest ratings by Moody's Investors Services (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa) or Standard & Poor's Corporation (AAA, AA, A, BBB). Credit quality designations range from high (AAA to AA) to medium (A to BBB) to low (BB, B, CCC, CC to C). In the event a bond is rated by more than one of the ratings organizations, the highest rating is shown.

 Bond funds are subject to interest-rate risk; their value declines as interest rates rise. Tax-exempt income is federal income tax free. A portion of this income may be subject to state and local income taxes, and if applicable, may subject certain investors to the Alternative Minimum Tax as well. The Near-Term Tax Free Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities that pay taxable interest. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. The tax free funds may be exposed to risks related to a concentration of investments in a particular state or geographic area. These investments present risks resulting from changes in economic conditions of the region or issuer.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Foreign and emerging market investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and less public disclosure, as well as economic and political risk. By investing in a specific geographic region, a regional fund’s returns and share price may be more volatile than those of a less concentrated portfolio.
The Emerging Europe Fund invests more than 25% of its investments in companies principally engaged in the oil & gas or banking industries. The risk of concentrating investments in this group of industries will make the fund more susceptible to risk in these industries than funds which do not concentrate their investments in an industry and may make the fund’s performance more volatile.
Because the Global Resources Fund concentrates its investments in a specific industry, the fund may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries.
 Stock markets can be volatile and share prices can fluctuate in response to sector-related and other risks as described in the fund prospectus.
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating? based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
