Brand Value in Virtual Worlds: An Axiological Approach 
By Barnes, Stuart; Mattsson, Jan

Article excerpt

ABSTRACT
Online virtual worlds, including Second Life, are rapidly becoming recognized as an important new channel for marketing and brand-building. However, the nature of the channel and its consumers or users is likely to be quite different to other channels, including the Web. Consequently, this may have knock-on effects for traditional multi-channel brand management strategies. In an effort to understand this new channel, this paper details exploratory research aimed at assessing the brand value of real-life brands that have moved to the virtual world of Second Life. Using axiology, we develop a scale to measure brand value and then assess the value of eight real-life brands in Second Life. The results demonstrate both the value of the methodology and the apparent differences in consumer perceptions of brand in the virtual world. The paper rounds off with conclusions and implications for future research and practice in this very new area.
Keywords: online game, virtual world, marketing, brand value, second life.
1. Introduction
Online virtual worlds have become heralded as a technology of substantial future importance for marketers [Hemp 2006]. A 'virtual world' is defined as a three-dimensional, computer-generated environment that appears similar to our 'real' world, often massively multi-user and connected to the Internet, and developed to supply online entertainment and social networking for users. In our definition, virtual worlds are open-ended virtual interaction platforms or 'experience worlds'; thus, goals are not prescribed, and virtual worlds are not games in the traditional sense. For example, game-oriented environments, such as World of Warcraft, Sims Online and Everquest would be excluded from our definition. Current virtual worlds have become highly interactive, collaborative and commercial; these worlds have the potential to be new channels for marketing content and products, integrating 'v-commerce', or virtual e-commerce.
The best known virtual world is Second Life, which has grown rapidly from 2 million residents in January 2006 to more than 9 million residents in August 2007. Some 1.3 million people ran the official software and logged-in to Second Life in March 2007, an increase of 46 percent in the number of active residents from January 2007 [ComScore 2007]. In March 2007, 61 percent of active Second Life residents were from Europe (16 percent from Germany), compared to 19 percent from North America, and 13 percent from the Asia Pacific. In addition, 61 percent of residents were male while 39 percent were female [ComScore 2007].
Many of these virtual worlds have a firm basis for commercial development, including an in-world currency, customization of avatars and objects, concepts of property ownership, text and/or voice communication and many different marketplaces and communities [Castranova 2005; Good 2007; Manninen and Kujanpää 2007]. Virtual worlds provide extraordinarily flexibility and potential for brand-building. Tools for promotion include, for example, product placement of 3-D objects (similar to product brands, like beverages, as seen in films), real-world analogs (such as billboards and radio), advergames (mini-games or mini-worlds, with some element of advertising), and cross-promotion (such as coupons, dancing or camping in SL) [Vedrashko 2006].
The significance of brands in virtual worlds, such as Second Life, is already apparent. This virtual world, which has more than 13 million residents (as of May 2008), has more than 100 real life brands [KZero 2007a, New Business Horizons 2007], including those in sectors such as auto (e.g., Mercedes, Mazda and Pontiac), media (e.g., AOL, Reuters and Sony BMG), travel (e.g., STA Travel), consumer electronics (e.g., Intel, Dell, Nokia and Sony Ericsson), consumer goods (e.g. Reebok and American Apparel), telecommunications (e.g. Vodafone and Telus), finance (e.g. ABN Amro and ING) and professional services (e. …

Naming your product

The Web App Challenge | February 4th, 2013                        

Naming is probably my least favorite part of the product creation process. I feel like I spend days or weeks just going in circles, coming up with nothing good. It is a painful cycle of thinking up names then checking the domain registry, only to find the .com is taken. It sucks. Though now I have a bit of a process so that I can at least come up with a few decent options in not too long.
To start, I have a few rules this name has to meet:

The domain name must be a .com
The name should be two words at most
The name should be three syllables at most
Can be clearly heard over the phone
Should not be easily confused with another word or name

I always start by writing down a list of words that describe or relate to the product in some way. Here’s a sample of the words that I wrote down for this project:

Plan
Email
Mail
Send
Convert
Course
Trust
…

There were more, but you get the idea.
Then I plug these words one-by-one into LeanDomainSearch.com (which is a god-send for this process). Basic Lean Domain Search takes your word and combines it with other common words, then returns the combinations that have the .com available. This will leave you with a  name along the lines of these popular startups:

SendGrid
Dropbox
MailChimp
Facebook
MailGun

As you can see it has worked well for them. Other than being just two words, what do all those have in common? They are just two syllables. It turns out finding short words that have some meaning is quite difficult. Though every time I found a combination that might work, I wrote it down. Often a word would turn up that sounded good, so I would go back and try pairing it with words on my previous list.
For one off searches I used Moniker. Only because I hear they don’t snag your domain names if you don’t purchase them. Something GoDaddy and NetworkSolutions have been accused of doing.
A rough list
Here is the rough list of .com names I made:

ConvertLater
Helloify
HelloTrust
HelloConvert
ConvertPost
ReconMail
HelloDispatch
HelloCarrot
SendConvert
CoreConvert
SnapConvert
ConvertKit
BoldKit
NanoSend
BoldSend
SendVision
SendFocus
CraftBold
MailVert
HelloPath
InkTrust
PathInk


TrustLegend
SendLegend
LegendKit
OnLegend
InkConvert
LegendPath
GetInkable.com

Another option with names is to go with something short, but memorable, then add something to the domain in order to get a .com. Classic examples are:

BasecampHQ.com
LetsFreckle.com
TheFacebook.com
GetDropbox.com

And many more. The problem I have with this approach is that people tend to add the extra word into your company name. For example, my company is called Legend, but the domain name is ThinkLegend.com. Unfortunately everyone thinks my company name is Think Legend. Which is really frustrating.
So I wanted the product name to be an exact match to the .com domain name. So that brought me back to my list above.
Other Opinions
I picked out a few of my favorites, then asked a few trusted friends for their opinion. I didn’t share anything about my choices with them (to make sure to not bias them). Here are a few of the comments that came back:
“Don’t like ‘hello’ at all.”
“ConvertLater is a bad idea. Sounds negative.”
“SnapConvert is good.”
“ConvertKit is good.”
ConvertKit was already my favorite out of the group, so it was nice to hear the validation. I decided against SnapConvert because I don’t like the way it sounds, but more importantly because “snap” sounds instant, which is the opposite of the conversion process I advocate.
So with that, ConvertKit became the official name and I breathed a sigh of relief. I quickly registered the domain and started to use it in the project.
I hope my experience helps you choose a name for your product.
Weekly Review
I’ve fallen behind slightly with my weekly reviews, so I’m going to give you two weeks now. Development is still moving along great. I actually will start sending public traffic to the ConvertKit landing pages in a few days. That’s serious progress!
January 20th – 26th

Design: 3 hours
Planning: 1 hour
Marketing 2 hours (this was working on the sales page)

Total: 6 hours. Remember that week I worked more than my allotted 20 hours? Well, I’m making up for it here. I’ve been on vacation in Costa Rica the last couple weeks, so that’s why the hours are so low.
January 27th – February 2nd

Design: 3 hours
Development: 5 hours
Marketing: 5 hours

Another vacation week, but I managed to fit in a total of 13 hours worth of work. That included everything necessary to get ConvertKit.com up and running.
As always, if you want to follow along by email, sign up below. Have a great week!

Awesome article Nathan. I didn’t know about leandomainsearch.com! I used http://wordoid.com/ to find a name for my product :)

Great post. Coming up with a name is always a hard thing to do. leandomainsearch.com seems like a good website as well, thanks for the tip.

Hey Nathan I like your process for finding a name it’s pretty practical! Also think convertkit is a solid name good job. I know alot of your names were pretty straight forward and to the point. Do you prefer that approach? What do you think of names that try to get to the essence of the brand but not quite so specific as literal key terms? 
For example for your idea, why did you pick convertkit over something like unguard or something else that conveys the reward in a more ambiguous way? Do you think they both have benefits?

Nathan,
Thank you for sharing, this is really helpful. I wanted to ask you about the pricing strategy. How did you come up with the $ amount for the three plans on convertkit.com ? Can you please elaborate the thought process?
Did you interview your future customers to understand how much they were willing to pay for such service?

Nathan,
First off I want to say I love your blog, and this is one of the few posts that I don’t agree with. 
I appreciate the post, and I think the resources you listed can be useful, but to me this is probably the wrong way to go about picking a name. I can’t say I’m an expert, but I can say that every time I’ve been trying to decide on a name, and I use the same method as you, I get the same results. I waste tons and tons of time, and get generic results. 
A better way is to think about the naming process in three steps.
1. What is the core function/action of my business ?
i.e.
Email
Send
Chat
Store
Etc. 
2. Is there a way you want to describe that action?
Quick
Fast
Robust
Volume
Secure
Agile
3. Are there other ways to describe the actions that are shorter, and easier to remember?
(sometimes these are onomonopia)
I.e.
Snap (quick)
Zip/Zing (fast)
Box (robust)
Stack (volume)
Lock (secure)
Can’t think of one but you get the idea! (Agile)
4. Can you combine the words to make a cool sounding name that describes your business?
Say SnapSend or ChatBox. Etc. 
5. Are there other types of names that might work? Maybe you can think of a clever 5 letter word that hasn’t been taken yet. Or try removing vowels, or adding suffixes like “ly” or “it” or “er” 
All the best,
Alex

What about the Tim Ferriss method where you run a ~$50 adword campaign and see which URL drives the highest conversion for your copy? 
I guess my personal preference is to let the market dictate the URL, unless I have a specific goal in mind for the domain, such as branding.

Two questions, Nathan:
1. What goals does this naming procedure help to achieve? Some companies are trying to build a brand; others are more interested in search engine and other “visibility”.
2. Do you have any science that backs this naming procedure as achieving the goals?
Descriptive words seem to drive the entire process. Yet some of the most respected marketing experts in the world recommend using names that AREN’T descriptive (if you’re trying to build a brand). And the science I’ve seen backs them up:
Heckler, S. E. and Childers, J. L., “The Role of Expectancy and Relevancy in Memory for Verbal and Visual Information: What Is Incongruency?” Journal of Consumer Research, 18, 3, 475-492, 1992.
Miller, Elizabeth G. and Kahn, Barbara E. Shades of Meaning: The Effect of Color and Flavor Names on Consumer Choice. Journal of Consumer Research. June 2005.

Nathan Barry says:

        August 19, 2014



The idea is to come up with a simple memorable name where the .com is available. It’s not based in science, just simple theory.
The goal is to find a name that is available, and it works really well for that.

Roger L. Cauvin says:

        January 28, 2015



If you check out the first two articles, you’ll find they show that descriptive names tend to be less memorable. Thus “writing down a list of words that describe or relate to the product in some way” may work against the goal of coming up with a memorable name. The science matters!

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
