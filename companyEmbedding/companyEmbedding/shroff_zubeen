Maria Fareri Children’s Hospital

                    The Maria Fareri Children's Hospital at Westchester Medical Center is a vision shared by many people, including Brenda and John Fareri, who lost their 13-year-old daughter, Maria, to rabies in 1995. During the time that Maria was hospitalized at Westchester Medical Center, Brenda and John quickly realized that Westchester Medical Center, like many hospitals, was built at a time when families were not considered an important part of a patient's care.

The Maria Fareri Children's Hospital is the only hospital in the nation named after a child. After Maria died, her parents, John and Brenda Fareri, learned that Maria had made a special wish as part of a school project - "for the health and well-being of all the children in the world." With her spirit guiding them, her parents, family and other 20,000 members of our community have made this wish a reality. Today, Maria Fareri Children's Hospital is a place where parents are not visitors but partners with the staff in the care of their children.
