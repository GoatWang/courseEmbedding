What our clients are saying


"I want to thank everyone at Cryoport who was involved in the rapid recovery of the missing Cryoport shipper containing a patient’s tumor tissue. By promptly locating the shipper and recharging it while in transit, the patient was able to receive the vaccine manufactured from this tissue on time. We are so very appreciative of Cryoport’s customer service. Without the services that Cryoport provides, our clinical trials would not be available to patients."
Director of Clinical Operations — Cryoport Customer


“Cryoport does an amazing job of handling the shipping and logistics for transporting cryopreserved materials. We have switched to them for all of our exports.”
Bioengineering Core Employee – Cryoport Customer 


“I contacted Cryoport to transport stem cells from Denver, Colorado, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the service provided was excellent. It was a hassle-free transport. I was especially impressed with the continuous communication throughout the transport and particularly appreciated the fact that not only did my shipment arrive in good condition, but Cryoport also made all of the arrangements for the return of the shipper so that I didn’t have to. Our facility will definitely use Cryoport’s service in the future and would recommend it to others.”
Stem Cell Transplant Coordinator – Cryoport Customer


“As a customer I'm very pleased with the service I received from Cryoport. Cryoport’s team always answered my questions, provided help in a professional manner and were extremely attentive.”
Cryoport Customer


“Had I known how great Cryoport’s dry vapor shipper and logistics system worked, we would have used Cryoport for all our previous shipments to the U.S. In the past we have used dry ice and several times we lost valuable cells because our shipments would sit in customs forever and the dry ice would evaporate. Cryoport eliminated that concern altogether. I will certainly be utilizing Cryoport’s services for future shipments.”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer


“By using Cryoport I experienced much less stress as my shipment went through customs!”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer


“I called Cryoport after hours for information about a shipment I needed to schedule and received absolutely outstanding customer service. Cryoport provided me with a lot of helpful information and great advice. It's rare and refreshing to receive such great service.”
Cryoport Customer


“Not only did my cells arrive safely, Cryoport’s service was professional and efficient. I highly recommend Cryoport.” 
Hematologist – Cryoport Customer


“Working with Cryoport was a truly remarkable difference compared to my experience with other shippers. With the previous shipping company I was working with, it took almost three months to establish a ‘deep frozen account’ and required numerous hoop-jumping shenanigans only to ultimately be informed that the company could not arrange a shipment to or from Israel, which they were informed from the start was our desired shipping source.

Our sales rep at this organization was as dumbfounded by our experience as we were. To his credit, after his company declined our business, he suggested I contact Cryoport. I have written thanking him for his suggestion and to let his ‘powers-that-be’ know how different my experiences were.”
Cryoport Biopharma Customer


“When compared to other shippers, I am highly satisfied with Cryoport’s pricing and service.”
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer


“Our organization is more than impressed by our experience with Cryoport. We feel confident our material is being well-managed throughout transit. Cryoport provides extraordinary customer service and continuously they not only meet, but exceed our expectations. Late yesterday afternoon Cryoport worked tirelessly to coordinate a shipment to Japan and today seemed to effortlessly manage a late-day return. It is a pleasure working with Cryoport.”
Senior Supply Chain Analyst – Cryoport Customer


“Cryoport’s service is easy, straightforward and very convenient. We used to run into issues with transporting specimens to outside labs and Cryoport has eliminated this hurdle. Knowing Cryoport has it handled helps me sleep at night.”
Professor of Anatomy, Histology and Cell Biology – Cryoport Customer


“I'd like to commend Cryoport for their fantastic service. Our collaborator was also similarly impressed and will be recommending Cryoport to her colleagues. In addition to the great service and quality product, Cryoport’s pricing is second to none. We look forward to working with Cryoport for all of our future temperature-sensitive shipments."
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer


“Cryoport provides a reliable solution to ship temperature-sensitive biologics around the world. The Cryoport solution is easy for scientists to use. They respond quickly, have great customer service and anticipate problems. I am able to speak to someone 24/7 who is an expert on MY package. It is personal service focused on deep frozen life sciences. I consider Cryoport to be an extended member of my team.”
Product Operations Specialist – Cryoport Customer

Steadfast ProtectionPowered by industry-leading technology and expert support


















Cryoport Express®
For materials that need to be kept at frozen temperatures, Cryoport’s signature Cryoport Express® dry vapor dewars are the most advanced storage and shipping containers on the market today minimizing the risks of temperature excursions.
With a wide variety of shipper types and sizes, Cryoport offers a truly flexible cold chain logistics solution. Whether you need to transport or store a single vial or an entire lab’s worth of samples, Cryoport is capable of meeting any of your cold chain logistics needs.
The technology within
Our lightweight and reusable shipping containers feature a combination of advanced packaging, cryogenics and high-vacuum technology. Dewars are composed of aircraft-grade aluminum protecting an inner holding chamber. The inner chamber is surrounded by a high-surface, low-density open cell plastic foam that allows for hold times of up to 10 days. This design ensures that the liquid nitrogen remains within the foam and that the specimen cylinder stays dry, regardless of the dewar’s orientation. Finally, as an added measure, the dewar is then wrapped in insulating and cushioning materials and placed in a recyclable cardboard package for shipment.
The Cryoport Express® dewar is truly more than just a container, it is a scientifically engineered logistics tool built to ensure that even the most temperature-sensitive materials can be shipped and stored safely.
 

 
Cryoport Express® Accessories
Cryoport offers a variety of accessories to make your shipping process as simple as possible.

Cryovials used for storing biological materials at cryogenic temperatures.
Cryoboxes used for storage and shipment of cryovials. These can be shipped flat in the box with the dewar and assembled on site.
Canes that hold cryovials in liquid nitrogen containers.
Tyvek® bags that are used to contain infectious substances and pass IATA testing for class 6.2 substances.

What our clients are saying


"I want to thank everyone at Cryoport who was involved in the rapid recovery of the missing Cryoport shipper containing a patient’s tumor tissue. By promptly locating the shipper and recharging it while in transit, the patient was able to receive the vaccine manufactured from this tissue on time. We are so very appreciative of Cryoport’s customer service. Without the services that Cryoport provides, our clinical trials would not be available to patients."
Director of Clinical Operations — Cryoport Customer


“Cryoport does an amazing job of handling the shipping and logistics for transporting cryopreserved materials. We have switched to them for all of our exports.”
Bioengineering Core Employee – Cryoport Customer 


“I contacted Cryoport to transport stem cells from Denver, Colorado, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the service provided was excellent. It was a hassle-free transport. I was especially impressed with the continuous communication throughout the transport and particularly appreciated the fact that not only did my shipment arrive in good condition, but Cryoport also made all of the arrangements for the return of the shipper so that I didn’t have to. Our facility will definitely use Cryoport’s service in the future and would recommend it to others.”
Stem Cell Transplant Coordinator – Cryoport Customer


“As a customer I'm very pleased with the service I received from Cryoport. Cryoport’s team always answered my questions, provided help in a professional manner and were extremely attentive.”
Cryoport Customer


“Had I known how great Cryoport’s dry vapor shipper and logistics system worked, we would have used Cryoport for all our previous shipments to the U.S. In the past we have used dry ice and several times we lost valuable cells because our shipments would sit in customs forever and the dry ice would evaporate. Cryoport eliminated that concern altogether. I will certainly be utilizing Cryoport’s services for future shipments.”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer


“By using Cryoport I experienced much less stress as my shipment went through customs!”
Principal Investigator – Cryoport Customer


“I called Cryoport after hours for information about a shipment I needed to schedule and received absolutely outstanding customer service. Cryoport provided me with a lot of helpful information and great advice. It's rare and refreshing to receive such great service.”
Cryoport Customer


“Not only did my cells arrive safely, Cryoport’s service was professional and efficient. I highly recommend Cryoport.” 
Hematologist – Cryoport Customer


“Working with Cryoport was a truly remarkable difference compared to my experience with other shippers. With the previous shipping company I was working with, it took almost three months to establish a ‘deep frozen account’ and required numerous hoop-jumping shenanigans only to ultimately be informed that the company could not arrange a shipment to or from Israel, which they were informed from the start was our desired shipping source.

Our sales rep at this organization was as dumbfounded by our experience as we were. To his credit, after his company declined our business, he suggested I contact Cryoport. I have written thanking him for his suggestion and to let his ‘powers-that-be’ know how different my experiences were.”
Cryoport Biopharma Customer


“When compared to other shippers, I am highly satisfied with Cryoport’s pricing and service.”
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer


“Our organization is more than impressed by our experience with Cryoport. We feel confident our material is being well-managed throughout transit. Cryoport provides extraordinary customer service and continuously they not only meet, but exceed our expectations. Late yesterday afternoon Cryoport worked tirelessly to coordinate a shipment to Japan and today seemed to effortlessly manage a late-day return. It is a pleasure working with Cryoport.”
Senior Supply Chain Analyst – Cryoport Customer


“Cryoport’s service is easy, straightforward and very convenient. We used to run into issues with transporting specimens to outside labs and Cryoport has eliminated this hurdle. Knowing Cryoport has it handled helps me sleep at night.”
Professor of Anatomy, Histology and Cell Biology – Cryoport Customer


“I'd like to commend Cryoport for their fantastic service. Our collaborator was also similarly impressed and will be recommending Cryoport to her colleagues. In addition to the great service and quality product, Cryoport’s pricing is second to none. We look forward to working with Cryoport for all of our future temperature-sensitive shipments."
Lab Manager – Cryoport Customer


“Cryoport provides a reliable solution to ship temperature-sensitive biologics around the world. The Cryoport solution is easy for scientists to use. They respond quickly, have great customer service and anticipate problems. I am able to speak to someone 24/7 who is an expert on MY package. It is personal service focused on deep frozen life sciences. I consider Cryoport to be an extended member of my team.”
Product Operations Specialist – Cryoport Customer

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Cryoport, Inc. (Cryoport), incorporated on May 25, 1990, is a provider of cryogenic logistics solutions to the life sciences industry through its purpose-built packaging, information technology and specialized cold chain logistics expertise. The Company provides logistics solutions for biologic materials, such as immunotherapies, stem cells, chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)-T cells, and reproductive cells for clients. The Company's clients include companies and institutions that require cryogenic logistics solutions, such as therapy developers for personalized medicine, bio-pharmaceuticals, research, contract research organizations, diagnostic laboratories, contract manufacturers, cord blood repositories, vaccine manufacturers, animal husbandry related companies and in-vitro fertilization clinics.The Company's Cryoport Express Solution includes a cloud-based logistics operating platform, which is branded as the Cryoportal. The Cryoportal supports the management of the entire shipment and logistics process through a single interface, including initial order input, document preparation, customs clearance, courier management, shipment tracking, issue resolution and delivery. In addition, it provides incisive information dashboards and validation documentation for every shipment. The Cryoportal records and retains a fully documented chain-of-custody and, at the client's option, chain-of-condition for every shipment. The branded packaging for the Company's Cryoport Express Solutions includes its liquid nitrogen dry vapor shippers, the Cryoport Express Shippers. The Cryoport Express Shippers are reusable cryogenic transport containers utilizing an application of dry vapor liquid nitrogen (LN2) technology. The Company's Cryoport Express Shippers include the Standard Dry Shipper, the High Volume Dry Shipper and the Cryoport Express CXVC1 Shipper.The Company's solution can be accessed directly through its cloud-based Cryoportal or by contacting Cryoport Client Care for order entry. Cryoport arranges for the pick-up of the parcel by a shipping service provider, which is designated by the client or chosen by Cryoport, for delivery to the client's intended recipient. When the Cryoport Operations Center receives the Cryoport Express Shipper, it is cleaned, put through quality assurance testing and returned to inventory for reuse. In addition to the Company's standard turn-key solution, the Company also provides the customer facing solutions, which include Customer staged Solution, designed for clients making over 50 shipments per month; Customer Managed Solution, a customer implemented solution, whereby it supplies the Cryoport Express Shippers to clients in a fully charged state; powered by Cryoport, available to providers of shipping and delivery services, who seek to offer a branded cryogenic logistics solution as part of their service offerings; Integrated Solution, which is its total outsource solution, and Regenerative Medicine Point-of-Care Repository Solution, designed for autologous therapies.Cryoport Express SolutionsThe Company's Cryoport Express Solutions are made up of the Cryoportal software platform, Cryoport Express Shippers, Cryoport Express Smart Pak data loggers and its life sciences cold chain logistics expertise. The Cryoportal programmatically assists in the management of all aspects of the logistics operations beginning with order entry and continuing to monitor, log data, track shipments and store information. The Cryoportal is capable of producing a range of Cryoport Express Analytics, which report shipment performance metrics, and evaluates temperature-monitoring and other data collected by the Cryoport Express SmartPak during shipment.Cryoport Express Solutions are focused on improving the reliability of cryogenic logistics. The Company provides end-to-end solutions for cryogenic logistics requirements, including management, transport, monitoring and data collection regarding frozen and cryogenically preserved biological commodities or pharmaceutical materials shipped primarily though integrators and Cryoport's logistics network, which includes specialty couriers, brokers and other intermediaries.CryoportalThe Cryoportal is used by the Company, its clients and its business partners to automate the entry of orders, prepare customs documentation, and to facilitate status and location monitoring of shipped orders while in transit. It is used by Cryoport to assist in managing logistics operations. Cryoportal has features, including automation of order entry, and programmatic exception monitoring to detect and anticipate delays in the shipping process.The Cryoportal serves as the communications center for the management, collection and analysis of SmartPak data collected from SmartPak condition monitoring system in the field. Data is converted into pre-designed reports containing information, which can be utilized by Cryoport to provide feedback to its clients relating to their shipments. The Cryoportal is used for time- and temperature-sensitive shipments that are required to be maintained at specific temperatures, such as ambient (between 20 degrees and 25 degrees celsius), chilled (between 2 degrees and 8 degrees celsius) or frozen (minus 10 degrees celsius or less down to cryogenic temperatures minus 150 degrees celsius).The Cryoport Express ShippersThe Company's Cryoport Express Shippers are cryogenic dry vapor shippers capable of maintaining cryogenic temperatures for a shipping period of over 10 days. Its Cryoport Express Shippers ensures that there is no pressure build up as the liquid nitrogen evaporates. It offers a retention system to ensure that liquid nitrogen stays inside the vacuum container, which allows the shipper to be designated as a dry vapor shipper. Specimens that may be transported using its cryogenic shipper include live cells, scientific or pharmaceutical commodities, such as cancer vaccines, diagnostic materials, semen, eggs, embryos, infectious substances, and other commodities that require continuous exposure to frozen or cryogenic temperatures.The Company offers approximately three sizes of dry vapor shippers, which include the Cryoport Express Standard Shipper, the Cryoport Express High Volume Shipper and the Cryoport Express CXVC1 Shipper. The Company's Cryoport Express Shippers consists of an aluminum (aircraft-grade) dewar flask, containing a well for holding the high value biological or other materials in its inner chamber and retention foam that absorbs the liquid nitrogen placed in the shipper to provide it with its cold temperature.Cryoport Express Standard ShippersThe Cryoport Express Standard Shippers are re-usable dry vapor liquid nitrogen storage containers. The Cryoport Express Standard Shipper is composed of an aluminum metallic dewar flask, with a well for holding the biological material in the inner chamber.Cryoport Express High Volume ShippersThe Cryoport Express High Volume Shipper uses a dry vapor LN2 technology to maintain minus temperatures with a shipping endurance of approximately 10 days. The Cryoport Express High Volume Shipper is based on the same dry vapor technology as Cryoport's original standard dry shipper and utilizes an absorbent material to hold LN2.Cryoport Express CXVC1 ShippersThe Cryoport Express CXVC1 Shipper is a shipper and can be used either as a dry vapor shipper or a liquid shipper. It is designed to focus on vaccine ampoules or cryovial shipments in canisters. The Cryoport Express CXVC1 Shipper is reusable and recyclable for transporting life science materials.Cryoport Express Shipper SummaryThe Cryoport Express Solutions are solutions available in the biotechnology and life sciences markets. It is engaged in the shipment of time- and temperature-critical, frozen and refrigerated transport of biological materials, such as stem cells, cell lines, pharmaceutical clinical trial samples, gene biotechnology, infectious materials handling, animal and human reproduction markets.The Cryoport Express Smart Pak Temperature Monitoring SystemThe Company's Smart Pak System consists of a self-contained automated data logger and thermocouple capable of recording cryogenic temperatures of samples shipped in its Cryoport Express Shippers. The data-logging temperature probe is positioned within the shipper to record the accurate reading. The resultant temperature mapping includes both the temperature inside the chamber (which is closest to the actual biomaterial) and the external temperature.Chain-of-ConditionThe Company's Chain-of-Condition information is essential for various life sciences materials. Monitoring starts with its custom-built condition monitoring systems, which include the Cryoport Express SmartPak I and II. The Cryoport Express SmartPak provides data on the condition of the shipper and material shipped, which is critical for temperature-sensitive biologics. The Cryoportal acts as the data repository for all shipment and condition information, which the customer can access through the Internet.Chain-of-CustodyWhen overlaid with the carrier check-ins, the data monitor and analysis also provides a chain-of-custody. The report from the data monitor serves as analysis for temperature monitoring of the entire shipment, as well as a tampering warning. The report identifies outlier temperature excursions, such as opening the shipment in customs or tampering.Cryoport Express AnalyticsCryoport Express Analytics information is captured by the Cryoportal to provide the Company and its customers access to information from the shipments recorded in the Cryoportal to assist in the management of its customers' shipping. The analytical results are utilized by Cryoport to render consultative client services.Biological Material HoldersA containment bag is used in connection with the shipment of infectious or dangerous goods using the Cryoport Express Shippers. Approximately 70 cryovials, which include polypropylene vials with high-density polyethylene closures, set on aluminum canes, are placed into an absorbent pouch, which is designed to contain the entire contents of all the vials in the event of leakage. This pouch is then placed in a watertight Tyvek bag (secondary packaging) capable of withstanding cryogenic temperatures, and then sealed. This bag is then placed into the well of the Cryoport Express Shipper.Logistics Expertise, Consulting and SupportThe Company offers Temperature Controlled Logistics Consulting Division to assist life sciences companies in developing strategies for global cold chain logistics management and contingency options to protect their biological commodities. The Temperature Controlled Logistics Consulting Division focuses on the demand created by the advances in cellular-based therapies, including immunotherapies, stem cells and CAR T-cells.The Company competes with Insulated Shipping Containers, Inc., Tegrant, MVE/Chart Industries, Taylor Wharton, Air Liquide, Industrial Insulation Systems, Marathon Products Inc., Kodiak Thermal Technologies, Inc., BioMatrica, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
