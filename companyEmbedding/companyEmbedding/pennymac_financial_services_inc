PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. is a specialty financial services 
                firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business 
                focused on the production and servicing of U.S. mortgage loans and 
                the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market.
PennyMac Financial was founded in 2008 by members of our executive 
                leadership team and two strategic partners, BlackRock Mortgage Ventures, 
                LLC and HC Partners, LLC, formerly known as Highfields Capital Investments, 
                LLC. Since then, we have built what we believe is an industry-leading 
                operational platform to pursue business opportunities in the U.S. 
                mortgage market. We have a strong track record of performance and 
                earnings growth, driven by solid execution of our growth strategies 
                while remaining focused on quality and governance.
PennyMac Financial operates in three business segments: Loan 
                Production, Loan Servicing and Investment Management. As of 
                December 31, 2016, we are the 4th largest originator and the 11th largest 
                servicer in the U.S. according to Inside Mortgage Finance. In our 
                Investment Management business, we manage private investment funds 
                and PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT), a publicly-traded 
                mortgage REIT. PMT is a tax-efficient vehicle for investing in 
                mortgage-related assets and a capital partner that helps reduce 
                our balance sheet requirements compared to a typical mortgage company.
We believe that PennyMac Financial is a unique company in the 
                U.S. mortgage sector. We have a diversified business model that 
                includes complementary strategies that have generated strong and 
                growing profits across a range of market environments. We believe 
                that the deep experience of our senior management and our strong 
                commitment to corporate governance, compliance, and risk management 
                are essential to PennyMac Financial's continued success and long-term 
                growth.

Forward-Looking Statements 



This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, regarding management’s beliefs, estimates, projections and assumptions with respect to, among other things, the Company’s financial results, future operations, business plans and investment strategies, as well as industry and market conditions, all of which are subject to change.  Words like “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “promise,” “plan,” and other expressions or words of similar meanings, as well as future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may” are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Actual results and operations for any future period may vary materially from those projected herein, from past results discussed herein.
Factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include, but are not limited to: the continually changing federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable to the highly regulated industry in which we operate; lawsuits or governmental actions that may result from any noncompliance with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses; the mortgage lending and servicing-related regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  and its enforcement of these regulations; our dependence on U.S. government-sponsored entities and changes in their current roles or their guarantees or guidelines; changes to government mortgage modification programs; the licensing and operational requirements of states and other jurisdictions applicable to the Company’s businesses, to which our bank competitors are not subject; foreclosure delays and changes in foreclosure practices; certain banking regulations that may limit our business activities; our dependence on the multifamily and commercial real estate sectors for future originations of commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate related loans; changes in macroeconomic and U.S. real estate market conditions; difficulties inherent in growing loan production volume; difficulties inherent in adjusting the size of our operations to reflect changes in business levels; purchase opportunities for mortgage servicing rights and our success in winning bids; changes in prevailing interest rates; increases in loan delinquencies and defaults; our reliance on PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT) as a significant source of financing for, and revenue related to, our mortgage banking business; any required additional capital and liquidity to support business growth that may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all; our obligation to indemnify third-party purchasers or repurchase loans if loans that we originate, acquire, service or assist in the fulfillment of, fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances; our obligation to indemnify PMT and the Investment Funds if its services fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances; decreases in the returns on the assets that we select and manage for our clients, and our resulting management and incentive fees; the extensive amount of regulation applicable to our investment management segment; conflicts of interest in allocating our services and investment opportunities among us and our advised entities; the effect of public opinion on our reputation; our recent growth; our ability to effectively identify, manage, monitor and mitigate financial risks; our initiation of new business activities or expansion of existing business activities; our ability to detect misconduct and fraud; and our ability to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents.
You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider all of the uncertainties and risks described above, as well as those more fully discussed in reports and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, and the statements made in this presentation are current as of the date of this presentation only.

Why PennyMac?










We service the loans we originate — Unlike most lenders, we stay committed to our customers throughout the life of the loan. When you originate a loan with PennyMac, we’ll service your loan because we value your trust and decision to choose us.







No expensive brick-and-mortar retail offices — We believe in passing on the savings to our customers with low, competitive rates and fees available today.







A full range of loan products and beneficial services —  PennyMac’s Pre-qualification Certificate, for example, helps you understand how much you can afford before you start shopping. Your offer will stand out, and because you've put some of the paperwork behind you, your loan can close more quickly.













My loan officer worked very hard to ensure that our house refinance loan was processed in a short window of time so that it would be completed before our scheduled trip out of the country.

I like to thank Carlos Robles and Richard Kennimer. They were both very helpful and I greatly appreciated their assistance throughout the process. They made it easy to process the loan and hand in the required paperwork. The document upload process was simplified using the PennyMac secure website with my own personal account.

Our Mission
As a top national mortgage lender, PennyMac is committed to providing its customers with a range of innovative solutions to help them purchase, refinance or simply remain in their homes. Whether they’re new to the home loan process or experienced buyers specifically seeking a competitive conventional, FHA or VA loan, PennyMac is dedicated to offering competitive rates and superior service.
Being a direct mortgage lender means PennyMac can focus on the needs of its customers rather than maintaining a network of branches and banking products. The company’s licensed loan officers are trained to help customers through the process every step of the way.
Since its founding in 2008, PennyMac has sought to restore Americans’ trust in home ownership by improving the quality and consistency of the mortgage lending experience.
The company offers multiple options to help prospective customers buy, refinance or simply stay in their homes.  PennyMac has participated in the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), federal programs created in 2009 to help customers in need of financial assistance remain in their homes. PennyMac also buys loans from banks and other lenders, using its expertise to help customers restructure their mortgages so they can stay in their homes. As a major loan servicer, the company also supports more than 1,000,000 PennyMac home loan customers.

Style Scores:



A Value | C Growth | F Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. Announces $50 Million Stock Repurchase Program






Business Wire




Jun 21, 2017 4:30 PM EDT













 


















































  PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE: PFSI) (the "Company") today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding Class A common stock.  "We believe that the repurchase of common stock will enhance value for our stockholders," said Executive Chairman Stanford L. Kurland. "PennyMac has repeatedly generated after-tax returns on equity that compare favorably, on a risk-adjusted basis, to other investment opportunities available to us. Our strong capital position enables us to deploy capital in stock repurchases alongside our mortgage banking activities and potential MSR acquisitions."  The repurchase program allows the Company to repurchase its Class A common stock using open market stock purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, stock price, trading volume and general market conditions, along with working capital requirements, general business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of Class A common stock. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time at the Company's discretion without prior notice. The Company intends to finance the stock repurchase program through cash on hand.  About PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.

Why PennyMac?










We service the loans we originate — Unlike most lenders, we stay committed to our customers throughout the life of the loan. When you originate a loan with PennyMac, we’ll service your loan because we value your trust and decision to choose us.







No expensive brick-and-mortar retail offices — We believe in passing on the savings to our customers with low, competitive rates and fees available today.







A full range of loan products and beneficial services —  PennyMac’s Pre-qualification Certificate, for example, helps you understand how much you can afford before you start shopping. Your offer will stand out, and because you've put some of the paperwork behind you, your loan can close more quickly.













My loan officer worked very hard to ensure that our house refinance loan was processed in a short window of time so that it would be completed before our scheduled trip out of the country.

I like to thank Carlos Robles and Richard Kennimer. They were both very helpful and I greatly appreciated their assistance throughout the process. They made it easy to process the loan and hand in the required paperwork. The document upload process was simplified using the PennyMac secure website with my own personal account.
