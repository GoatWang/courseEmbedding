Mutual Fund Arrangements



Like many securities firms, RBC CM receives payments from fund companies. RBC CM uses this money for general marketing and Financial Advisor educational programs, to offset compliance and product management costs, and to support client education programs and seminars. In return for the payments, fund companies are given access to our branch offices for the purpose of educating our Financial Advisors and informing them about available products. Our Financial Advisors do not receive any extra commission for selling funds from these companies. Each Financial Advisor individually evaluates the funds and then works with you to choose the appropriate investment for your financial needs. 
The fund companies generally make these payments, which may be based on assets and/or sales volume, to RBC CM via the fund’s distributor, investment advisor, or other entity from the management fees they earn. More information on payments may be found in a fund’s prospectus or Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Financial Advisors may receive a portion of these payments for distribution and servicing expenses related to shares of money market funds included as sweep options to cash accounts. The payment formula is consistent for Financial Advisors on all of these funds. 
The following list represents the fund companies making asset and/or sales-based financial payments to RBC CM, in order of financial contribution, from January 1, 2016, to October 31, 2016: RBC, Federated, American Funds, Franklin Templeton, Blackrock, Thornburg, Oppenheimer, Fidelity Advisors, JP Morgan Funds, Ivy Funds, Russell Fund Distributors, Lord Abbett, Hartford, Invesco, Putnam, Henderson Funds, Wells Fargo Funds, Deutsche, Pioneer, Alliancebernstein, PIMCO, Goldman Sachs, IVA Funds, Columbia Threadneedle, John Hancock, Doubleline Funds, Principal Funds, Voya, Dreyfus, Prudential, Allianz, Delaware, SunAmerica, First Eagle, Touchstone, Mainstay, First Trust, Gabelli, Lazard Funds, Nuveen, Calamos Funds, Guggenheim, Alger, Vanguard, AMG Funds, Wasatch, Natixis, Janus, Tocqueville, Sentinel Funds, Eagle Funds, AQR Funds, Alps, MFS, Harding Loevner Funds, American Beacon, Locorr Funds, RS Funds, Cohen & Steers, Legg Mason, Davis Funds, Cullen Funds, Baron, Transamerica, Matthews International, Weitz Investments, Buffalo Funds, Artisan Funds, Victory Capital, Neuberger & Berman, PNC Funds, Swan, Catalyst, Calvert Investments, Van Eck, Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley, Stringer, Highland Funds, Payden And Rygel, Ridgeworth Funds, Stadion Funds, Equinox Funds, American Century, State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), Keeley Investments, Astor, ICON, Eventide, Sierra Funds, Madison, Salient Funds, PMC Funds, Reaves Asset Management, Integrity, Virtus, T Rowe Price, Pacific Funds, Princeton, Manning & Napier, Oak Ridge, Causeway Funds, Aquila, Polen Capital Management, Burnham Funds, Cambiar Funds, Nationwide/Gartmore, Arrow Funds, Amana Funds, James Alpha Management, Pax World Funds, Sterling Capital Funds, Gavekal, Frost Funds, Aberdeen, Arbitrage Funds, SEI, JOHCM, Guinness Atkinson Funds, Credit Suisse Funds, William Blair & Co, Profunds, REMS, Advisors Asset Management, Rivernorth Funds, Olstein Funds, Direxion, Ridgeworth, Marshfield, Emerald, Alternative Core Solutions, Pacific Life, API, Brandes, Grandeur Peak, TS Capital LLC, James Advantage Funds, Intrepid Capital Funds, Hatteras, Center Funds, Westwood, MD Sass, Snow Capital Investment, Conestoga Funds, PNC Capital Advisors, Third, Century Funds, Dunham, Lucia Capital Mgmt, Maingate, Saratoga, Kinetic Funds, Angel Oak, Eagle MLP, FAM, Advisory Research, Colorado Bond Shares, James Alpha Managment, Satuit Capital, Mutual Hedge Frontier Legends, Aston, AIG, TFS Capital, Center Coast MLP, Symetra, Empiric Funds, Horizon Kinetics, Lattice, Longboard Asset Management, Schroder, Dearborn Partners, Kopernik, Cedar Capital, Miller Investment, Brookfield Investment Management, 361 Funds, Harbor Funds, First Investors, Geneva Advisors.

Overview
Investing in Mutual Funds
Portfolio Solutions





What is a mutual fund?
A mutual fund is a pool of stocks, bonds and other securities held in trust on behalf of individual investors. When you invest in a mutual fund, you purchase units in a professionally managed portfolio of securities, with each unit representing a share of ownership in the portfolio.
You can hold a mutual fund on its own as a non-registered investment, or within your registered plan — TFSA, RRSP, RRIF, RESP and RDSP.

Overview
Investing in Mutual Funds
Portfolio Solutions





Why choose RBC Royal Bank?
Whether you’re looking for investments that are conservative, growth oriented or a mix of both, we’ve made it easy for you to invest in mutual funds.  Work with an RBC advisor to choose from our broad range of professionally managed portfolio solutions , or from our line-up of individual mutual funds, including RBC Funds  and PH&N Funds . 
Benefits of investing in mutual funds:

Professional management – with mutual funds, a professional money manager is responsible for making investment decisions and monitoring the markets, so you don’t have to.
Access to markets – mutual funds provide convenient and risk appropriate access to the growth potential of global capital markets, including equities and fixed income.
Diversification – because mutual funds invest in a variety of equities, bonds and other holdings, investors can create a balanced and diversified investment portfolio with a relatively modest amount of money.
Flexibility – for a minimum initial investment of only $500 you have access to a professionally managed portfolio.  You can also establish a regular investing program for only $25 per month. You can choose the frequency that works best for you whether that's weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.
Liquidity – your money is readily accessible because you can redeem your units as the need arises.

RBC Global Asset Management announces planned changes to U.S. money market funds

Nov 30, 2015, 09:00 ET
		  		  															
						 from   RBC 











 
















































 

 




















 


MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - RBC Global Asset Management-US (RBC  GAM-US) announced today actions of the RBC Funds Trust Board of  Trustees regarding changes to its money market funds in response to  amendments to regulations governing money market mutual funds.
"RBC Global Asset Management has a long history of offering liquidity  and fixed income strategies as part of our investment platform. With  money market reform on the horizon, many investors are rethinking their  approach to cash management and looking for alternative solutions,"  said Mike Lee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of  RBC GAM-US. "Following close consultation and discussion with our  clients, we feel that our lineup of cash management options is well  positioned to serve the long term interests of investors as they  navigate these changes."
RBC Money Market Funds
The U.S. Government Money Market Fund will continue to be offered to all  investors. The fund currently invests 99.5% or more of its assets in  U.S. Government securities or repurchase agreements and plans to  continue to operate in accordance with money market reform amendments,  including seeking to maintain a stable $1.00 net asset value per share  (NAV).
The Board of Trustees also stated its intention to not currently  implement liquidity fees or redemption gates for the U.S. Government  Money Market Fund.
The Prime Money Market Fund will no longer be offered to institutional  or retail investors after September 30, 2016 and will be closed to new  investments at a date to be determined, pending final Board approval  and appropriate notice to shareholders. Shareholders invested in the  fund will be notified of their options, including eligibility to  exchange shares of the Prime Money Market Fund for shares of the U.S.  Government Money Market Fund.
Money Market Reform
Under the amendments to Rule 2a-7, effective October 14, 2016,  institutional prime and municipal money market funds are required to  price and transact shares of such funds at a floating NAV. Retail and  U.S. government money market funds may continue to seek a stable $1.00 NAV.
In addition, both prime and municipal money market funds may be subject  to liquidity fees and redemption gates in the event weekly liquid  assets fall below a designated threshold.
"This is an opportune time for investors to review their cash management  strategies as they look to maintain liquidity and flexibility in their  investment portfolio," said John C. Donohue, Managing Director and Head  of Liquidity Management, RBC GAM-US. "Government money market funds  address that need by seeking to offer safety, liquidity and a  competitive yield."
In addition to several cash management options, including the U.S.  Government Money Market Fund, RBC GAM-US also offers short term fixed  income products such as the RBC Short Duration Fixed Income Fund and  RBC Ultra Short Fixed Income Fund, which can serve to assist our  shareholders who have shorter investment horizons.
RBC Global Asset Management has over $28 billion in global institutional  cash management assets, including over $19 billion in the U.S., as of  September 30, 2015.
For further information about the U.S. Government Money Market Fund,  please visit https://us.rbcgam.com/mutual-funds/money-market-funds/fg-7/fsg-5/fid-11/individual/overview/us-government-money-market-fund.fs.
About RBC Global Asset Management
RBC Global Asset Management (RBC GAM) is the asset management division of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and includes institutional money managers BlueBay Asset  Management and Phillips, Hager & North Investment Management. RBC GAM  is a provider of global investment management services and solutions to  individual, high-net-worth and institutional investors through mutual  funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, pooled funds, separate  accounts and specialty investment strategies. RBC GAM group of  companies manage more than $280 billion USD in assets and have  approximately 1,300 employees located across Canada, the United States,  Europe and Asia.
Before investing, you should carefully consider a fund's investment  objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is  included in the prospectus, which you can request by visiting /mutual-funds/literature/content/default.fs or calling 800.422.2766. Please read the prospectus carefully before  investing. 
An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.  Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at  $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these  funds.
Net Asset Value (NAV) is a mutual fund's price per share, calculated by dividing the total  assets - less any liabilities - by the number of shares outstanding.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.  Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when  interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt  securities. Investments in lower-rated and non-rated securities  presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than  higher-rated securities. Investments in foreign securities involve  greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and  differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for emerging  markets. Derivatives such as futures, forwards, and swaps involve risks  different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented  by more traditional investments. Investments in Mortgage related  securities including pass-through securities and Collateralized  Mortgage Obligation include additional risks that investors should be  aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity  and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic  developments. The Fund's risks are more fully described in the  prospectus. The RBC Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
