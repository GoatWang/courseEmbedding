Natalie Malaszenko Appointed Vice President of Marketing and Digital Strategy for Omni Hotels & Resort


Omni Hotels & Resorts
03.05.14


Share




















Omni Hotels & Resorts has announced the appointment of Natalie Malaszenko as the new vice president of marketing and digital strategies.
In this role, Malaszenko will lead all marketing and digital initiatives targeting guests and prospective guests for the luxury hotel brand. In addition to overseeing the day-to-day marketing operations, she will ensure full integration of brand and creative campaigns across Omni’s operational departments and oversee development and marketing of new products and services. She will report to Tom Santora, chief marketing officer and senior vice president of sales.
“It is exciting to have someone of Natalie’s caliber joining the Omni team – she has been on the frontlines of the significant changes affecting the digital and marketing arenas and has a proven track record of implementing successful strategies,” said Santora. “With Natalie managing our marketing and digital programs, we are confident Omni will continue to create, implement and market the products and services that will maintain our position as a leader in the luxury hotel industry.” 
Malaszenko joins Omni from Hewlett-Packard (HP) where she worked her way up to vice president of global digital marketing. She established and led HP’s first-ever digital center of excellence, which was responsible for the company’s digital ecosystem, digital integration with marketing campaigns and efforts, as well as its presence on channel and retail sites for HP’s business in 96 countries. While there, HP became one of the largest brands in the world, the first to hit 1 million followers on LinkedIn, and the first to stream a live Twitter concert. In addition, under Malaszenko’s direction, hp.com became one of the most trafficked internet sites in the world. 
Previously Malaszenko was director of social media and commerce for PETCO, where she established and led their digital and social media program for the entire company, including its 1,000+ retail locations. She also has held several positions at Dell, including managing global operations for the company’s Communities and Conversations Organization. 
Malaszenko holds a U.S. patent for online navigation and has served on multiple boards including LinkedIn’s Marketing Advisory Board and AOL’s Tech Advisory Board. She earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of New Mexico where she was published in the field of cognitive neuroscience and was a member of their NCAA D1 Alpine Ski Team.
