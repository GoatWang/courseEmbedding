This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

Our approach






Our Master Portfolio Service (MPS) is a discretionary service that’s designed around simplicity and diversity. As a segregated service, it allows you to invest in a variety of collective funds rather than individual shares.
This means that you own the underlying units in each fund, keeping you more closely involved with the funds that underpin your investment.











Our team






MPS is managed by a dedicated investment team with more than 50 years' experience. Our investment managers work closely with our research department to make decisions about the best blend of funds and asset allocation for each model portfolio.
What’s more, we keep administration as simple and clear as possible. We’ll give you a composite tax voucher at the end of the tax year and a six-monthly valuation and portfolio review.
For more regular reviews of your portfolio, log in to view your Online Portfolio Valuation.











Model portfolios






We help you choose from a range of six defined model portfolios:

Growth
Balanced
Income
Cautious
Defensive
High Growth

Each model contains a wide range of unit trusts, investment trusts and open-ended investment companies (OEICs), with each one representing a different style of investing.
Furthermore, MPS also offers an offshore solution with non-UK domiciled models.











Fees and charges






When we buy the underlying funds on your behalf, you’ll find the costs are often lower than the initial charges you’d typically face if you bought them directly.
You'll also benefit from lower ongoing (underlying) charges because we’re able to negotiate institutional rates on your behalf.
For further information, download our Master Portfolio Service rate card.




































How to apply

Call Matthew Salmon on 020 7597 1046 or send an email.

We’ll ask you some questions about your financial situation and investment objectives.
Once your application is approved we will set up an initial meeting with an investment manager.























The value of investments and the income derived from them can go up as well as down and you may not get back your initial investment.

Investment portfolio management software makes it easier to successfully manage your investment structures




Manage your investment portfolios with otris corporate: You will gain a group-wide overview of all the information in your corporate group. Interconnections within the group structures are documented. Relationships within the individual companies are illustrated. Relationship histories become traceable and comprehensible, serving as a basis for the development of your investment concepts. 


 


From the perspective of a group of companies, investment portfolios should achieve a financial return and contribute to the fulfilment of corporate goals. Investment portfolio management should implement the efficient organisation of all tasks that need to be addressed from the perspective of a group of companies in terms of investment portfolios, locations, investors and elected representatives. However, companies often work with isolated partial results, as assignments from the investment portfolio environment are performed by different specialist departments and not seen as an integral corporate task. The use of special software solutions has proven successful in obtaining fast and easy access to all the investment structures and corporate data.





In otris corporate, our software for investment portfolio management, all the important master data and key figures of the individual companies, as well as their investment portfolios, investors, representatives and committees, are centrally managed and clearly interlinked. Together with local data administration, the web-based software architecture of the central solution ensures that your data is consistent and up-to-date. When saving the data, all data and documents are
archived based on the closing date. This means that changes and the statuses of different versions are traceable at any time. The entire application can be reset at the touch of a button to any point in time, so that you always have access to the actual state of the time selected. Moreover, otris corporate can be quickly and easily adapted to meet your specific requirements.

More transparency with investment portfolio management




otris corporate enables you to manage master data, key figures and documents for all the investment structures in a clear and well-structured manner.






One central portal for all your information
otris corporate affords you the maximum level of transparency. Business-critical documents and data are unified in one information platform so that all processes and deadlines can be centrally controlled. Companies, investment portfolios, investors, representatives and committees are organised in the form of digital folders that serve as a repository for the relevant master data and key figures. All documents and contracts are intelligently interlinked with each other and archived in a audit-proof manner.





All important documents in one central application
Documents are recorded locally from within the corporate environment and classified by types. All the investment portfolio documentation is linked with companies, transactions and mandates, whether it concerns contracts, protocols, entries or certificates.





Audit-proof archiving of all documents
In order to gain access to all the important data, three aspects are particularly important in the management of critical business documents: Audit-proof long-term storage, convenient search and filter functions as well as classification of documents. With the KPMG-certified archiving component, you benefit from the most modern archiving functions in accordance with legal requirements and guidelines.





Dates and Deadlines always in view
Active deadline management helps to avoid unnecessary risks. Expiring contracts, appointments to committees or upcoming audits and meetings are monitored and the group of persons responsible is reminded in advance by e-mail. A date and deadline calendar provides the necessary overview.






Committees. Centrally depicted and archived.




The group-wide occupancy of all committees is centrally depicted in the investment portfolio management software and each mandate is historically archived. You can simulate past constellations at the click of a button. You gain a transparent overview of all the functionaries and decision-makers in your companies and investment portfolios. In addition, you can display which committees are appointed by the individual companies, including the number, member name and host company. You can see upcoming replacements and keep an eye on all your current appointments. Related documents provide information about decisions, rulings and committee meeting minutes. Links to individual elected representatives mean you can clearly see which people are active in different positions within the group of companies. Interactive charts help to visualise current occupancies and make navigation easy.






Representatives. Consistently managed and supported.




A mandate is a time-limited function for a person on a company’s committee. All of a person’s mandates within a Group are jointly managed and the related appointments are coordinated across all representatives. All relationships of this kind are interlinked so that you can view the data from different perspectives. Each person’s occupancy situation can be visually depicted using diagrams. The individual committees’ meeting dates are recorded in a calendar so that scheduling conflicts can be detected early on. On request, the people involved can be reminded of their participation by e-mail. In addition, you will find a wide range of documents in the committees’ digital folders such as the invitation with the agenda of the next meeting as well as rulings and minutes from previous meetings that have already been archived.






  








Modern investment portfolio management for more transparency in the corporate group. otris corporate provides you with fast and easy access to all your investment structures and corporate data. It forms the basis for your strategic investment management.


 


Reliable and transparent controlling within investment portfolio management




The investment control feature integrated in otris corporate will support you in managing your investments. It monitors and informs you about what the individual companies within the group contribute to achieve the agreed objectives.






Integrative solution with local access rights
With otris corporate we offer a group-wide integrated software solution with local access rights. This creates a consistent information platform, which is updated immediately after data is input. Important data from subsidiaries, branches and investment portfolios can be seamlessly reported directly to the central corporate control, which can use the data immediately. All parties are thereby provided with the relevant information: Those responsible in the individual investment portfolios can view the data that is associated with their unit.
All the information within the investment network is available to corporate control for evaluation purposes, etc. A central, integrative software solution is especially relevant for monitoring individual investments as it channels all the data streams of the individual investment portfolios and visualises them using a company cockpit. While individual unit solutions, which are not compatible with each other, are able to represent the targets of the respective investment portfolios and companies in an isolated manner, they do not provide an overview from the perspective of the entire company.





Clear evaluations, charts and reports
In otris corporate, your ownership structure and investment portfolios are visually represented in organisational charts. From the organisational chart, you can call up individual companies at the click of a button for an immediate view of all the information in each unit, including: master data, key figures, investment portfolios, investors, elected representatives, documents and contracts.
Any data from investment portfolio management or other sources can be accessed via the integrated business intelligence solution as flexible reports in standard output formats and types of charts. Standardised key figures can be supplemented by additional indicators. Individual evaluations are carried out according to the relevant criteria and all reports are sent automatically and regularly to freely definable e-mail distribution lists.


 


Investment portfolio management offers efficient tools for investment management




otris corporate makes it easier for you to manage your investment portfolios by means of risk observation and investment portfolio simulations as well as the evaluation and analysis of key figures.






Uniform processes ensure high-quality data
Thanks to consistent process orientation, our software solution for investment portfolio management can support your investment management as an integrative solution. All the relevant data from your investment portfolios, branches and subsidiaries is recorded and processed via customisable workflows. For both local companies and corporate control, it’s important for all parties to have quick access to consistent data with quality information.





Complete company data simulation
When saving the data, all data and documents are archived based on the closing date, so that all changes and the statuses of different versions are traceable at any time. In addition, you can reset the entire application at the touch of a button to any point in time, so that you always have access to the reactivated, complete actual state of that point in time. This turns the assistance platform into your personal simulator for investment portfolio history.

Master portfolios - Build your own investment portfolio

What are Master Portfolios?

Master Portfolios are designed to help you get started with investing
There are five example portfolios depending on your aims and attitude to risk
The underlying funds are selected by our investment team and run by the best fund managers in their field
You can tailor each portfolio by changing the percentage invested in each fund according to your own preferences

How do Master Portfolios work?
The portfolios are designed as a starting point, and while each fund is professionally managed, the overall responsibility for selecting and managing the portfolio rests with you. We will send you updates with our latest views on each of the component funds to help you with this.
The portfolios are not personal advice - if you're unsure whether an investment is right for you, contact us for financial advice. All investments fall as well as rise in value - you could get back less than you invest. For this reason we suggest investing for a minimum of five years.

			This aggressive portfolio aims to generate a high level of capital growth by focusing on higher-risk areas like emerging markets and smaller companies.
		

			This medium-risk portfolio aims for a reasonable return with less volatility than more aggressive options.
		

			This defensive portfolio aims for modest growth whilst minimising volatility, though it can still fall in value.
		

			Children usually have a long investment horizon, so this portfolio focuses on higher-risk areas with greater growth potential.
		

			This income portfolio is designed to produce a good level of income with the potential to grow and keep pace with inflation.

                    Master Investment Plan
                












































Master Investment Plan













                    
            Professionally managed investment portfolio to give you greater upside potential in achieving your financial goals.
        

Whatever your financial goal is, your first step is to invest. Master Investment Plan is specially designed to manage your investment by means of units hold. You may take advantage of our professional investment expertise in a portfolio of diversified investments. 




Note: This is an insurance product that is tied to the performance of its underlying assets and is NOT a pure investment product like unit trusts.
    












            Why should I choose this plan?
        






Here are seven reasons to buy this plan:
High Growth Potential and Yields
The success of Master Investment Plan is linked to the different types of investments, including shares bought on Bursa Malaysia, fixed income securities such as bonds, cash deposits and financial investments. This means that the Master Investment Plan, will, over the long term, benefit from any gains made in the stock market as well as from high interest rates earned from bonds and cash deposits. The best time to buy Master Investment Plan is when the stock market is low.

Investment Diversification
Master Investment Plan invests in a large and diversified portfolio of investments on behalf of many investors. With large amounts to manage, Master Investment Plan is able to invest in many different shares as well as place funds in guaranteed areas of return such as cash and bonds. This diversification allows all investors in Master Investment Plan, both large and small, to benefit from broad-based and diversified investments. Diversification helps protect your investment from sudden downturns in individual shareholdings whilst providing consistent returns when markets are rising.

Tax Advantages
Your Master Investment Plan is classified as a ‘Single Premium Investment-Linked Life Insurance Policy’. This means that under current arrangements, when you cash in part or all of your plan in the future, the proceeds are treated in the same way as other Life Insurance policies and is tax-free. This makes Master Investment Plan an ideal investment vehicle for long term savings, especially if you would like to benefit from additional tax-free cash drawings from your Master Investment Plan during retirement.

Professional Investment Management
No longer do you have to worry about what to buy, or when. Zurich’s professional investment management team in Malaysia has over 30 years’ experience in money management, buying and selling stocks and shares, bonds and placing funds in areas which secure the best rates of return. In addition, the team can tap into the diverse expertise and experience of investment professionals working for Zurich around the globe. This has resulted in thousands of investors making consistently good returns as policyholders of Zurich. Your Master Investment Plan provides professional money management around the clock, freeing you to do the things you want to do, and providing you with peace of mind.

Choice of Funds
Master Investment Plan offers a selection of funds to choose from under one plan to suit your individual investment requirements.

Transfer/Switch Facility
Master Investment Plan allows you to switch your investments from one fund to another whenever you need, giving you ultimate control over your investment exposure.

Death or Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Benefit
Master Investment Plan will pay out a guaranteed Death or Total and Permanent Disability Benefit, in the unlikely event of something happening to you. This makes Master Investment Plan an ideal planning vehicle when investing for your future, your loved ones as well as yourself.

How are my accounts protected?

Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

About bonds:
A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

Learn About the Risks of Options Trading




Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Options investors may lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short period of time.
Prior to buying or selling options, investors must read a copy of the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options brochure (PDF), also known as the options disclosure document. It explains the characteristics and risks of exchange traded options.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
