                About Specific Beauty 
              

After noticing a lack of skincare products catering to women of color and those dealing with hyperpigmentation, Dr. Heather Woolery-Lloyd devised her own recipes over the course of a decade. She based her approach on the time-tested Kligman Formula––devised by the founder of modern dermatology––that supports combining active ingredients to treat skin quickly and instill discipline in temporary tattoos. Today, her Specific Beauty line has been praised by the Today show and numerous magazines.
Packaged in cerulean-blue bottles, products such as hydrating lotions and skin-brightening serums work to even out complexions, brighten skin, and lighten dark spots on an à la carte basis or team up in the comprehensive Specific Beauty Regimen package. They eschew common chemical components such as paraben, hydroquinone, and hydrocortisone, choosing instead to refurbish skin with natural licorice and ginger root. These alternative approaches have showcased their efficacy in blind tests, independent lab trials, and a clinical six-week trial in which most regimen participants reported a lightening in skin tone. To further public knowledge of general skincare, Dr. Woolery-Lloyd doles out pro tips online, in national lectures, in her private practice, and at the University of Miami, where she is the director of ethnic skincare.

Mission Bay rendering

SAN FRANCISCO—SOMA Hotel LLC, a privately held hotel development company, has acquired a development site to build a 250-key hotel here in the South of Market area for an undisclosed amount. It will be the city’s first full-service hotel project since 2008, according to the developer.
The site was purchased from Block 1 Associates, LLC, a joint venture between Blackrock Real Estate and Strada Investment Group. Block 1 owns the adjacent land and has announced plans to build 350 units of residential condominiums and apartments.
Construction on the 15-story hotel is slated to begin in fourth quarter with an expected opening in fourth-quarter 2016.
The property will be a to-be-named, branded lifestyle hotel and will feature meeting space and food and beverage offerings.  The hotel will be environmentally constructed in accordance with LEED-Gold standards. 
Affiliates of SOMA will oversee construction of the hotel and operate it upon opening. 
The fully entitled, 23,000-sq.-ft. site is part of the Mission Bay Redevelopment Plan and is located on Channel St. between 3rd and 4th Sts, situated one block from AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants. 
The new hotel will serve multiple nearby demand generators in the South of Market area, including numerous high-tech companies, the University of California San Francisco Mission Bay Campus and its 289-bed hospital, several clinics and research facilities. Nearby current and under-construction rail systems will provide guests with access to the city’s main attractions, such as the Moscone Convention Center, Union Square, Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf.
“Downtown San Francisco is one of the most difficult cities for new construction, due to scarcity of land and high barriers to new construction,” stated Will Gibbs, SVP, SOMA Hotel. “This will be the first four-star, new-build hotel in the city’s urban core since 2008.  The South of Market district is the city’s most dynamic location and there is a minimal presence of hotels there.”

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

SOME DATA MAY BE OUT-OF-DATE
TaxBuzz uses basic business information from third-party data providers. We have built our database from these public records and sources. In the process, some of the data may appear out-of-date. We allow business owners to claim their listings to make sure we are showing the most accurate profiles and contact information.
This profile has been flagged as possibly being out-of-date, and it may mean the professional is no longer practicing or has not renewed their Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) with the IRS which is required to prepare and sign tax returns.

IRS Annual Filing Season Program Participant




This individual is a participant in the IRS's voluntary tax preparer program, which generally includes the passage of an annual testing requirement (1) and the completion of a significant number of hours of continuing education. Preparers satisfying these educational requirements and agreeing to abide by the IRS's rules are allowed to represent clients whose returns they prepared and signed, but only before revenue agents, customer service representatives, and similar IRS employees, including the Taxpayer Advocate Service. This extremely important privilege is not extended to tax preparers who are not attorneys, certified public accountants, or enrolled agents. To be eligible, tax preparers must complete the AFSP requirement every tax year.
(1) In states that have their own program; the annual testing requirement is waived.

Getting Your Accounting in Order: The Best Tips Small Businesses Need to Know
Tuesday, July 25, 2017
It's no secret that cash flow is one of the most pressing issues facing small business owners today, regardless of the type of organization they're running or even the industry in which they're operating. Not only is it one of the major reasons why smaller companies fail, but it's also deceptively complex. Just because you can balance a personal checkbook doesn't mean that you have the skill set necessary to do justice to something with so many disparate moving parts....
