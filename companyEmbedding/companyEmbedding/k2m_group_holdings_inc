K2M Group Holdings, Inc. Receives 510(k) Clearance for CAPRI™ Small 3D Static Corpectomy Cage System from FDA
Jun 28 17
K2M Group Holdings, Inc. announced that its CAPRI™ Small 3D Static Corpectomy Cage System has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). CAPRI Small 3D Static is a first-to-market, 3D-printed, FDA-cleared corpectomy cage, and the Company’s third product family to feature Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology™. This clearance marks a milestone for the Company, which provides 3D-printed solutions for MIS, degenerative, and now complex spine procedures. K2M was the first spine company to market a 3D-printed spinal implant and offers the most comprehensive portfolio of 3D-printed spinal devices. CAPRI Small 3D Static provides a surgical solution for stabilizing the thoracolumbar spine (T1 to L5) in cases of vertebral body resections resulting from trauma or tumor. Its porous structure and rough surface architectures are designed to allow for bony integration throughout an implant. The system’s lordotic options help support the anterior spinal column with the goal of achieving sagittal balance. K2M's Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology uses an advanced 3D printing method to create structures that are impossible with traditional manufacturing techniques. Starting with a titanium powder, the CAPRI Small 3D Static corpectomy cages are grown through the selective application of a high-energy laser beam, incorporating complex internal geometries and rough surface architecture that pre-clinical data have associated with bone growth activity. Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology incorporates a porous structure along with rough surfaces to allow the potential for bony integration throughout the cage. Balance ACS (or BACS™) is a comprehensive platform applying three-dimensional solutions across the entire clinical care continuum to help drive quality outcomes in spine patients. BACS provides surgical solutions focused on achieving balance of the spine by addressing each anatomical vertebral segment with a 360-degree approach of the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, emphasizing Total Body Balance as an important component to critical success.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

K2M Group Holdings, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results And Announces Key Product Approvals In Japan






GlobeNewswire



May 2, 2017 4:01 PM EDT













 


















































 LEESBURG, Va., May 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- K2M Group Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:KTWO) (the "Company" or "K2M"), a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance TM, today reported financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017.   First Quarter 2017 Financial Summary:   Total Q1 revenue of $61.9 million, up 9.9% year-over-year. Total Q1 revenue increased 10.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Domestic Q1 revenue of $46.2 million, up 9.5% year-over-year, comprised of:- U.S. Complex Spine growth of 7.6% year-over-year- U.S. Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) growth of 14.4% year-over-year- U.S. Degenerative growth of 9.4% year-over-year. International Q1 revenue of $15.7 million, up 11.1% year-over-year, or 14.4% on a constant currency basis. Net loss of $10.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $10.2 million in the comparable period last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.1 million in the comparable period last year.    Year-to-Date 2017 Highlights:   On February 15, 2017, the Company introduced Balance ACS TM (or BACS TM), a comprehensive platform featuring products and services that apply three-dimensional solutions across the full continuum of care with the goal of facilitating quality outcomes for patients undergoing spinal surgery. BACS provides solutions focused on achieving balance of the spine by addressing each anatomical vertebral segment with a 360-degree approach of the axial, coronal and sagittal planes, emphasizing Total Body Balance as an important component to surgical success. On April 6, 2017, K2M and LifeHealthcare Group Limited announced a new distribution agreement for K2M's innovative spinal technologies in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). The K2M/LifeHealthcare distribution partnership dates back to 2010 and has yielded strong growth and a significant spine market position in ANZ. Looking to build on this success, K2M and LifeHealthcare entered into a new five-year agreement with the shared goal of establishing a number one spine market position in ANZ. On April 21, 2017, K2M received key product registrations in Japan from the PMDA, which are now under its control, including the MESA ® and EVEREST ® product lines.  "We have made significant progress during the first four months of 2017, driving toward our fiscal year growth objectives and achieving multiple operational milestones, which together will enhance our ability to increase our share of the global spine market over time. We reported constant currency revenue growth of 10.7% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by 10% growth in the U.S. and 14.4% constant currency growth in our international markets," said President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Major. "We delivered strong revenue growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, which represents solid performance in light of the 20% U.S. growth we reported in the same period last year, and we continue to believe in our ability to grow U.S. revenue in the mid-teens in 2017. Outside the U.S., we continue to see progress in both Australia and Japan that is in line with our goal of creating a solid foundation for future growth in each of these markets. In April, we announced a new supply agreement with our Australian partner, LifeHealthcare. Later in April, we received product registrations in Japan, that we now control, for key products including our MESA and EVEREST systems. With these registrations, K2M will have an opportunity to implement a new distribution strategy in the entire spine surgery market in Japan."

BACS provides solutions focused on achieving balance of the spine by addressing each anatomical vertebral segment with a 360-degree approach of the axial, coronal and sagittal planes, emphasizing Total Body Balance as an important component to surgical success.On April 6, 2017, K2M and LifeHealthcare Group Limited announced a new distribution agreement for K2M's innovative spinal technologies in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). The K2M/LifeHealthcare distribution partnership dates back to 2010 and has yielded strong growth and a significant spine market position in ANZ. Looking to build on this success, K2M and LifeHealthcare entered into a new five-year agreement with the shared goal of establishing a number one spine market position in ANZ.On April 21, 2017, K2M received key product registrations in Japan from the PMDA, which are now under its control, including the MESA® and EVEREST® product lines.“We have made significant progress during the first four months of 2017, driving toward our fiscal year growth objectives and achieving multiple operational milestones, which together will enhance our ability to increase our share of the global spine market over time. We reported constant currency revenue growth of 10.7% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by 10% growth in the U.S. and 14.4% constant currency growth in our international markets,” said President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Major. “We delivered strong revenue growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, which represents solid performance in light of the 20% U.S. growth we reported in the same period last year, and we continue to believe in our ability to grow U.S. revenue in the mid-teens in 2017. Outside the U.S., we continue to see progress in both Australia and Japan that is in line with our goal of creating a solid foundation for future growth in each of these markets. In April, we announced a new supply agreement with our Australian partner, LifeHealthcare. Later in April, we received product registrations in Japan, that we now control, for key products including our MESA and EVEREST systems. With these registrations, K2M will have an opportunity to implement a new distribution strategy in the entire spine surgery market in Japan.”     First Quarter 2017 Financial Results     Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/Decrease   ($, thousands)   2017 2016 $ Change   % Change   % Change               (as reported)   (constant currency)   United States   $46,207 $42,193 $4,014   9.5 %   9.5 %   International   15,678   14,113 1,565   11.1 %   14.4 %   Total Revenue   $61,885 $56,306 $5,579   9.9 %   10.7 %                         Total revenue for the first quarter 2017 increased $5.6 million, or 9.9%, to $61.9 million, compared to $56.3 million for the first quarter of 2016. Total revenue increased 10.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume from primarily domestic new surgeon users and newer product offerings, offset partially by lower sales in certain international distributor markets as compared to last year.Revenue in the United States increased $4.0 million, or 9.5% year-over-year, to $46.2 million, and international revenue increased $1.6 million, or 11.1% year-over-year, to $15.7 million. First quarter 2017 international revenue increased 14.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency exchange impacted first quarter international revenue by approximately $0.4 million, representing approximately 329 basis points of international growth year-over-year.The following table represents domestic revenue by procedure category.      Three Months Ended March 31,   Increase/Decrease   ($, thousands)   2017 2016   $ Change   % Change   Complex Spine   $17,136 $15,930   $1,206   7.6 %   Minimally Invasive   7,872 6,881   991   14.4 %   Degenerative   21,199 19,382   1,817   9.4 %   U.S. Revenue   $46,207 $42,193   $4,014   9.5 %                     By procedure category, U.S. revenue in the Company’s complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 37.1%, 17.0% and 45.9% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 increased 10.1% to $40.4 million, compared to $36.7 million for the first quarter 2016.  Gross margin was 65.3% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 65.2% last year. Gross profit includes amortization expense on investments in surgical instruments of $3.5 million, or 5.6% of sales, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $3.3 million, or 5.8% of sales, for the comparable period last year.Operating expenses for the first quarter 2017 increased $2.9 million, or 6.1%, to $49.5 million, compared to $46.6 million for the first quarter 2016. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by a $2.7 million increase in sales and marketing expenses compared to the comparable period last year.Loss from operations for the first quarter of 2017 improved  $0.8 million, to $9.1 million, compared to a loss from operations of $9.9 million for the comparable period last year.

The increase in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to interest expense incurred on the capital lease obligation related to our headquarters and operations facilities as well as the Convertible Senior Notes issued in August 2016, and, to a lesser extent, an increase of $0.4 million year-over-year in unrealized losses from foreign currency re-measurement on intercompany payable balances.  Foreign currency losses impacted operating results compared to last year due to changes in the average exchange rates of the U.S. Dollar, Pound Sterling and Euro applied to intercompany balances in both periods. Read MoreNet loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $10.9 million, or $(0.26) per diluted share, compared to a loss of $10.2 million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $38.6 million as compared to $45.5 million as of December 31, 2016.

to Non-GAAP Measures(Unaudited) (In Thousands)Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue in constant currency, Adjusted Gross Profit, and Adjusted EBITDA.The Company presents these non-GAAP measures because it believes these measures are useful indicators of the Company’s operating performance.  Management uses these non-GAAP measures principally as a measure of the Company's operating performance and believes that these measures are useful to investors because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry.  The Company also believes that these measures are useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-to-period.  We calculate constant currency by converting the prior-year results using current-year foreign currency exchange rates.Adjusted Gross Profit represents Gross Profit less amortization expense of surgical instruments.  The Company presented Adjusted Gross Profit because it believes it is a useful measure of the Company's gross profit and operating performance because the measure is not burdened by the timing impact of instrument purchases and related amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents net loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency transaction loss (gain).The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is a useful indicator of the Company’s operating performance.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA principally as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget and financial projections. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.  In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future.  Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized.  In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.  The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments.  Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on its GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally.  The Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.The following table presents reconciliations
