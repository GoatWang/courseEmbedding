Placing the Spotlight on Invesco Value Municipal Income Trust (IIM)
28 Juillet 2017



Checking in on some other technical levels, the 14-day RSI is now at 49.39, the 7-day stands at 49.24, and the 3-day is sitting at 52.62. Employing the use of the moving average for technical equity analysis is still highly popular among traders and investors. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Laurion Capital Management LP now owns 58,395 shares of the investment management company's stock valued at $720,000 after buying an additional 23,711 shares during the last quarter. The Parabolic SAR will move from being below price to above price and the trader would sell any existing long positions and reverse direction and go short.Taking a deeper dive into the numbers, Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc (AERI) has a 50-day Moving Average of 52.32, the 200-day Moving Average is 44.15, and the 7-day is noted at 56.00. The moving average is a popular tool among technical stock analysts. Moving averages may be used by investors and traders to shed some light on trading patterns for a specific stock. A value of 50-75 would identify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would lead to an extremely strong trend. In some cases, MA's may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels.
Ils se rencontrent enfin à la télévision
Vous avez 24 heures pour décider dans quelle ville vous voulez avoir votre premier rendez-vous et on vous y envoie!". Ensuite, ils se sont enfin rencontrés après trois ans d'attente: un date face aux caméras un peu gênant quand même!
Shifting gears to the Relative Strength Index, the 14-day RSI is now sitting at 22.15, the 7-day is 13.12, and the 3-day is now at 3.91 for Banro Corp (BAA). Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. The CCI may be used to spot if a stock is entering overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) territory.At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for athenahealth Inc (ATHN) is 26.55. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, and it oscillates between 0 and 100. The RSI may be useful for spotting abnormal price activity and volatility. This represents a $0.66 annualized dividend and a dividend yield of 5.68%. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. The 14-day RSI is now sitting at 54.28, the 7-day is at 48.68, and the 3-day is spotted at 31.03 for athenahealth Inc (ATHN).

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

Morningstar OpinionInvesco Value Municipal Income   has its pros and cons. The fund is run by a tenured management team, is overseen by an established parent company, and charges one of the lowest expense ratios of the leveraged municipal fund peer group. However, the fund has struggled to translate these positive characteristics into above-average performance and has typically lagged its peer group on both an absolute and volatility-adjusted basis. Despite the subpar performance, the fund's positive characteristics have earned it a Morningstar Analyst Rating of Bronze.Formerly an insured muni fund, IIM dropped its insurance mandate and merged with two similar funds in 2012. As a result, the current portfolio has a higher quality tilt than some of Invesco's other leveraged municipal CEFs: Roughly 85% of assets are rated A or above and 13% are rated BBB. Rather than take on credit risk, the portfolio generates high income by situating its assets primarily on the longer end of the yield curve. With a weighted average maturity of 16.9 years, the portfolio also had an effective duration of 9.9 years, indicating a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Although 24% of assets will become callable over the next five years, this is somewhat low for the peer group. The management team was appointed to this fund in 2009 with Invesco's acquisition of Van Kampen, though it remained intact throughout the transition, and the three head managers have worked together since 1996. In all, the investment-grade municipal team includes a quantitative portfolio analyst, two traders, and seven credit analysts. We like that Robert Wimmel has about 17 years of portfolio management experience, while other members of the team tout an average 20 years of investment experience. Although this portfolio invests principally in investment-grade credit, the managers also draw on the research of a separate high-yield municipal team. Morningstar has assigned Invesco a Positive parent rating.Despite these positive characteristics, overall performance has been lackluster. Since the current management team took over, the fund has underperformed the leveraged national municipal category in four of the last five years, and over trailing one-, three-, and five-year periods. While volatility has been below-average, volatility-adjusted performance also has been below average over these periods.For the fiscal year ending February 2013, the fund charged an adjusted expense ratio of 0.57%, which was far below average for leveraged national municipal funds. Even after adding the cost of leverage, the total expense ratio of 0.98% was among the lowest of the peer group. Investors should note that the fund redeemed its auction-rate preferred shares in favor of a more expensive form of leverage financing three months into the reporting period, so the future expense ratio could be slightly higher.Back to Top
Portfolio Process ApproachFormerly an insured muni fund, IIM dropped its insurance mandate and merged with two similar funds in 2012. As a result, the current portfolio has a higher quality tilt than some of Invesco’s other leveraged municipal CEFs. Invesco's municipal team is composed of two sleeves: One focuses on investment-grade bonds and one on high-yield bonds. This portfolio is managed by the former, but it can draw on the research of the latter. The investment-grade sleeve includes six credit analysts, two traders, a quantitative portfolio analyst, and four portfolio managers. Each sector is covered by a primary analyst and two secondary analysts. Analysts assign internal credit ratings to each security along with a credit outlook, which managers view alongside ratings from major rating organizations. High-yield analysts conduct site interviews, which is especially important for securities without a rating from a major rating organization. Analysts are in charge of keeping an eye on securities held in the portfolio. Managers use the internal credit ratings to determine whether specific bonds are fairly valued and generally give an overweighting to sectors where they see more value (though the portfolio has exposure limits on credit ratings and sector). Interest-rate exposure is determined in relation to an internal benchmark, which is based on peers' interest-rate exposure. Managers sometimes use derivatives to tweak interest-rate exposure if it strays too far from the benchmark.Back to Top
Portfolio PositioningThe fund generally focuses on longer duration, higher-quality municipal bonds. As of April 2013, 85% of assets were rated A or above, while 13% were rated BBB. Geographically, the portfolio had its highest exposure to California (19%), Texas (11%), Florida (9%), and Illinois (9%). Seventy-six percent of assets were invested in revenue bonds, with top sectors including hospitals (11%) and public power (10%). The remaining portion of the portfolio was comprised mainly of local general obligation (11%) and prerefunded (8%) debt.Bonds were generally positioned on the longer end of the yield curve, giving the portfolio a weighted average maturity of 16.9 years. This translated to an effective duration of 9.9 years, indicating a relatively high sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Call exposure was moderate, with 13% of assets becoming callable in the next three years, and 24% over the next five years.The portfolio had minuscule exposure to the Alternative Minimum Tax.Back to Top
DistributionsIIM has paid a monthly distribution of $0.075 per share since 2011. However, Invesco estimates that the fund under earned its distribution by roughly 6% in fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, many similar CEFs are underearning their distributions by a wider margin. Considering that the fund still has $0.1182 per share in undistributed net investment income, the fund may continue to over-distribute until this balance is depleted.The fund offers a standard dividend reinvestment plan, in which shares are purchased at market price if they are trading at a discount. If shares are trading at a premium, the fund will issues new shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then-current share price. Back to Top
DiscountAfter a recent sell-off across long-duration municipal CEFs, shares of IIM are currently trading at an 6.9% discount, well below its three-year average discount of 1.6%. While underearning its distribution and having a portfolio with high interest-rate sensitivity might warrant a small discount, the current discount is somewhat wide, in our opinion. Over the last three years, shares traded between a 9.4% premium and an 11.3% discount. Back to Top
NAV Performance AnalysisTotal return performance has been lackluster overall. Over trailing one-, three-, and five-year periods, the fund logged annualized total returns of 2.5%, 8.0%, and 7.6%. In comparison, the peer group returned an average 3.8%, 9.0%, and 7.9% over the same period. Since the current management team took over this portfolio, the fund has underperformed in four of the last five years. While performance has generally been less volatile than average, volatility-adjusted returns were still below average. The fund logged Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Returns of 11.5% and 9.8% over trailing three- and five-year periods, while the peer group returned an average 13.0% and 10.4%.Back to Top
Risk & ReturnWhile the fund pays an above-average distribution rate, total return performance has typically has been lower and more volatile than many of its peers. Looking forward, interest-rate risk is a concern. The fund's 9.9-year duration, while not unusual for a leveraged municipal fund, indicates that the portfolio is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Should the longer end of the yield curve rise, the portfolio would likely suffer capital losses. Back to Top
FeesFor the fiscal year ending February 2013, the fund charged an adjusted expense ratio of 0.57%, which was far below average for leveraged national municipal funds. Even after adding in the cost of leverage, the total expense ratio of 0.98% was among the lowest of the peer group. Investors should note that the fund redeemed its auction-rate preferred shares in favor of a more expensive form of leverage financing three months into the reporting period, so the future expense ratio could be slightly higher.The fund pays a 0.55% management fee on the fund's total daily assets. We do not like that this metric includes the proceeds from leverage. This gives managers an incentive to take on extra leverage for the sake of generating higher fees.Back to Top
LeverageIn 2012, the fund redeemed its auction-rate preferred shares in favor of variable-rate muni-fund term preferred shares (VMTPs). In addition, the fund uses tender option bonds (TOBs) to create additional leverage. After the fund's recent merger, it has $143 million in outstanding VMTPs, and $198 million in TOBs. The VMTPs are set to expire in June 2015. Considering that the interest rates paid on these forms of leverage financing are often more expensive than ARPS, the fund is now paying more for its leverage financing. Because both forms of leverage are varying-rate, an increase in interest rates would further increase the costs of leverage.In all, this gives the fund a leverage ratio (total assets/net assets) of 1.43, which is slightly below-average for leveraged municipal funds.Back to Top
PeopleThe portfolio is managed by Invesco's investment-grade municipal team, which is headed by Robert Wimmel. The team also includes comanagers Robert Stryker and Thomas Byron, a quantitative portfolio analyst, two traders, and seven credit analysts. The team works closely with the high-yield municipal team, which has seven credit analysts and is headed by two portfolio managers. On average, staff members have about 21 years of industry experience. We like that the team remained intact after Invesco's acquisition of Van Kampen. Although the team only took over management of this portfolio in 2009, the three managers have worked together since 1996.The investment-grade team runs about $14 billion. While we are disappointed that none of the managers owns shares of this fund, they each own between $100,000 and $500,000 in shares of the Invesco municipal fund complex. Managers are paid a base salary and a discretionary bonus, which considers one-, three-, and five-year performance against their funds' respective peer groups.Back to Top
ParentInvesco has meaningfully improved its stewardship profile. Notably, the firm's fund lineup is more sensible in the wake of its 2010 acquisition of Van Kampen's funds. Among other changes, Van Kampen's Jim Gilligan replaced Invesco's U.S. Value Equity CIO Brent Stanley, and the combined lineup of funds was reduced by half (mainly via merging overlapping strategies). Funds with lower fees and the better management team survived, and changes to the fund offerings are still under way. The firm just clears the threshold to earn a positive Parent rating under Morningstar's methodology. While fees are reasonable overall, they could be lower, and managers' investments in their own funds' shares often fall short of the industry's best-practices level. Some areas of weakness remain, especially among the taxable fixed-income funds. The firm will need to demonstrate that its cultural improvements are sticking and result in tangible long-term benefits for fund shareholders.Back to Top
Board of DirectorsThe 11-member board of directors includes two interested directors, Colin Meadows and Wayne Whalen. Meadows is chief administrative office of Invesco and joined the board in 2010 after Invesco's acquisition of Van Kampen, and Whalen is a partner in a law firm that provides legal counsel to Invesco. Five directors have served on numerous boards since 1994 (previously Van Kampen funds). Each board member serves on other boards both inside and outside the complex. Four members sit on more than 230 boards within the fund complex.Board member terms are staggered, and each member is up for reelection every three years. While we like periodic elections, the staggered board can lead to director entrenchment.During the latest fiscal year, each director was paid about $150,000 to serve on all of Invesco's boards, which is in line with average payments to directors of other CEFs. We like that eight members of the board own shares in the fund, though only one member, Rodney Dammeyer, owns a significant stake (about $2.6 million). Back to Top
