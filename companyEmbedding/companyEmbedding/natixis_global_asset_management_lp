Retirement Income
A New Way to Fund Life in Retirement Retirement is a time of change, as individuals prepare to rely on their accumulated savings – rather than a paycheck – for income. Investment portfolios need to be reconfigured to play a new role: generating cash flow to support both current expenses and a long-term retirement. Generating income and protecting against loss take on greater importance for investors transitioning to retirement.  The Natixis ASG Retirement Spending Account is a separately managed account designed as an all-in-one solution to address key retirement funding needs:  

Consistent monthly income
Customized by withdrawal rate and starting year
Actively managed to control risk
Dynamic asset allocation
Easy to implement

It offers a choice of eight specialized portfolios. Each one uses the Adaptive Retirement Income Glidepath®, designed to protect against excessive losses early in retirement and increase opportunities for growth later on. The account seeks to provide a monthly source of income throughout retirement, with the flexibility to adjust each year, or as investors’ circumstances change.
