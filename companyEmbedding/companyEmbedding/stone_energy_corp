Stone Energy - An Update On Production Will Be Looked At Positively - Stone Energy Corp (NYSE:SGY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Stone Energy - An Update On Production Will Be Looked At PositivelyJul. 8.15 | About: Stone Energy (SGY) Dallas Salazar IPOs, contrarian, long/short equity, long-term horizonATLAS CONSULTINGSummaryStone Energy (SGY) is out with a seemingly positive operations update.
        But I have to wonder on the topic of production before taking this update at face value.
        The production numbers and guidance are great; That’s never a bad thing so don’t let me make it out to seem like this update wasn’t at the very least neutral.
        But, this is a line item worth reviewing considering that prior to this update SGY only had ~50% of 2015 guided production hedged at $92/bbl and $4.15 mcfe.
        Increases to guided production mean selling to spot markets for over hedging balance covered production.
        Stone Energy (NYSE:SGY) is out with a seemingly positive operations update in which it updates investors as to the following:

Operations at its Cardona #6 development well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico have been proceeding ahead of schedule and below budget, and drilling has been completed through the targeted zones
SGY expects Q2 production to come in at or above the high end of previous guidance of 246MM-258MM cfe/day, the result of reduced scheduled third-party pipeline downtime in the deepwater Gulf and flatter than expected production declines in Appalachia
SGY says it may realize additional upward revisions in Appalachian production in Q2 earnings pending participation elections by SGY's operating partners

From the looks of those headlines this update isn't "seemingly positive" it flat out is positive. But I have to wonder on the topic of production before taking this update at face value.
First, the production numbers and guidance are great. That's never a bad thing so don't let me make it out to seem like this update wasn't at the very least neutral. But, this is a line item worth reviewing considering that prior to this update SGY only had ~50% of 2015 guided production hedged at $92/bbl and $4.15 mcfe. Increases to guided production mean selling to spot markets for over hedging balance covered production, more so than prior.
Without SGY listing its IRR's in its investor deck this information isn't readily available. That said, even factoring in that SGY has low GOM costs of supply I assume with oil tanking the last few weeks to an intraday spot of $52 and natural gas trading on the lows ($2.73 spot - this will have a marked effect on the Marcellus production) that the IRR's are less than ideal. The point to be made here is maybe more production isn't the best thing in the immediate term in that realized IRR's are at multi-year (some would argue historic) lows. We'll have to wait for Q2/15 reporting to be sure. Still, let it be known that the saving grace here is that SGY isn't contributing additional capital to drive this increased production and that makes a world of difference. Essentially zero extra cost low IRR production is better than nothing at all, period.

That said, the fact that SGY updated positively for both the GOM and its Appalachian production does work well into my "SGY Acquisition" thesis. I've opined prior that SGY is a unique acquisition that would look good as a bolt-on either as-is or cut up to pieces and sold off individually. SGY having a more successful than expected run in the GOM and noting lower decline rates in the Appalachian are huge value-add's to buyout value. The lower decline rates especially.
I've talked before in reference to SGY about how undervalued its GOM assets are and how really the entire GOM is, especially the Shelf Miocene (SGY isn't a player in this zone). I think that with the price of oil presumably lower for longer, especially if you believe a source of mine in regards to Saudi production, the GOM will begin to both bid at a premium in the public markets and become an ever increasingly attractive M&A focus. That should do well for SGY equity.
The other thing worth reiterating, that has nothing to do with this press release by the way, is that SGY has an untapped revolver that it can lean on going forward that should keep it safe from what I've been told are going to be fall redetermination revolver raids. That too will help price SGY at a premium and further its M&A potential.
Everything in oil and gas right now is in flux. I've been back and forth on SGY in stating that I don't like its underlying production mix ~50%/50% to make it a front runner should we realize my long called for natural gas commodity bull to end the year. That said, I also have opined that SGY's asset plays could be very attractive to a mid-major or major looking to shelve some fine assets at discount pricing. Even in today's environment a divestiture and/or buyout would take place a premium to spot equity pricing. Of course that's something I would want readers to be long.
With SGY invest at your own risk. I can see both sides of this story, both an underperformance and an overperformance playing out. With that being the case, I remain on the sidelines until Q2/15 reporting.

Good luck everybody.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Stone Energy Corporation Announces Successful Completion of Financial Restructuring and Emergence from Bankruptcy

Stone Energy Corporation

LAFAYETTE, La., Feb. 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Stone Energy Corporation (NYSE:    SGY) ("Stone" or the "Company") today announced that it successfully completed the conditions precedent to emerging from chapter 11 reorganization, and, accordingly, the Company's Second Amended Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization of Stone Energy Corporation and its Debtor Affiliates, dated December 28, 2016 (the "Plan"), that was confirmed on February 15, 2017 by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, became effective on February 28, 2017 (the "Effective Date").  Terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2017.








Equity Ownership Summary
As previously disclosed, under the Plan, pre-petition holders of the Company's unsecured notes are receiving 19.0 million New Common Shares, representing 95% of the New Common Shares.  The pre-petition stockholders are receiving 1.0 million New Common Shares, or an equivalent of an approximate 1-for-5.674558 reverse stock split (or 0.176263 New Common Shares for each 1 share of Existing Shares), representing 5% of the New Common Shares.  Additionally, the pre-petition stockholders are receiving Warrants to purchase 3,529,412 New Common Shares, or approximately 3.529412 Warrants for each 1 New Common Share.  This equates to 0.622009 Warrants for each 1 Existing Share (each based on 5,674,558 Existing Shares issued and outstanding and subject to rounding).  The Warrants have an exercise price of $42.04 per share, as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Warrants, and a term of four years, unless terminated earlier by their terms upon the consummation of certain business combinations or sale transactions involving the Company.  
Each of the foregoing common equity percentages in the reorganized Company is subject to dilution from the exercise of the Warrants described above and a management incentive plan ("MIP").  Shares authorized under the MIP include 2,614,379 shares, of which the Company issued no shares on the Effective Date.  The authorized shares may be issued under the plan in the future at the discretion of the Company's board of directors.
The New Common Shares are scheduled to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "SGY" at the open of trading hours on March 1, 2017.  The Warrants will not be listed on an exchange at this time, but the Company currently expects to list the Warrants on an exchange by the end of March 2017.
Liquidity Update
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company eliminated approximately $1.2 billion in principal amount of outstanding debt, resulting in remaining debt outstanding of approximately $236.3 million, consisting of $225.0 million of 7.50% senior second lien notes due 2022, and approximately $11.3 million outstanding under a building loan.  Further, the Company had (i) no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $12.5 million under its $200 million reserve-based revolving credit facility (the "A&R Credit Facility"), with borrowing base availability thereunder of $150 million until November 1, 2017, (ii) approximately $150 million of cash on hand, and (iii) $75 million of cash held in a restricted account to satisfy near-term plugging and abandonment liabilities, pursuant to the terms of the A&R Credit Facility.
Board of Directors
Pursuant to the Plan, as of the Effective Date, the terms of the Company's previous board of directors expired and a new board of directors was appointed.  The new board of directors consists of seven members including Neal P. Goldman, John "Brad" Juneau, David Rainey, Charles M. Sledge, James M. Trimble, David N. Weinstein and David H. Welch.  
Additional Information
For additional information regarding the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, including biographical information on the Company's new board of directors, please see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed today.
Stone and its wholly-owned subsidiaries filed their voluntary chapter 11 petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston on December 14, 2016.  Information about the bankruptcy cases can be found at http://dm.epiq11.com/StoneEnergy or by calling +1-888-243-5081 (toll-free in North America) or +1-503-520-4474 (outside of North America).
Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking and are based upon Stone's current belief as to the outcome and timing of future events. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities that Stone plans, expects, believes, projects, estimates or anticipates will, should or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements herein include the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for oil and gas; operating risks; liquidity risks, including risks relating to our bank credit facility and our outstanding notes; political and regulatory developments and legislation, including developments and legislation relating to our operations in the Gulf of Mexico; and other risk factors and known trends and uncertainties as described in Stone's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  For a more detailed discussion of risk factors, please see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, Stone's actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  Stone assumes no obligation and expressly disclaims any duty to update the information contained herein except as required by law.

Gulf Of Mexico
DEEP WATER
                    The deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico have been a major focus of oil and gas exploration and production companies as early as the 1960s, and it can be argued that the Gulf of Mexico is the most prolific oil and gas producing region in the world. 
                         New oil-rich fields are being discovered year after year, propelling some recent estimates of total reserves in the Gulf to exceed 50 billion barrels.
                        
                        Though the Gulf has multiple highly promising regions that continue to be discovered, it is more 
                        technically challenging than ever before to recover these reserves which lie deep beneath the ocean and the ability to operate with commercial success in the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico is limited.  Companies must have the proven technical experience and expertise 
                        for understanding and interpreting data to identify the highest quality prospects, and they must also have access to essential capital resources for the execution of appropriate risk-weighted investments that generate the highest rates of returns.  Stone Energy Corporation 
                        is proud to be recognized as one of these companies both by the industry and investment community.
                    




Stone holds interests in over 100 lease blocks throughout the Gulf of Mexico.  Many of our prospects and projects are in the northern Mississippi Canyon and southern Viosca Knoll regions, approximately 100 miles southeast of New Orleans, LA.  
                           Our operations in this area are anchored around the Pompano and Amberjack platforms where we are executing drilling programs and flowing discovered reserves back to for processing.  We are drilling multiple other prospects in the area which also have the 
                            possibility to be flowed back to the Pompano or Amberjack platforms.  The ability to access and leverage infrastructure near deep water projects can be the determining factor when planning a deep water well.  The option to flow volumes back to these platforms 
                            provides us with a competitive advantage in this area of the Gulf. 
To see more about our operations and most recent developments in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, please visit our investor relations page for our most recent conference presentation, or click here.

DEEP GAS OPERATIONS
Throughout the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, there are large natural gas reserves approximately 15,000 to 25,000 feet below the earth’s surface.  Natural gas reserves at these depths are commonly referred to as “deep gas.” 
                         Traditional drilling methods were not sufficient to recover the reserves, however with today’s technology recovery of these reserves is not only possible, but is also an attractive investment.
In many areas onshore and of the shallow waters of the Gulf Coast region, necessary infrastructure is already in place for transport of the reserves which significantly decreases the time it takes to bring these products to market and to more quickly provide cash flows which 
    increases the rate we may receive returns.  Stone holds multiple lease interests with plans to drill potential prospects, some of which have already proved successful such as La Cantera and Tomcat.  We will continue to build and develop our deep gas drilling program inventory as we explore for additional high potential prospects.




For more detail on our deep gas operations, please visit our investor relations page for our most recent conference presentation, or  click here.
CONVENTIONAL SHELF OPERATIONS
Stone Energy maintains core properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, also known as the conventional shelf.  For many years Stone was primarily a conventional shelf production company, and as late as 2009, conventional shelf assets comprised a majority of the company’s assets. 
     The conventional shelf legacy assets provided much of the cash flows that allowed Stone to move forward in to the shale plays and deep water exploration as the company pushed itself in to high growth areas to become the company that it is today.   We have sold most of our properties in the 
    conventional shelf, and have kept only a few highly prolific projects which still produce healthy cash flows back to the company. 
Our Priority
As a Company, Stone Energy maintains a “best in class” safety performance based on industry standard metrics.  We use responsible and prudent operational practices during every phase of the well – design, drilling, completion, production maintenance and plugging and abandonment – to ensure that the 
    fluids and commodities recovered are properly handled both in the well and on the surface.  We collaborate on and stay apprised of best practices that may reduce any potential environmental risks.
