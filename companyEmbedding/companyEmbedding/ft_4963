Watertight, crushproof and dustproof, this Pelican hardware case provides complete protection for all your equipment. O-ring sealed, the case features an automatic purge valve for quick equalization after changes in atmospheric pressure. The Double-Throw latches are easy to open and tough. Your equipment can fit into the high-density "pick-n-pluck" foam for total protection against impact, vibration or shock.








Unbreakable Design The Pelican 1200 Case uses open cell core with solid wall design to make a strong yet lightweight travel case. The non-corrosive stainless steel pins securely attach the handles, latches and hinges to the body.
                            




Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve The exclusive Automatic Pressure Equalization Valve is a semi-permeable membrane, which resists water ingress and automatically releases pressure in case of atmospheric pressure changes. That makes it perfect for holding camera lenses because it will help keep them dry-preventing fungus from growing on your expensive lens.
                            




The Ultimate Protection O-ring sealed for watertight capability, the Pelican 1200 Case also includes versatile "Pick 'N' Pluck" convoluted lid foam to guard even the most fragile or sensitive equipment from damage.

Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.


  Full sets of plans only, such as PDF, 5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD, are eligible for this offer. 1-copy Sets, Study Sets, Additional Sets, Materials Lists are not eligible for this offer.

                    At nearly a mile in length, Big River Crossing is the longest public pedestrian bridge across the Mississippi River. 

Big River Crossing is also the country¿s longest active rail/bicycle/pedestrian bridge. It serves as the connection point of Main Street to Main Street, a 10-mile multi-modal corridor that also features the Delta Regional River Park and Big River Trail, creating ties to attractions between Memphis, TN and West Memphis, AR. 

No matter how you travel it, Big River Crossing provides opportunities for recreation and fitness with a whole new point of view.

                    I am a native Memphian, and I love Memphis because there are so many great things to say about the River City that I really don't know where to start; from the Mississippi River, the Pyramid, Elvis Presley, Beale Street, Orpheum Theatre (Broadway plays and musicals), Overton Park with the Memphis Zoo, one of the top zoo's in the nation, Pink Palace Museum, Children's Museum, Levitt Shell (free outdoor concerts), Brooks Art Gallery, the medical center including St. Jude, Le Bonheur and a Level 1 Trauma Center, Amtrak to New Orleans and Chicago, fabulous restaurants and the Green Line to Shelby Farms, the largest urban park in the United States.  Because I'm a native Memphian I have extensive knowledge and a wealth of information on neighborhoods, parks, communities, schools (public and private), restaurants, shopping, etc.  Please send me an email or text requesting information on whatever would interest you about Memphis, and I will reply back quickly.
