Recreation Opportunities in New York
Raymond Frobosilo Jr. 

As vice president for operations of Super Stud Building Products, Inc., Raymond Frobosilo, Jr., oversees all operations and functions related to the firm’s manufacturing process. When out of the office, Raymond Frobosilo, Jr., exercises regularly and likes to travel to upstate New York on weekends on hunting, fishing, and camping trips.
New York State has countless opportunities for camping within an hour or two’s drive from the New York City metropolitan area. One of the most well known destinations is Harriman State Park, a huge (more than 46,000 acres) preserve just 30 miles north of New York City. The park borders Bear Mountain State Park and the U.S. Miliatry Academy at West Point, and it contains hundreds of miles of hiking trails, campsites for vehicles and tents, and fishing opportunities. Parts of Harriman State Park are open to hunting in-season.
Further north are the Catskill Mountains. Home to summer resorts and wild trout streams, the Catskill Mountain Range begins quite suddenly at the Catskill Escarpment on the western side of the Hudson River from Catskill, New York, and extends in a southwesterly direction into New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania are technically a continuation of the Catskills. At the center of the range’s New York portion is Catskill Park, a forest preserve of more than 700,000 acres. All forms of summer and winter recreation activities are available in the Catskills, including canoeing, kayaking, fishing, hunting, camping, hiking, skiing, and snowboarding, among many others.





Raymond Frobosilo Jr. on the History and Popularity of the Corvette
Manufacturing 

The Chevrolet Corvette, manufactured by General Motors, is an American icon and, with nearly 60 years of history, one of the most popular sports cars ever produced. The 2012 Corvette base model’s V-8 engine produces 430 horsepower and 424 pound-feet of torque, one of the highest outputs available in the U.S. market. 
Compared to the current model, the first Corvette’s statistics in 1953 are underwhelming but were some of the best of its time. While its six-cylinder engine produced only 150 horsepower, the focus on fiberglass construction kept the Corvette’s weight down. Designed by Harley Earl to combat the popularity of foreign roadsters, Chevrolet added a V-8 option two years later and the car’s popularity began to rise. Collectors still value older models for their style and those original models, if in excellent condition, can fetch over $125,000 at auction. 
Raymond Frobosilo Jr. is an owner of a classic Corvette and Vice President of Operations for Super Stud Building Products, Inc., based in Edison, New Jersey. Frobosilo oversees the manufacturing process for the company’s metal building products.





Tips for Off-Road Driving, by Raymond Frobosilo Jr.
Manufacturing 

An enthusiastic off-road driver, Raymond Frobosilo Jr. of Super Stud Building Products enjoys sharing his interests with his colleagues as well as with friends and family. Here, Raymond Frobosilo Jr. shares a few tips for readers interested in the activity.
First, pay attention to safety. No matter how many safety features your vehicle has, always wear a seatbelt when off-roading. Travel as slowly as feels safe, and keep both feet on the pedals in case you have to change velocity quickly. Avoid wrapping your thumbs around the wheel, as hitting an obstacle may cause jerking of the wheel, which can damage or bend the thumbs.
Next, for safety as well as for enjoyment, know your path. Make a plan, and take into consideration things like potential obstacles and traction when choosing what off-roaders call your “line.” As you plan, picture your car driving the line. Can your undercarriage clear any the brush? If there are hills ahead, can you drive straight up them? Diagonal paths may cause roll-over. Keep picturing your path ahead as you drive, so you avoid having to slow down to deal with obstructions. And last, use the gears and become comfortable with engine braking so that you have as much control as possible.





“Great Barrier Reef Ideal for Novices and Skilled Divers,” by Raymond Frobosilo, Jr.
Manufacturing 

Great Barrier Reef by Tonny Watanebe
A perennial top pick by industry insiders, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia attracts scuba divers from around the globe. A certified diver, Raymond Frobosilo Jr. describes areas of the reef that are ideal for both the new and the experienced in the sport.
Michaelmas Reef – Perfect for beginning divers, this 6-mile-long reef offers a glimpse of giant clams, blue-spotted rays, and, at times, eagle rays.
Hastings Reef – Also great for new divers, this area of the reef is aptly named The Fishbowl. It teems with schools of damsel fish, angelfish, and butterfly fish, along with clams, turtles, lagoon rays, and white-tip reef sharks.
Holmes Reef – More seasoned divers may want to explore this site, which includes twin coral outcroppings, called The Matterhorn, as well as the occasional reef shark. The site also is populated by potato cod and coral shrimp.
An executive in the building industry, Raymond Frobosilo Jr. spends his leisure time diving, camping, off-roading in his Jeep, and watching baseball games during the season.





Raymond Frobosilo Jr.: The Joys and Benefits of Vegetable Gardening
Manufacturing 

Raymond Frobosilo Jr., a building products executive in Edison, New Jersey, greatly enjoys tending his garden in his spare time.
There are many advantages to growing your own vegetables. Not only can you save money and avoid toxic chemicals, but you can enjoy the convenience of having your favorite foods at hand without having to drive to the grocery store. You can grow a vegetable garden outdoors, or you can choose to establish a small one inside your kitchen. No matter which option you choose, you are sure to add a lot of healthy vitamins and minerals to your family’s diet.
If you are growing a larger outdoor garden, you might want to create separate plots for tomatoes, greens, peppers, and herbs. Larger plots may be reserved for pumpkins and zucchini squash. Of course, it all depends on what kind of vegetables you and your family like to eat.
These days, the buzzwords are “local” and “seasonal.” You cannot get much more local than a vegetable garden in your own home. Start your own garden today.





Diving the Blue Holes of the Bahamas by Raymond Frobosilo Jr.
Manufacturing 

The Bahamas’ thousands of islets, cays, and islands present winter-weary residents some of the most beautiful tropical escapes imaginable. For scuba divers, the appeal goes beyond climate and the tourist-friendly Bahamians; it is that which lies deep within the ocean waters that offers the most amazing thrills and discoveries.
The Out Islands of the Bahamas provide fascinating underwater geography, particularly its many mysterious blue holes. Named for their water’s indigo shade, blue holes are the results of collapsed ceilings of caves formed in the shallow, turquoise waters that surround the islands.
Found throughout the Bahamas, the blue holes of Andros Island are especially prolific and offer opportunities for divers of all levels, including snorkelers. Of the caves that require advanced experience, guides will lead one or two divers through narrow openings that open into underwater, cathedral-like caverns complete with stalagmites and drip stones.
Raymond R. Frobosilo Jr. is the Vice President of Operations at Super Stud Building Products, Inc. Headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, the company has been in operation for nearly 40 years. Frobosilo is a traveler and outdoorsman who holds certification in scuba diving.





Diving Wreck Valley, By Raymond Frobosilo, Jr.
Manufacturing 

Raymond Frobosilo, Jr., Vice President of Operations at Super Stud Building Products, is a certified scuba diver who lives in the New York metropolitan area.
It is a common misconception that New York is not conducive to scuba diving. Yet, for locals and tourists alike, there is a 60-mile stretch that will please any scuba diving enthusiast. Wreck Valley contains hundreds of shipwrecks lined along Long Island’s coast, through the waters of Brooklyn, and the shores of northern New Jersey.
The USS Algol was purposely sunk in 1991 for the New Jersey Artificial Reef Program. The 400-foot ship used during the Korean War and World War II is one of the most popular wrecks in Wreck Valley. It houses scallops and mussels, as well as striped bass, porgies, dog sharks, and blue sharks.
The Lizzie D is a popular site in the summertime, as it lies only eight miles from the Atlantic Beach Inlet. The ship is also known as Rum Runner, because it was holding a cargo of bootlegged whisky when it sank off of Brooklyn during the 1920s prohibition era. For years after Lizzie D sank, divers would scour the wreck in search of bottles.
Whether you are an experienced or recreational diver, most of the shipwrecks along Wreck Valley are easily accessed.

 God has blessed my life with so many miracles it is hard to recall them all.   It is my hope that as you read this book you can relate to similar situations in your past and begin to see God at work in your life.   Who knows maybe you will begin to see and understand the miracles that He has done both large and small every day of your life.   Raymond F. Banks Jr
