Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

REVENUES


 
 



Revenues for fiscal 2007 increased to $4,376.9 million, 5.4% over the $4,151.3 million generated for 
              fiscal 2006. The 


increase in revenues was primarily attributable to capacity growth, partially offset by a decrease in comparable restaurant sales.

(1) Restaurant openings includes 9 restaurants which were ultimately sold to franchisees during fiscal 2007.


 



We increased our capacity 8.2% in fiscal 2007 (as measured by average-weighted sales weeks). The 
              increase in capacity 


was due to a net increase of 117 company-owned restaurants since June 28, 2006 
  (excluding the impact of the sale of 95 Chili’s restaurants to Pepper Dining, Inc. on June 27, 2007). 
  Comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.7% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease in 
  comparable restaurant sales resulted from a decline in customer traffic at all brands and unfavorable
  product mix shifts at Chili’s and Maggiano’s. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in menu 
  prices at all brands and positive mix shift at On The Border and Macaroni Grill.


 



Revenues for fiscal 2006 increased to $4,151.3 million, 10.7% over the $3,749.5 million generated for 
              fiscal 2005. The 


increase in revenue was primarily attributable to capacity growth and an increase in 
  comparable restaurant sales.

We increased our capacity 7.2% in fiscal 2006 primarily due to a net increase of 109 company-owned 
              restaurants since 


June 29, 2005. Comparable restaurant sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2006 compared to 
  fiscal 2005 driven by increases at Chili’s and Maggiano’s partially offset by declines at Macaroni Grill and 
  On The Border. The increase in comparable restaurant sales at Chili’s and Maggiano’s resulted from 
  favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. Maggiano’s also experienced a slight increase in 
  customer traffic in fiscal 2006, while comparable restaurant sales at Chili’s were partially offset by 
  decreased traffic. The decline in comparable restaurant sales at Macaroni Grill and On The Border 
  resulted from decreases in customer traffic, partially offset by favorable product mix shifts and menu price 
  increases.




 
 


COSTS AND EXPENSES


 



Cost of sales, as a percent of revenues, decreased 0.1% in fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in menu prices at all 


brands partially offset by increased inventory costs. The cost increase was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix shifts related to the popularity of new appetizer menu items at Chili’s and premium margaritas at On The Border. Additionally, we experienced unfavorable pricing for salmon and produce. The overall cost increase was partially offset by favorable pricing for ribs and steaks. Cost of sales, as a percent of revenues, decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2006 due primarily to an increase in menu prices at all brands partially offset by increased inventory costs. The cost increase was primarily driven by an unfavorable mix shift for beef and pork and unfavorable pricing for poultry. The overall cost increase was partially offset by favorable pricing for bread and dairy and a favorable product mix shift for poultry.


 



Restaurant expenses, as a percent of revenues, increased 0.7% in fiscal 2007 primarily due to minimum wage increases, 


increases in repair and maintenance and restaurant opening expenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in labor costs due to lower incentive compensation expenses in fiscal 2007. Restaurant expenses, as a percent of revenues, decreased 0.6% in fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to a $23.3 million increase in utility and vacation costs recorded in fiscal 2005 resulting from the correction of accounting policies and a $17.3 million FICA tax assessment recorded in fiscal 2005. The
        decrease was also driven by increased sales leverage and productivity, and a reduction in repair and maintenance expenses in fiscal 2006. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation of $9.4 million and an increase in advertising expenditures.


 



Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.0 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in depreciation expense was primarily 


related to an increase in fully depreciated assets and the classification of assets as held for sale in January 2007, at which time the assets were no longer depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by new restaurant construction and ongoing remodel costs. Depreciation and amortization increased $10.3 million during fiscal 2006. The increase was due to new restaurant construction and ongoing remodel costs, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to the disposition of restaurants and a declining depreciable asset base for older restaurants.


 



General and administrative expenses decreased $12.7 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower 


than expected annual performance based compensation expense, reduced meeting expenses, and a decrease in headcount, partially offset by increased 401k matching and employee participation and increased costs for health insurance. General and administrative expenses increased $54.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was due primarily to a $23.6 million increase in performance based compensation expense, $20.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, and payroll costs resulting from an increase in headcount.


 



Other gains and charges in fiscal 2007 includes $19.1 million in gains related to the sale of companyowned restaurants to 


franchisees, including 95 Chili’s restaurants to Pepper Dining, Inc. in the fourth quarter for a $17.1 million gain. Also included is a $3.2 million gain related to the termination of interest rate swaps on an operating lease commitment. These gains were partially offset by a $12.9 million charge related to the impairment of long-lived assets at thirteen restaurants as well as lease obligation charges for seven of the restaurants that closed during fiscal 2007. The decision to close these restaurants was based on
        a comprehensive analysis that examined restaurants not meeting minimum return on investment thresholds and certain other operating performance criteria. Other gains and charges in fiscal 2006 includes gains of $15.9 million related to the sale of company-owned restaurants to franchisees and $3.3 million related to the sale of real estate. Also included is a $1.1 million gain related to the final disposition of our interest in Rockfish Seafood Grill (‘‘Rockfish’’). These gains were partially offset by
        restructure charges and other impairments of $3.1 million associated with closed restaurants and asset impairments.




 
 



Interest expense increased $8.1 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to outstanding borrowings on our new $400.0 million 


credit facility. We entered into the credit facility in April 2007 primarily to provide additional funds for our share repurchase program. Additionally, increased average borrowings and interest rates on our existing lines of credit contributed to the increase. Interest expense decreased by $2.4 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to the redemption of the convertible senior debentures in
        January 2005 and the final scheduled payment of the remaining principal balance on the senior notes in April 2005, partially offset by increased average borrowings and interest rates on our lines of credit. We expect interest expense to increase to approximately $60 million in fiscal 2008 due to the new $400.0 million credit facility, increased borrowings on other credit facilities and increased interest rates.


 



Other, net decreased $3.4 million in fiscal 2007 due to the realized gains from the liquidation of our investments in mutual 


funds and higher interest income. Other, net decreased $3.2 million in fiscal 2006 due to fully impairing our investment in Rockfish during fiscal 2005 and a decrease in expense related to our net savings plan obligations as a result of the partial termination of one of our savings plans and the distribution of $31.8 million to participants.


 


INCOME TAXES


 



The effective income tax rate related to continuing operations was 27.8%, 29.9% and 17.3% for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 


2005, respectively. The decrease in the tax rate in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to stockbased compensation expense related to the impact of incentive stock options which are not deductible until they are exercised, an income tax benefit totaling $6.8 million associated with the favorable settlement of certain tax audits and benefits from state income tax planning. The increase in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the income tax benefit of $16.9 million in fiscal 2005, consisting primarily of federal income tax
        credits related to the additional FICA taxes paid as a result of the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) resolution, the disposition of Big Bowl, which allowed us to take tax deductions for goodwill impairment charges totaling $48.6 million, and a $6.6 million tax benefit related to the correction of deferred tax liabilities as a result of an analysis of the tax basis of certain property and equipment balances in fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 was also due to stock-based compensation expense related to the impact of incentive stock options which are not deductible until they are exercised. The increase in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by an income tax benefit totaling $8.1 million associated with the favorable settlement of certain tax audits and a decrease in the effective tax rate for state income taxes.


 


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


 



Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows generated from our restaurant operations. We expect our ability to generate 


strong cash flows from operations to continue into the future. Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased to $485.0 million for fiscal 2007 from $470.5 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to increased profitability.


 



Capital expenditures consist of purchases of land for future restaurant sites, new restaurants under construction,



purchases of new and replacement restaurant furniture and equipment, and ongoing remodeling programs. Capital expenditures were $430.5 for fiscal 2007 compared to $354.6 million for fiscal 2006. We estimate that our capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 will be approximately $380 to $405 million, including new restaurant development of approximately $250 to $275 million and up to $80 million to re-image Chili’s restaurants. Our capital expenditures will be funded entirely from operations and existing credit facilities.
