Vision
In effort to help investors who seek to successfully navigate complex market conditions, we have developed investing strategies focused on proactively protecting capital while actively seeking growth.

                                The vision originated during the 1987 stock market crash. With the opinion that incurring financially devastating losses due to market volatility is unnecessary, we initiated a plan to create a strategy with the main objective to protect capital during market downturns.
                            

STRATEGY






























Strategy
Markets are constantly evolving, and investor needs have evolved, as well. By choosing to invest in a Howard Fund, you are embarking on a partnership geared towards helping you accumulate wealth, while striving to keep your capital on the safe side of the equity market. Each fund strives to:

Protect assets by leaving the market systematically in order to bypass market declines
Seeks growth in capital by investing for long-term appreciation
Active trading through a quantitative and systematic approach
Proactive management through daily monitoring and rebalancing when necessary

















HCM-BuyLine®

                                Following the 1987 stock market crash, Vance Howard, CEO of Howard Capital Management and Portfolio Manager, sought to find a proactive way to mitigate downside risk. His years of research yielded a disciplined and systematic investment process now called, the HCM-BuyLine®. The HCM-BuyLine® is an emotionless, mathematical process driven by market ratios. The Funds use the HCM-BuyLine® to determine when to be in the market and when to be out of the market.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

View (PDF)     Performance     Note: Results are based on the actual experience of the first two clients utilizing the HCM 401(k) Optimizer® program, both of whom participate in the City of Bryan, Texas’ 457 plan at ICMA-RC. These two clients, began using the HCM 401(k) Optimizer® in March 2008, adhere to the recommendations produced by the HCM 401(k) Optimizer® and gave Howard CM access to their results. Results for other users of this program are not available because HCM does not know if the participants applied the recommendations to their accounts in a timely manner. These results are presented only as an example, and are not intended to indicate that a client will achieve the same or even similar results.  View  (PDF)              Pricing During the Sign Up process, please choose your billing plan: Pro subscription - $99 recurring quarterly  OR  $389 recurring yearly Standard subscription - $23 recurring quarterly  OR  $79 recurring yearly Credit Cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover) and eChecks are accepted.

Privacy  |  Disclosure  |  Form ADV Part 2

                        The 401(k) Optimizer® is offered through Howard Capital Management (HCM), an SEC-registered investment adviser which only does business where it is 
                        properly registered or is otherwise exempt from registration. SEC registration does not constitute an endorsement of the firm by the Commission nor does it 
                        indicate that the adviser has attained a particular level of skill or ability. The firm may make investment decisions that are inconsistent with the information 
                        provided herein. Stoploss protection will not necessarily contain your losses in the desired amounts due to the tool's limitations, market conditions, and delays 
                        in executing orders. It is not an actual stoploss order that automatically sells securities in the portfolio at a certain price. All investment strategies have 
                        the potential for profit or loss. Asset allocation and diversification do not assure or guarantee better performance and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses.
                        The 401(k) Optimizer® is a web-based tool intended to help clients invest in their employer's 401(k) or similar defined contribution plan. Clients receive professional 
                        recommendations from Howard Capital Management, Inc. and maintain total control over their personal accounts. The goal is to reduce risk by taking proactive measures with 
                        company-sponsored retirement plans. 
                        

                                Changes in investment strategies, contributions or withdrawals may materially alter the performance, strategy and results of your portfolio. 
                                Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment (including the investments 
                                and/or investment strategies recommended by the advisors), will either be suitable or profitable for client's investment portfolio. Past performance 
                                does not guarantee future results.  All investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss. Economic factors, market conditions, and investment 
                                strategies will affect the performance of any portfolio and there are no assurances that it will match or outperform any particular benchmark for measuring 
                                the performance of a portfolio.
                            


                        Please work with your financial advisor to determine which investment program is consistent with your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Fees and costs are disclosed in 
                        Form ADV Part 2 and the 401(k) Optimizer® Program Agreement. Please refer to those documents for any questions.  This material has been distributed for informational purposes
