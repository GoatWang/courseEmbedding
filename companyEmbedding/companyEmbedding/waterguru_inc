The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

WaterGuru





































Meet WaterGuru.








The only smart poolside device that automatically tests and treats pool water—every day.










WaterGuru doesn’t just skim the surface.


It fits on top of your pool skimmer to monitor pH and chlorine with a patented sensor. Then it treats your pool for you by automatically dispensing the right amount of balancing agents.

Safe, clean water is a system of checks and balances.






pH








Chlorine










WaterGuru automatically maintains daily pH and chlorine levels to keep your pool from losing its balance. And precise water balance means your pool stays consistently clean, clear and safe.

See How it Works
















Smart homes deserve smart pools.

Because WaterGuru is smart enough to take care of itself, it fits seamlessly into your smart home ecosystem. Glance at your phone to see it in action and get the status of your pool in real time. 

Learn about the App














Avoid sticker shock with daily maintenance.

WaterGuru automatically measures and adjusts pool chemistry, so you can feel good knowing your pool is being treated with the least amount of chemicals. Because you only use what you need, you don’t have to buy expensive extra chemicals to recover bad water or pay for service to restore an imbalanced pool.

Reserve Your WaterGuru
See How it Works








Pool chores shouldn't get in the way of fun.

WaterGuru automates everyday pool maintenance, so every pool moment is joy. Depending on conditions, WaterGuru can maintain an average 18,000-gallon pool for up to 30 days without needing a refill. (We like to think of it as a care-free pool.) 

See How it Works
View Costs & Usage












No hassles, more splashing around.

WaterGuru is easy to install yourself and comes equipped with everything you need to treat your pool for 30 days or longer. Because every moment you spend thinking about your pool should be how best to enjoy it.
