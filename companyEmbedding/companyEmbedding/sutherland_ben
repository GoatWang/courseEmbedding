About Sutherland







Organically Delicious Fruit
Organically delicious is not just another marketing tagline. It’s a commitment. A commitment that began even before there was a Sutherland Produce. It began when Bill Sutherland first discovered and tasted the organic difference almost 40 years ago. After a decade in the field, Sutherland Produce was founded on a commitment to deliver fresh from farm to kitchen the best tasting organically grown fruit from top organic growers in the West. Growers, most with Sutherland since the beginning, who share in this commitment to consistently provide the finest organic fruit possible, while maintaining the strictest organic standards and the highest regard for a sustainable environment. 
Organically delicious…it’s what your customers deserve and what makes Sutherland Produce your source for top-quality, organic produce.

Organically Delicious Vegetables
Fresh, nutritious and organically delicious. That’s what you can expect every time from Sutherland Produce and its quality growers. Like all of our produce, our commitment to delivering the best tasting organically grown vegetables is a commitment we don’t take lightly. It’s a commitment and tradition that Sutherland, the man, industry pioneer and successful company, has stood for since the very beginning, almost 40 years ago. We pride ourselves on representing only the best growers who have proven themselves over the years to grow and consistently deliver the finest-tasting organic vegetables at fair and reasonable prices, enabling them to maintain best practices in environmentally responsible farming. 
Organically delicious…it’s what your customers deserve and what makes Sutherland Produce your source for top-quality, organic produce.

Organically Certified Growers
Since 1977, Bill Sutherland has played an active role in helping define, shape and establish the standards of organic farming. So when he founded Sutherland Produce in 1987, he understood the importance of representing only the best quality growers. They would need to share his commitment for producing the best-tasting, nutritiously delicious organic produce, while adhering to the strictest sustainable agricultural standards that he and other pioneers worked so hard to establish. He would consider his growers true partners, working with them to deliver consistent quality and value from farm to table. As a result, both Sutherland and its growers would prosper, and in very short order, the company would earn the prestigious “XXXX” Blue Book rating. 
Today, Sutherland Produce represents organically certified growers, many from the company’s first days, throughout California, the Pacific Northwest and Mexico.

Talking to children about terrorism
close

The recent terrorist attacks in London following on from the recent 
events in Manchester, where children and young people were among the 
victims, has spread shockwaves across the globe. With media coverage 
reaching saturation levels it’s difficult to shield children from these 
events. The task for parents is to reassure children, while to trying to
 explain events that for most of us are inexplicable.
While most parents quiet naturally don’t want to discuss terrorism 
with children, it’s not a topic that you should avoid, particularly if 
your children ask pertinent questions.
Here are some ideas that will help:
1. Discuss age-appropriately
The Australian Psychological Society recommends, “It’s best to shield
 pre-schoolers completely from frightening or traumatic world events.” 
This means protecting young children from media coverage and being 
mindful of adult conversations around young children. However even young
 children overhear conversations and know is happening, so be prepared 
to discuss events in ways that they understand.
Primary school-aged children have more exposure through the media and
 the schoolyard. However children can easily misinterpret events so be 
prepared to clarify misconceptions and open the way for conversations.To read the full article, CLICK HERE

This was a great result.3.  What are the benefits to the business in participating in the program? As a Not Fort Profit Organisation, Vision Australia rely on volunteers to keep the staff costs down.  To have a regular flow of helpers coming in is a great benefit.  Other branches around Australia have made comment of how great it is the the Enfield branch has so many younger volunteers, which is due to the Student Workplace Learning program.Thank you to Rolf Geerlings and the wonderful team for being to welcoming and supportive to all the students, and we look forward to continuing our partnership in the years to come.For more information on donating or volunteering with Vision Australia please visit the website http://www.visionaustralia.org/
