Robert Propst




What do a vertical timber harvester, a quality control system for concrete, an electronic tagging system for livestock, a mobile office for a quadriplegic lawyer, and Herman Miller's Action Office System have in common? They were all invented by Robert Propst.

While his inventions may seem unrelated, they all spring from the same source: his relentless need to investigate how the world operates and then find fresh answers. Propst wasn't interested in creating individual "things" that have no impact on complex situations. Instead, he researched big issues and focused on developing new, large-scale systems that improve and simplify people's lives.

A native of Colorado, Propst began his career in the late 1940s as a graphic artist, teacher, and sculptor. In 1953, he formed the Propst Co., a Denver-based firm specializing in speculative product development. In other words, Propst drew on his independent nature and impatience with the status quo to attack problems, whether anyone asked him to or not. He called on Herman Miller with one of those speculative developments—a unique fishbone connection system for furniture components. Propst then signed on as a Herman Miller consultant and began conducting unprecedented studies of people in work situations as a basis for extending the company's line of products.

In 1960, Propst became president of Herman Miller Research Corp., where he continued investigating how the world of work operates, concluding that "today's office is a wasteland. It saps vitality, blocks talent, frustrates accomplishment. It is the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort."

Propst's answer to this unhappy situation was introduced by Herman Miller in 1968. The Action Office system was the world's first open-plan office system of reconfigurable components and a bold departure from the era's fixed assumptions of what office furniture should be. With the Action Office system, Propst assailed traditional, complacent office design with a concept that fit the way people really work. Wildly successful, the Action Office system transformed the workplace, as well as Herman Miller and the entire furniture industry, which scrambled to copy it.

In the early 1960s, Propst also initiated research into the troubled state of patient care delivery in hospitals. As usual, he came up with a revolutionary solution, introduced in 1971 by Herman Miller. The Co/Struc system streamlined hospital services with mobile and modular containers, carts, frames, and rails.

With over 120 patents under his belt, Propst continued his relentless investigations until his death in 2000.

																					Herman took such amazing professional photos of me!  He made me look flawless and I now use that photo on a number of professional websites and blogs.  He knows which angles are your best and also provides a number of good shots to choose from.  He is very professional and is a pleasure to work with!  I recommend him to anyone who wants a business photo done right.
																				






15.Guillaume Mpacko(non-registered)


																					Herman was recommended to me for the quality of his work, as I needed to update my picture for LinkedIn. I was very happy with his efficiency and the results. I particularly liked his suggestions for trying out different outfits and poses. That gave me lots of excellent options to choose from. I highly recommend him.
																				






13.Chris Ruud(non-registered)


																					The session was quick painless and Herman was a pleasure to talk to.
																				






12.Sarah Cleaver(non-registered)


																					I hate getting my picture taken, but within a couple of minutes of being around Herman, my apprehension lessened considerably.  My picture looks great, and he managed to get to smile with my eyes open.  Not many have been able to accomplish this task.
																				






11.Marci Jeary(non-registered)


																					For a person that hates getting their picture taken, this was an amazing experience.  Herman made me feel comfortable as soon as I walked thru the door.  The pictures exceeded my expectation and I am very happy to be able to use on my social media sites.  Thank you for making me look so good.

															Herman took such amazing professional photos of me!  He made me look flawless and I now use that photo on a number of professional websites and blogs.  He knows which angles are your best and also provides a number of good shots to choose from.  He is very professional and is a pleasure to work with!  I recommend him to anyone who wants a business photo done right.
														






15.Guillaume Mpacko(non-registered)


															Herman was recommended to me for the quality of his work, as I needed to update my picture for LinkedIn. I was very happy with his efficiency and the results. I particularly liked his suggestions for trying out different outfits and poses. That gave me lots of excellent options to choose from. I highly recommend him.
														






13.Chris Ruud(non-registered)


															The session was quick painless and Herman was a pleasure to talk to.
														






12.Sarah Cleaver(non-registered)


															I hate getting my picture taken, but within a couple of minutes of being around Herman, my apprehension lessened considerably.  My picture looks great, and he managed to get to smile with my eyes open.  Not many have been able to accomplish this task.
														






11.Marci Jeary(non-registered)


															For a person that hates getting their picture taken, this was an amazing experience.  Herman made me feel comfortable as soon as I walked thru the door.  The pictures exceeded my expectation and I am very happy to be able to use on my social media sites.  Thank you for making me look so good.
														






10.A & A(non-registered)


															Herman did our recent family photos and we were completely happy with the location and experience of the session & well as the amazing photos that came from it. We used several for our family Christmas card and got countless compliments from friends and family. He was quite patient with our little guy and captured great shots from a baby who never sits still. Products were delivered on time and as promised. Herman is the very definition of a pro in our family opinion. Thanks!
														






9.N Jan Chalupny(non-registered)


															I recently worked with Herman to get a professional photo to post on my LinkedIn profile.  He was very enjoyable to work with.  The session was quick and friendly.  My photos turned out so well that I purchased a second photo from him.  I have gotten numerous compliments on the photo that I used for my LinkedIn profile.  I would highly recommend him.
														






8.Joanna Sharpe(non-registered)


															Herman is an exceptionally talented photographer that I worked with recently to secure a LinkedIn profile photo. He was great to work with - very thoughtful, friendly and creative. He made this photo session a very positive productive experience. I highly recommend him for your photography needs. Herman is the best!
														






7.Carol Huddleston(non-registered)


															I immediately saw an increase in profile lookups after I posted the photo that Robert created for me for my LinkedIn profile.    I absolutely HATE sitting for photos but Robert made me feel at ease.
														






6.James Klinkam(non-registered)


															Herman was very organized and easy to work with when he took a professional headshot photograph for me.  He was very helpful and responsive.  The processing that he did on the picture that I selected to use came out great.  I definitely recommend him and his work.
