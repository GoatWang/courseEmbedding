As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

  × Accredited Investor 
What does it mean to be an accredited investor?
Under the federal securities laws, a company or private fund may not offer or sell securities unless the transaction has been registered with the SEC or an exemption from registration is available. Certain securities offerings that are exempt from registration may only be offered to, or purchased by, persons who are accredited investors. One principal purpose of the accredited investor concept is to identify persons who can bear the economic risk of investing in these unregistered securities.
Unlike offerings registered with the SEC in which certain information  is required to be disclosed, companies and private funds, such as a hedge fund or venture capital fund, engaging in these exempt offerings do not have to make prescribed disclosures to accredited investors. These offerings, sometimes referred to as private placements, involve unique risks and you should be aware that you could lose your entire investment.
The SEC recently adopted rules to permit general advertising for certain exempt offerings.

		Are you an accredited investor?
An accredited investor, in the context of a natural person, includes anyone who:


			earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, OR

			has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of the person’s primary residence).

On the income test, the person must satisfy the thresholds for the three years consistently either alone or with a spouse, and cannot, for example, satisfy one year based on individual income and the next two years based on joint income with a spouse. The only exception is if a person is married within this period, in which case the person may satisfy the threshold on the basis of joint income for the years during which the person was married and on the basis of individual income for the other years.
In addition, entities such as banks, partnerships, corporations, nonprofits and trusts may be accredited investors. Of the entities that would be considered accredited investors and depending on your circumstances, the following may be relevant to you:

 any trust, with total assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to specifically purchase the subject securities, whose purchase is directed by a sophisticated person,  or
 any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors.

In this context, a sophisticated person  means the person must have, or the company or private fund offering the securities reasonably believes that this person has, sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks of the prospective investment.

  × Accredited Investor 
What does it mean to be an accredited investor?
Under the federal securities laws, a company or private fund may not offer or sell securities unless the transaction has been registered with the SEC or an exemption from registration is available. Certain securities offerings that are exempt from registration may only be offered to, or purchased by, persons who are accredited investors. One principal purpose of the accredited investor concept is to identify persons who can bear the economic risk of investing in these unregistered securities.
Unlike offerings registered with the SEC in which certain information  is required to be disclosed, companies and private funds, such as a hedge fund or venture capital fund, engaging in these exempt offerings do not have to make prescribed disclosures to accredited investors. These offerings, sometimes referred to as private placements, involve unique risks and you should be aware that you could lose your entire investment.
The SEC recently adopted rules to permit general advertising for certain exempt offerings.

		Are you an accredited investor?
An accredited investor, in the context of a natural person, includes anyone who:


			earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, OR

			has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of the person’s primary residence).

On the income test, the person must satisfy the thresholds for the three years consistently either alone or with a spouse, and cannot, for example, satisfy one year based on individual income and the next two years based on joint income with a spouse. The only exception is if a person is married within this period, in which case the person may satisfy the threshold on the basis of joint income for the years during which the person was married and on the basis of individual income for the other years.
In addition, entities such as banks, partnerships, corporations, nonprofits and trusts may be accredited investors. Of the entities that would be considered accredited investors and depending on your circumstances, the following may be relevant to you:

 any trust, with total assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to specifically purchase the subject securities, whose purchase is directed by a sophisticated person,  or
 any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors.

In this context, a sophisticated person  means the person must have, or the company or private fund offering the securities reasonably believes that this person has, sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks of the prospective investment.

CEO Letter


 
Dear Grow Condo (OTC: GRWC) Shareholders,
The New Year is often a time of earnest reflection on the developments of last year and ambitious goal-setting for the year ahead. I am pleased to say that 2015 was a year of transformation and tremendous progress for the Company in our last quarter in terms of uniquely positioning the company and the brand long term.
I would first like to thank all of the shareholders for their continued support with the Company. We greatly appreciate the trust you have placed in Grow Condo’s operations, management, and mission. As we move forward, we will strive to capitalize on our momentum and create increased shareholder value for this new dynamic and potentially highly lucrative industry for our shareholders, partners and associates. We look forward to 2016 and 2017 to be key years in the developing of Grow Condos in an industry leader in the specialty of real estate, tools and education for the marijuana industry
Industry Outlook
The legal marijuana industry has never looked better with many experts already labeling it as the fastest growing industry in the Country and if the trend toward legalization spreads to all 50 states, marijuana could become larger than the organic food industry. Industry experts estimate U.S. market for legal cannabis grew 74 percent in 2014 to $2.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2013. Additionally, over the next five years, the marijuana industry is expected to continue to grow, with an estimated 14 more states will legalize recreational marijuana and two more states will legalize medical marijuana.
It is estimated by The ArcView Group publisher of the 3rd Edition of the State of Legal Marijuana Markets, that by 2019, all of the state-legal marijuana markets combined will make for a potential overall market worth almost $11 billion annually. California still has the largest legal medical cannabis market in the U.S., at $1.3 billion. Arizona was found to have the fastest-growing major marijuana market in 2014, expanding to $155 million, up more than $120 million from the previous year. Medical marijuana is already legal in Arizona and California and recreational legalization measures are likely to appear on the 2016 ballots in both states.
More than 1.5 million shoppers purchased legal marijuana from a dispensary, either medical or recreational, in 2014. Five states now boast marijuana markets that are larger than $100 million, and in Colorado and Washington — the first states to open retail marijuana shops in the U.S. — consumers bought $370 million in marijuana products last year. Oregon and Alaska are expected to add a combined $275 million in retail marijuana sales in their first year of operation, the report projects.
The huge growth potential of the industry appears to be limited only by the possibility of states rejecting the loosening of their drug laws. If the legalization trend continues to the point that all 50 states legalize recreational marijuana, the total market value of all states legalizing marijuana would top $36.8 billion — more than $3 billion larger than the organic food industry.
Significant Achievements 2015
1) Recapitalize the company’s stock and positioning for the Investment community. By completing the reverse stock split of 20/1 while maintaining our fully reporting status it uniquely positions us to be attractive within the investment and acquisition community
2) Developed financial models for Industrial condo sales and marketing.
3) Identify strategic management and advisors
4) Target development properties for acquisition and build out
Overview 2016 goals and milestones
The current year is expected to be a busy year of development and expansion of our multi pronged real estate company catering to the marijuana industry. Our plan for the year is the build out of the following in the hopes of building a dynamic company that is uniquely positioned for this exploding industry.
1) Expansion of new industrial condo projects: We plan to close and begin development of additional properties to compliment our 15 unit property in Eugene. Plans call to then market these individual customized condo units to the marijuana growing community
2) Broadening management team and advisors: As the company matures we recognize the need to have our management team broadened and to have specific proven backgrounds that can help build out the company for the primetime marketplace. The company is currently interviewing an exciting team to begin announcing shortly
3) Launch and close private placement memorandum for $2.5 million ($15 million fully diluted): The Company will require sufficient capital to deploy for the build out and the management of these properties and plans call for the announcement of a proposed private placement shortly.
4) Develop strategic partners and joint ventures for the implementation of our educational line: The marijuana growing community is uniquely specialized as it relates to real estate. Each unit is customized to the specific needs of the owner. Grow Condos is developing unique educational and procedural tools to satisfy the demand for new and up and coming growers.
Yours truly,
Wayne

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
