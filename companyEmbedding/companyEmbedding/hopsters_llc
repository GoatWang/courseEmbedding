Story








Hopsters is the vision of local husband-and-wife (and craft beer-lovers) Lee and Karen Cooper, coming to life.
Growing up in Liverpool, England, Lee was no stranger to good beer. When he came to the US in 1996, he missed the cask ales and other beer varieties he’d known and loved in the UK. Eventually, he began brewing his own beer at home, and before long, he’d gone from novice to passionate craft beer aficionado.
Leaving his career in corporate learning and development behind, Lee decided to make the leap and create the kind of craft beer “space” he’d been looking for – a community brewery that brings people together to experiment and create unique craft beers, and learn more about brewing beer in general. And most importantly, enjoy yourself in the process!
The Beer Adventure Starts Here …Check out this Clip on the Hopsters Experience

Our equipment is state-of-the art and whatever your taste, you can rest assured that any beer brewed at Hopsters will be hand-crafted, all-natural and made with locally-sourced ingredients. We’ve partnered with local food producers for all of our ingredients and charcuterie meats  and make a point of supporting local businesses and other craft breweries.

Most of all, we’re about having fun! Handcrafting beer is a bit of science and a lot of art, so whether you come in with a large group or a smaller circle of friends, we want to create an atmosphere that makes you want to hang out, learn and have fun. Simply put, we want to be the center for craft beer awareness in Boston.

Why I Like Hopsters



Although I’d always been a craft beer lover, I had never seen such a unique and engaging business model in the craft beer space.  Sure, there are a lot of great craft beers, a lot of cool brew pubs that serve good food and even a few places where you can brew your own beer.  But Hopster’s was bringing this all together, uniting craft beer and the community like it has never been done before!Concept is one thing.  Successful execution is another.  Being a true believer, I invested both money and time.  For seven months, I worked alongside Lee and Karen to get Hopster’s up and running – taking it from a pre-renovation cool concept to an insanely successful business.  Hopster’s continued success results from a carefully managed business fueled by talented and fun loving staff, all with a passion for sharing a truly unique craft beer experience.  Add in their awesome beer and delicious food and you just can’t go wrong.

THE BUZZ ABOUT HOPSTERS




I think Hopster's is a unique, differentiated and highly scalable restaurant concept.

Excellent knowledgeable staff. Cool spot with great food and some really well made and thought out beers. Looking forward to going back.

We Want to Be the First Brew-it-Yourself Franchise
We rolled up a craft brewery, restaurant, and brew-it-yourself event space into one.

We first opened doors in Newton, MA in Fall of 2013. Since then, we've breached the $1 million sales wall, brewed over 21,000 batches of custom beer, and have served corporate customers like Google, John Hancock, and more. We think it's safe to say we've nailed down the 
  business model of your all-in-one craft brewery. 






Brewery

We brew Hopster-branded craft beers which reward us with 95% gross margins on every sale.             



Restaurant

Hopsters also provides gourmet, farm-to-table meals for customers wanting more than a drink.            



Brew-it-Yourself

We're one of the only DIY breweries that lets you mix, brew—and even design—your own beer.            





In 2015, We Made $1.2 Million
With a single 2,000 sqft location, we nearly doubled our sales annually.

In Newton alone, a suburban city with a population of 88,000, we've doubled sales nearly every year since opening. Our revenue model, which combines several different verticals—corporate events, craft brewing, food, DIY kettles—separates us from the crowd of other craft breweries.

Now, We Want to Conquer Boston
We've nailed down a 5,000 sqft location in Boston's booming Seaport district.

As one of the epicenters of the craft beer movement and a population 7x that of Newton's, we're ready to take over Beantown. We've already signed a lease for a location in Boston's premier Seaport district, will start construction later this year, and aim to open Spring 2017.  













We Plan to Double Our Sales from Corporate Events in 2017
The Seaport district is the perfect location to host corporate events. We've already worked with some of the biggest brands.

Earlier this year, we held an event with 50+ John Hancock employees. At $125/a head we made over $10,000 in sales in just three hours.
    Corporate events are a lucrative opportunity for us—especially in a larger Boston space, where we can keep the entire brewpub open, even with the event space sectioned off.

Your investment will help us buy remaining equipment and open our taproom to beer-thirsty Bostonians.

Let's Build Something Huge
We opened Hopsters 3 years ago because we care deeply about craft beer and the role it plays in our community.







Hopsters, and our team, work every day to grow the awareness and enhance people's experience with craft beer.  As you know, we are expanding into the downtown Boston Seaport area, and I wanted to take some time to share with you our thoughts and feelings about Hopsters        

Since we opened in 2013 we have had 22,000 guests brew beer with us.  Some of our guests are experienced home brewers, the vast majority are not, however they have all taken away an experience that enhances their connection with their community and local craft beer. 
        

Hopsters is brew pub, a restaurant and a place where you can experience craft beer to the fullest.  Many people just pull up to the bar, chat with our welcoming staff, have a bite to eat and enjoy our house brewed beer.   Everyone is curious about the beer making experience and many come back to try it either with friends or with colleagues as part of a corporate event.         

If you love craft beer, you love Hopsters.  Everyone that visits us, especially our guests that participate in the beer making experience, have a big smile of their face.   It’s so much fun, with a glass of beer in hand, to get the malts, Hops and grains and mix it all up in the kettle, knowing that in two weeks you get to come back to bottle, label and drink your hand crafted beer.         


We’ve hosted hundreds of 40th birthday parties (in-fact we have one going on upstairs as I’m writing this), corporate events, wedding rehearsal dinners, community sports teams along with teachers group outings.  In fact, if you think of a reason to get together with friends, Hopsters has probably hosted it. 
      

I truly believe there will be a Hopsters in most major cities in the US in the coming years.  Our mission, why we get out of bed in the mornings, is to increase people’s awareness of craft beer.  We value and care about learning, so you make the best most informed choices.  To this aim we have made it a priority to support our community to enhance the place we live by supporting fundraising for local schools and initiatives.  We keep our attention local, because beer is best when it’s brewed in your community and on fun, because life is crazy - beer shouldn’t be.       

I’m asking you to invest in your community, support local produced products, learn about craft beer and have some fun along the way.  To this aim we are excited to announce that we will be opening in the Spring a Hopsters in the downtown Boston Seaport area.  Hopsters in its three short years has become a phenomenal success, way beyond our hopes.  Because we have stuck to our mission, the financial rewards have come too and we want to pass those rewards onto you, our stake holders and friends; the people that have supported us by their patronage, feedback and moral support.  The process has been, and is a blast, however the proceeds have been pretty good too and we want to share that with you.
      

            Much love,

                  What is Hopsters?
                  



Hopsters is unique experience. You could probably call us a brew your own beer brew pub. What that means is you come in, we ask you what beer you like to drink then we help you make 3 cases of your own handcrafted beer. It takes about 2 hours. It's a fun experience. You can do it with friends, as a corporate group, team building or by yourself. During those 2 hours when you are brewing we have a full restaurant, so you can eat and drink while you are making your own beer.



                  How did Hopsters get its start?
                  



I was looking for a new career and I was interested in owning my own business. I was making my own homebrewed beer and I got rave reviews so I always thought it would be fun to have a career that involves beer in some way. I never really thought that was going to happen because I did a little bit of research and quite frankly unless you have a significant amount of up front capital it's very difficult to run a brewery that makes any significant amount of cash. With two kids, a family, and living in the suburbs, I needed to create a significant income for myself. I didn’t think that owning a brewery with the vast amount of capital was going to make the money that I need to be successful. I also didn't have a lot of experience putting together a commercial brewery. On my travels I found these places that you can go and brew your own beer. I visited one with some friends of mine, and as we were going through the experience of brewing our own beer we came to the conclusion that it was great to be able to brew your own beer and get to hang out with other people during the process. With the downtime while you wait for the beer to brew, we thought it would be great if the place had a restaurant so we could eat while we waited. That was really the start of the genesis of the business. After looking into the numbers I realized you could actually make some serious money doing this. It’s fun to have a restaurant and a bar and a brewing aspect. I did more research and found that there are only two places that that did this; both in Ohio, one in Columbus and one just outside Columbus, Ohio. I didn't really find anything else around that. I had a few ideas that focused on the beer making piece of it. The places that I visited seemed to want to be a bar and a brewery, but they weren’t focused on the brewery aspect, and used kettles twice the size as we use. With them you brew six cases of beer and for a lot of people that is too much; our concept uses a smaller kettle and allows you to brew three cases. Another thing I noticed is that these places were dingy and more like a warehouse type of setting. I realized that the demographic that was into craft beer was young professionals who are looking for an upscale experience. Along with using less beer in the kettles, we decided to provide a really fun, cool, upscale environment that catered to young urban professionals who were really moving and embracing the whole craft beer movement...That’s the of the idea for this concept. After about a year or so we decided that we wanted to really brew our own beer and become a brewpub. So we got a brewpub license and we have pretty much been exclusively offering our beer at Hopsters for the last year. We wanted to be authentic, and if we were going to have others brew their own beer, we wanted to be known as a place that produces great beer.



                  What is Hopsters’ Mission, and what are your core values?
                  



Our mission is to enhance craft beer awareness for people in our community. We want them know more about craft beer; whether it's tasting, brewing, we want people to experience and we want to enhance their experience for craft beer.  That is what we get out of bed every morning to do. I have to say that Hopsters offers the best craft beer experience in the States right now.  We also value the learning process, so when people come in, they can learn as much as they want. They can totally immerse themselves or just ask a couple of questions, all while enjoying   the great selection of beer and menu items that we have in our restaurant. It’s a complete experience that they can enjoy. We like to call the learning process self-directed edutainment.

The craft beer culture can sometimes get a little snobby, much like the wine culture, and  we wanted to take that whole snobbishness out of beer. Where I grew up in England, beer is a working man's drink and we want to create that easy going, fun, relaxing environment.

We have four core  values. The first three are learning, keeping local, and community involvement. We really want to be involved in our community. Even if we can’t give a lot of money within the community, we do like to donate kettles so that they can auction them out for community charities. We are able to do that for not a lot of money, so we do a significant amount of charity work within the community. Being a part of the community is very important to us. Craft beer if anything is local. People want to drink local fresh beer. Most people don't want their beer to come from 4000 miles away if given the choice.

The last value that we have is for the locals is fun.  So we really try to provide a culture around beer that is fun and let's people get away from their day to day life. We really feel that we've been able to bring those four aspects together because people are always having fun. They are drinking and making beer. Everyone that comes into Hopsters just has a really good time.

By asking the community to put money into this fundraiser, we are giving our community a piece of Hopsters. They will have a stake in the business and can come to Hopsters, drink a beer, and say, “I own a piece of this!” It’s a circle of support, in a way. We support the community that will be supporting us.




                  What is the experience when someone comes into Hopsters? What is the process?
                  



Our system has 10 kettles that are all connected; you can brew one kettle, which most people do, or you can come in with some friends and do 2 or 3 or 4 kettles. Each kettle is a different style of beer. When you come in you will be assigned a brewmaster and a number of our staff and they will help choose the kind of beer that you would like to brew; that is usually a quick 2 minute conversation. We have a whole selection of 30 different recipes that we have developed over the years of 30 different styles of beer. If you have a little bit of experience and you want to customize the beer with maybe different hop choices or certain things you'd like to add to the beer, as long as we have those ingredients and it's not going to make your beer taste awful, we are happy to accommodate that. We offer a “flight of beers” that you can order to taste so you can get accustomed to the different flavor and different styles of beer if you are not a big craft beer drinker. For example, you may want to sample a Belgian beer because you have never had it. You can get a sample and that will help you to fine tune your beer choice. Once you've chosen a beer to brew, we take you to our ingredients room. We have canisters on the wall where you get your different types of grains. You will choose your hops and the various malts that go into your beer. In fact, you will get a laminated recipe card and the brewmaster will help you select those different types of ingredients. Once you have all the ingredients that you need for the brew, you will go over to your kettle and start making your three cases of beer, which is about 7.5 gallons of beer. You get 72 12oz. bottles or you can mix and match of bottles and cans. Our cans are 32oz. (2 pints). If you are making a big strong Belgian ale, you probably don't want to can that, so you will probably fill up bottles when they come back later. The process takes about 2 hours and moves in sections. The first section, selecting the beer, getting the ingredients, etc., takes up to about 30 minutes. Then, you will be boiling the beer for about an hour; which is when we will be keeping an eye on your beer. There may be times during that hour where you need add hops or some other adjuncts into the beer; if you are making spice beer you might be putting some cloves in, or if you’re making a pumpkin beer, you put in pumpkin. For the most part, you have about 45 minutes of down time, and in that time we encourage you to order some food from the restaurant and get yourself a beer. Then you will go over to the kettles and we are going to transfer that beer into your fermenter, which takes about 10 minutes. What we are basically doing is taking your kettle of beer and we are getting it down to room temperature through the heat exchanger. It’s a fancy bit of equipment in the brewery, and it’s really easy to do; we kind of walk you through that process. The fermenter is a 15 gallon drum. Once you've filled up your beer you are going to add the yeast into your beer.That is when we get some details from you to tie down your beer and take it downstairs to our fermentation room. The beer takes about a week to ferment. At this point you can either keep drinking and having fun at Hopsters, or go home. When you come back two weeks later, you get to try out the beer that you brewed. The great thing is that, with all of our recipes and our processes, the beer is going to be pretty good; a lot better than if you were going to homebrew for the first time. People are usually quite pleased with the beer that they get. At this point, you get to bottle your beer in the bottling line. There you sanitize your bottles and fill them through our bottling machines. Once again, you go home and that is when we send you an email with a link to our site where you can upload the design you would like for your labels. It is all included in the price. When you come back to get your beer, you will get to place your 72 labels onto your beer, and people have a lot of fun with that. Basically that's it. Once you've bottled your beer it's good to drink so you take it home and drink it.



                  How much does the process cost? What is the split in the cost between the restaurant, the bar and the brewing experience?
                  



It costs anywhere from $180 to $230, depending on the style of beer that you want. A pale ale is $180 and a Belgian trippel is $230. That price difference is for the ingredients; you need more product to get stronger beers, and more hops to get hoppier beer. If you are coming as a corporate group, you are going to pay $125 per person. For that price, we bottle the beers for you, we stick the labels on it and we drop it off at your company address for you to give to the people.






                  What are your margins?
                  



We are coming in around 20% net profit. We have an 76% gross margin.




                  How has the growth progressed, and what is the ceiling on a location of that size?
                  



The Newton location is a 2,000 sq ft location and our sales ar not really going to grow significantly in Newton, we are maxed out, we did 1.2M in 2015 and looks like we'll do close to 1.4M this year. We are closed on Mondays, and don’t open for lunch, so we could change that, but would still only increase revenues a small portion. One thing that is pretty low is our salary. Our salary comes in around 20% which in most restaurants is in the 30's, especially for the check average that we have. People here spend what they would spend at a fine dining restaurant; checks, on average, are around $120. When someone brews, obviously the check is much higher.




                  How have your priorities and goals evolved over the years at Hopsters?
                  



The first year in our business we wondered if it was going to work and if the concept was viable. We had done a significant amount of sales and had a lot of fun and spent a lot of money. The second year of business, 2015, was really about sales. We looked at our product differentiation, our pricing, and focusing on the restaurant and brewing our own beer. We thought about how to drive sales. We knew we worked, because people wanted to come to Hopsters. Our new focus was on finding ways to get more people to come into Hopsters and ultimately increase the cost of the average check. The third year has really about sales and foot traffic and how to manage the cost of goods. We want to lower cost of goods. We also have been looking at how to consolidate.  2016 has really been about focusing on a couple things. One has really been working on the P&L and cutting costs. Being effective with labor costs, and really driving in on managing that to have a strong P&L, whereby we are not wasting money or spending money on things vision. That's what this is, and what we've been all about. We have also been spending time on the expansion.



                  Why did you choose Newton for your location? What is next for you in terms of growth?
                  



No one had done this on the east coast, New England, and we've been the first people to do that. We wanted a place that was affordable and that had good visibility on a main road, so people could see it. You are never going to be successful doing something like this in the back alley. The Hopsters brewery in Newton, we've only got 3000 sq ft. One of the biggest challenges is that, we had 3 corporate groups this week, generating revenue anywhere from $4,000 to $9,000 dollars. For a 2,000 sq ft location, that is a significant amount of money. However, because it is so small, we had to shut down to the public. We also often receive calls from people saying, "We want to come in with 40 of my friends. We love your brewpub and we love your food. We really want to celebrate an occasion here but we are not really interested in brewing." Which is fine; not everyone has to brew. We have to turn those people away because otherwise we have to shut down to the public, and we are not using our kettle. It's almost like someone showing up at a bowling alley with 60 people and saying, "We want to hangout in the bowling alley and drink and eat but we don't want to bowl." It's not really an option, right? Bigger locations will enable us to have a bar area, a restaurant area where people can drink and dine, and also run a large corporate event without shutting down, or run a nice party that doesn't want to brew, but also at the same time have people come in and brew and even drink. That's why we are expanding, and we feel our margins and our sales will be that much higher.



                  What are the specifics of the expansion? What are you trying to do, and why are you raising money?
                  



We are raising $1.7 million to open a location in Boston. The spot is about 5600 sq ft., and it's what we need. The cost of the build out is going to be about $300 per sq ft.The landlord is giving us $100 per sq ft, which is just over half a million dollars. That means that our total build out cost is $1,060,000. The equipment costs, for things like signs and awnings and tables and chairs and POS systems and things like that, are approximately $100,000. We have a brewing package as part of the systems that we have to put in place and to install that is about $80,000. We need to get the kettles, which are $120,000. The boiler that heats the kettles to boil your beer is about $30,000. That total cost is approximately $300,000. So we are at 1.7 million. There will be miscellaneous costs as well. We need our beer and wine license in Massachusetts which is about $80,000, and professional fees, and things like that, which is going to come to about $160,000.




                  Why did you choose the Boston area?
                  



We chose Seaport, which is a new area in central Boston. It is the hippest, fastest growing place in the city. As a matter of fact, GE is opening up their world headquarters there as well. There are also a large amount of software companies there, making the district very innovative and there is development going on everywhere; condos and a nightclub, so we will be right in the middle of all of it. Also, there is a brewery there called Trillium, you may have heard of Harpoon; their brewery is not too far away as well. It's a great location to be in. In fact we have been looking for a location there for probably a good year or two and we are really excited about the location that we have now. The location carries our target demographic...young professionals. We are right next door the the financial district and of course a lot of offices. So, we've got our corporate business, it's going to be significant for corporate events right downtown. PWC just moved in and there are a lot of other cool, young, innovative businesses and it's a perfect demographic for us.



                  Who makes up your team, and how are you qualified to do this? Who do you surround yourself with and why does everyone want to grow Hopsters?
                  



The core team is my wife and I. I take the lead on the strategy and focus on how we drive revenue. My wife is takes the lead on marketing, social media and how to get people in there to spend money. I’m also pretty good at figuring out how to make it all cool, fun, as well as how to take our values and achieve our mission while making money. What I've learned from the last few years is really about how to fine tune the business. Karen focuses on the operations side. She manages the inbound relationships with people that want to come in on the corporate piece. For example, this year we are doing about $55,000 in corporate sales where last year we did like $15,000. Karen has really focused on managing the relationships and managing the contracts and the administrative aspects of the business on the corporate side. We have an amazing chef who's been with us for about 6 months now and we are really working on providing a beer-centric menu for people. Not only do we suggest pairings, but we are always looking at ways to add beer to the food. For example, this fall we are having a beer fondue, and a steak and ale pie. We have a very craft beer focused menu. He's been a chef for the last 10 years, went to culinary school, and he's owned his own restaurant. His role will be managing the restaurant here and staffing and managing the large restaurant in downtown Boston when we open in Seaport. In terms of managing our beverage program in the front of the house, that falls to our front of house and bar manager, John. He has a hospitality degree from BU. He's been in the beer trade business and the beverage business for many years. He will be running our beverage program down in Boston. He will also be managing front of house aspects of Seaport. We recently hired Cassidy as our Head Brewer.  He came to us as a brewer with Sam Adams.  He will be responsible for overall brewing operations in Newton and expanding into the SeaPort.Our brewer is [00:50:09 Tim]. He is responsible, with my direction, for implementing the beer that we brew. He also does recipe development. He came up through the ranks at Hopsters, starting off as a homebrewer like myself, then he was brewing with the customers and then doing competitive brewing. When we move to Seaport we have brewers, masterbrewers, waitstaff, and bar staff. The core team will move to Boston and they will pass between Newton and Boston. The strategic management and the weekly operations for Newton will also fall to the staff in Boston. We are not going to brew our own beer in Boston. We are going to do that here in Newton and double the capacity of the brewery there. Then we will send our beer down to the Boston location. We don't want to use our 5,000 sq ft to brew beer, we want to use it for the restaurant, the bar, and the customers. We will be looking for a general manager in Boston. We are looking for someone who has a restaurant background but who knows that we are not simply a restaurant. We want to provide more of a restaurant menu, however, which is why we want someone who has that experience who can help us grow from Hopsters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. As soon as we turn the leaf and close on the funding, we will be doing a fairly extensive search for a general manager.



                  How will you make money?
                  



Since Jan 2016 (and going forward when combined with Store #2--the prototype for growth) we have 5 revenue streams in various levels of maturity. Beer/Liquor Sales (Both house brewed and guest) accounts for approx. 31% of revenue. Food sales, approximately 30% of revenue. Beer brewing with corporate groups, public groups or small group kettle sales approx. 34%, off premise sales 2% and contract brewing aprox. 3%.



                  How do you acquire customers?
                  



We have a significant online social media presence that includes 15K Facebook followers, online advertising, outbound corporate sales executive, inbound sales executive and inbound media executive. Media Relations.



                  What's new about what you're making? How is it different?
                  



Nobody does what we do on the East Coast and we have virtually no competition nationally. We are unique in the fact that we have the brew your own experience with the emphasis on corporate events as well as an upscale brew pub restaurant/bar. Think "Foodertainment"--Dave & Busters, etc.



                  How big is the market?
                  



We believe there should be at least one or two Hopsters in every US urban area and potentially overseas. If you are over 21 and looking for a fun experience with friends, work or family then Hopsters is for you.



                  Who are your competitors? How are you different?
                  



No competition, you cannot brew beer, drink craft beer and eat anywhere on the east coast, however for corporate business people have other options such as Kings Bowling and F1 Formula Racing, however no brewing alternative.



                  What do you understand about your business that others don't get?
                  



Our model yields tremendous profitability. While we are a restaurant, the majority of our revenues come from higher margin business so we do not face the business financial challenges of a restaurant. We have much lower costs and much higher margins.



                  What's your biggest risk? What keeps you up at night?
                  



It's about execution every single day and as we grow, we will need to continue to bring in great colleagues. Getting the capital to open #2 which will be the prototype for growth. Licensing is always a challenge, as each jurisdiction has different rules and regulations.
