business, or affairs of, or any action taken or failure to act on
behalf of, the Company except to the extent that any of the

4.2 Indemnification
.

(a) General . The
Company shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is threatened to
be made a party to a proceeding (as defined
Section 4.2(e) ) by reason of the fact that he

manager, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, to the
fullest extent permitted under the TBOC. Such right shall be a
contract right and as such shall run to the benefit of the Member,

extent permitted under the TBOC. If a claim for indemnification or

entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. The
Member shall not be required to contribute capital in respect of
any indemnification claim under this Section 4.2
.

(c) Defenses to Claims
. It shall be a defense to any such action that such
indemnification or advancement of costs of defense is not permitted
under the TBOC, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Company. Neither the failure of the Company (including, its
independent legal counsel, the Member or the Manager) to have made
its determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the
claimant is permissible in the circumstances nor an actual
