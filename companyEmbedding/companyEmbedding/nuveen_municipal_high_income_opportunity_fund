Objective
The fund's primary investment objective is to provide high current income exempt from regular federal income tax. Its secondary investment objective is to seek attractive total return consistent with its primary objective.


Highlights
Seeks to provide:
Attractive monthly tax-free income
Portfolio diversification
Attractive after tax total returns




Investment Strategy
The fund invests in municipal securities that are exempt from federal income taxes.  The fund invests at least 50% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated, at the time of investment, investment grade (Baa/BBB or better by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch) or, if they are unrated, are judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. The fund may invest up to 50% of its managed assets in municipal securities that, at the time of investment, are rated below investment grade quality or that are unrated but judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. No more than 10% of the fund's managed assets may be invested in municipal securities rated at or below B3/B-, or that are unrated but judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. Up to 30% of the fund's managed assets may be invested in municipal securities that pay interest that is taxable under the federal alternative minimum tax applicable to individuals. The fund uses leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Low-Quality Bond Risk: The fund concentrates a large portion of its investments in low-quality bonds (sometimes called “junk bonds”), which have greater credit risk and generally are less liquid and have more volatile prices than higher quality securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. Its down 0.08, from 1 in 2016Q3. Then the "price" is smoothed using a mofidied Wilders' smoothing algorithm. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. The STC indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. The RSI was originally created by J.

					Nuveen Floating Rate Income Opportunity Fund is a diversified closed-end management investment company. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. At the time of writing, EOG Resources Inc (EOG) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 110.47. The 50 day moving average went down $-0.09 or -0.78% whereas the 200 day moving average was up $0.05 or +0.44%. In some cases, MA's may be used as strong reference points for spotting support and resistance levels. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. Wilder laid out the foundation for future technical analysts to further investigate the RSI and its relationship to underlying price movements. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Nuveen Texas Quality Municipal Income Fund (NTX) is 14.73. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend.Interested investors may be watching the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. As a general observance, the more overbought or oversold the reading displays, the more likely a reversal may take place. Nuveen California Municipal Value Fund has a 52-week low of $9.84 and a 52-week high of $11.50. A reading under 20 would suggest no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal.

SubTotal:1.04%0.74%

Interest Expense from Leverage0.18%0.17%

Total1.22%0.91%





							Fund fees and expenses are presented as a percentage of both common shareholder capital and total fund investment capital. Total investment capital includes common assets as well as assets attributable to the fund's issuance of senior securities (e.g. preferred shares and debt). The table's first column portrays the costs directly and indirectly borne by common shareholders on an investment in the fund's common shares. The table's second column portrays the costs borne by the fund on its total investment capital, which enables a common shareholder to better understand how fund expenses impact portfolio investment returns. Interest expenses from leverage are shown separately, because they represent costs associated with the fund's financing activities which are distinct from the costs associated with the fund's underlying core operations.
						

							Other Expenses and Total Expenses do not include interest expenses arising from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse floating rate securities (if any) held by the Fund. Interest expense arises because accounting rules require the fund to treat interest paid by trusts issuing certain inverse floating rate instruments held by the fund as having been paid (indirectly) by the fund. Because the fund also recognizes a corresponding amount of additional income earned (also indirectly), the fund's net asset value per share, net investment income and total return have not been affected by this accounting treatment. See the fund's Annual Report for information on the fund's inverse floating rate investments and recognized interest expense.
Expense ratios are calculated using the prior 12 months of expense data as of the previous month-end.








Fund shares are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Shares of closed-end funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



An investment in this fund presents a number of risks and is not suitable for all investors. Investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investing. For more detailed information on the specific risks associated with this fund, please view the Overview tab.




				NOTES


1 The ratio of total assets of the Fund, less all liabilities that are not outstanding borrowings or outstanding preferreds, at par, to the sum of the Fund’s outstanding borrowings and outstanding preferreds, at par.

^ The annualized ratio of the sum of leverage costs to the average leverage amount for a given time period.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.
