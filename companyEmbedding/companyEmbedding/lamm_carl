Biographical notes:

Carl Johan Lamm was born and educated in Sweden, and studied archaeology at the University of Stockholm. He wrote about the
                        glass excavated at Samarra in 1928, and became a leading scholar on Islamic arts and craft, notably in glass and carpets.
                        He was on the staff of the Stockholm Museum and taught at Uppsala University. He was active in the Norwegian resistance during
                        World War II. Lamm died in 1981.
