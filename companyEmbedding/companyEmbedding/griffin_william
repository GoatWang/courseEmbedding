 The Payson Petroleum Investor Center is a resource for investor who believe they may have lost money as a result of their investments in Payson oil and gas offerings. This website is not affiliated with Payson.
Payson’s principals, Matthew Griffin and William Griffin, have been accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged that Matthew and William Griffin misled investors about Payson’s promised participation in oil & gas programs and about the compensation Payson would receive from such programs, among others.
Peiffer Rosca Wolf law firm securities lawyers Alan Rosca and James Booker have been investigating the Payson offerings and are preparing to take action and seek compensation on behalf of Payson investors. Their goal is to try and supplement whatever recovery, if any, may be available through Payson’s bankruptcy and/or the SEC action. Their focus is on brokerage firms that promoted Payson investments and recommended such investments to their customers without first conducting adequate due diligence as to Payson.
The Peiffer Rosca Wolf lawyers have begun filing claims on behalf of Payson investors against brokerage firms that, their investigation suggests, failed to adequately research and vet Payson before recommending Payson investments to their customers.

The Peiffer Rosca Wolf securities practice lawyers Alan Rosca and James Booker are investigating the sales practices of certain broker-dealer firms that sold interests in Texas oil and gas partnerships offered by Payson Petroleum, Inc. (“Payson”), Matthew Griffin, and William Griffin. Specifically, the Peiffer Rosca Wolf lawyers are investigating the sales practices of certain brokerage firms that recommended and sold Payson to investors without conducting adequate due diligence as to Payson, the offerings, and its principals before making such recommendations.
The Peiffer Rosca Wolf securities lawyers have already filed claims on behalf of Payson investors, arising out of allegedly inadequate due diligence by such investors’ financial advisors, and are preparing additional claims.
“Brokerage firms have a duty to reasonably investigate new investment products they bring to their customers’ attention,” said Alan Rosca, a member of the Peiffer Rosca Wolf law firm who is overseeing the Payson investigation. “Members of the investing public have the right to expect that when their investment advisors make an investment recommendation, those advisors have first researched the product they are recommending. We’ll continue to hold liable, on behalf of investors, those brokerage firms that disregard their duties to adequately investigate the investment products they recommend to their customers,” said Rosca.
The Payson programs at issue include Payson Petroleum Brown No. 1, L.P.; Payson Petroleum J.C. #1, LP; Payson Petroleum Jenny #1 L.P.; Payson Developmental Drilling Fund 2014 II, LP; Payson Drilling Fund 2015 I, LP; Payson Drilling Fund 2015 II, LP; Payson Petroleum Grayson 2 Well LP; Payson Petroleum Crowe 1, LP; Payson Petroleum 3 Well LP; and Payson Petroleum 3 Well 2014, LP.
Payson Petroleum’s Principals, Matthew Griffin and William Griffin, Accused of Securities Fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission
Payson Petroleum principals Matthew Griffin and William Griffin were charged with securities fraud by the SEC in November 2016. The SEC alleged that the Griffins, through Payson, raised $23 million in a fraudulent offering in two Texas partnerships for the purpose of developing three oil and gas wells. According to the SEC, the Griffins misled investors about Payson’s compensation as the investment program’s sponsor and operator and Payson’s promised participation in the program.
The Griffins misrepresented that Payson’s consideration as program sponsor/operator/co-investor would be limited to 20% of any petroleum revenue generated by the wells, according to the SEC.  Instead, as alleged by the SEC, Payson appropriated the entirety of the offering proceeds net of offering costs. Additionally, the Griffins misrepresented to investors that Payson would contribute 20% ($5.4 million) of the offering amount and that the cash would be used to cover 20% of the cost of the well and cover any cost overages in drilling and completing the wells, according to the SEC. However, Payson contributed no money to the offering and lacked the financial means to pay any cost overage, according to the complaint filed by the SEC.

They already represent Payson investors.

 The Payson Petroleum Investor Center is a resource for investor who believe they may have lost money as a result of their investments in Payson oil and gas offerings. This website is not affiliated with Payson.
Payson’s principals, Matthew Griffin and William Griffin, have been accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged that Matthew and William Griffin misled investors about Payson’s promised participation in oil & gas programs and about the compensation Payson would receive from such programs, among others.
Peiffer Rosca Wolf law firm securities lawyers Alan Rosca and James Booker have been investigating the Payson offerings and are preparing to take action and seek compensation on behalf of Payson investors. Their goal is to try and supplement whatever recovery, if any, may be available through Payson’s bankruptcy and/or the SEC action. Their focus is on brokerage firms that promoted Payson investments and recommended such investments to their customers without first conducting adequate due diligence as to Payson.
The Peiffer Rosca Wolf lawyers have begun filing claims on behalf of Payson investors against brokerage firms that, their investigation suggests, failed to adequately research and vet Payson before recommending Payson investments to their customers.
Payson investors are encouraged to contact attorneys Alan Rosca or James Booker for more information or a free, no-obligation evaluation of their recovery options, at 888-998-0520, by email at arosca@prwlegal.com, or through the contact form on this website.

Overview
Edward Dorr Griffin remains one of the most significant revivalists of the early nineteenth century, and in this two-volume set, his most influential works are collected. There are fifty-nine sermons, including a memoir of Griffin’s life. Griffin’s writing and sermons are well-known for powerful exposition of Scripture and compassionate calls for revival. His writing is also characterized by solid theology and evangelical concerns. After studying theology from Jonathan Edwards, he entered the ministry. A firm believer in education, he later became president and professor of sacred rhetoric of Williams College.
This collection is invaluable to any student of revivalist influence and anyone wanting a greater understanding of living a holy life. With the Logos edition, The Life and Sermons of Edward D. Griffin (2 Vols.) is readily accessible with your other resources, perfect for personal or academic study.


Key Features

Over 1,200 pages of sermons
Contains memoir of Griffin’s life
Encouraging and astute exposition of Scripture
Includes detailed table of contents



From the Editor
The history of his [Griffin’s] life seems little less than the history of one unbroken revival; and it would perhaps be difficult to name the individual in our country since the days of [George] Whitefield, who has been instrumental of an equal number of hopeful conversions.
—William B. Sprague

About Death at Nuremberg
Assigned to the Nuremberg war trials, special agent James Cronley, Jr., finds himself fighting several wars at once, in the dramatic new Clandestine Operations novel about the birth of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Cold War. When Jim Cronley hears he’s just won the Legion of Merit, he figures there’s another shoe to drop, and it’s a big one: he’s out as Chief, DCI-Europe. His new assignments, however, couldn’t be bigger: to protect the U.S. chief prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials from a rumored Soviet NKGB kidnapping, and to hunt down and dismantle the infamous Odessa, an organization dedicated to helping Nazi war criminals escape to South America.It doesn’t take long for the first attempt on his life, and then the second. NKGB or Odessa? Who can tell? The deeper he pushes, the more secrets tumble out: a scheme to swap Nazi gold for currency, a religious cult organized around Himmler himself, an NKGB agent who is actually working for the Mossad, a German cousin who turns out to be more malevolent than he appears–and a distractingly attractive newspaperwoman who seems to be asking an awful lot of questions. Which one will turn out to be the most dangerous? Cronley wishes he knew.

Praise

Praise for the Clandestine Operations series“An incredible mix of intrigue and diplomacy from a literary team that ignites suspense loves everywhere. Readers will be panting for the next novel.” —Suspense Magazine“A Griffin adventure to bring out the Walter Mitty in every red-white-and-blue-blooded American male.” —Kirkus Reviews“Engaging…It’s a testament to the authors’ skill and wide experience that the pages seem to turn themselves.”–Publishers Weekly“An excellent series. The period between WWII and the Cold War offers raw material for several books, and as fans of Griffin’s body of work are well aware, he really sinks his teeth into politics and history.”–Booklist

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
