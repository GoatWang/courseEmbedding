 Methodology of ECI indices






					ECI refers to a range of European Convertible Indices.
					Convertible bonds are a separate asset class that cannot be compared directly to either stocks or bonds.The European convertibles market requires a specific range of indices because of its size and distinct nature.
					Our indices fulfil three requirements:
measure the daily performance of convertible markets;
show the structure of the European market and the euro zone using convertible bonds with satisfactory liquidity;
determine the market's overall behaviour and enable the standard analysis of convertible bonds - conversion premium, yield, stock sensitivity, fair value, etc.
					The goal of accurately representing the market determines the number of convertibles in indices. The number can vary depending on market conditions: about 80 in the ECI Europe, 65 in the ECI Europe ex USD and 50 in the ECI Euro.
					The Top ECI 25 index is made up of a fixed number of 25 convertibles. The constituents are made up of the 25 convertibles in the ECI Europe ex USD index that have most of the sensitivity to interest rates, stocks, credit risk and volatility.

The asset management arm of the Exane Group is embodied by its 2 asset management companies, Exane asset management and Ellipsis AM. Their expertise derives from the Group businesses, through two dynamic specialised asset management strategies, based respectively on the equity and fixed-income universes.

Founded in 2001, Exane asset management is a portfolio management company specialising in stock-picking within the European equity investment universe.
Since its creation, Exane asset management has focused on absolute performance, delivered by its experienced team of portfolio managers, analysts and sector experts. Exane asset management has thus become one of the leading French and European players in long/short equity fund management.
Assets under management at the end of May 2016 stood at EUR 6.6 billion, through 12 long/short equity funds and 1 equity fund.
OUR EQUITY EXPERTISE AT THE HEART OF OUR APPROACH
Our investment universe is made up of listed equities. Our development strategy draws from our founding principles: - Sectorial expertise, Exane asset management's core business- Concentrating risks on our recognized areas of expertise
Our organizational structure is based on distinct sector segmentation, which fosters high-quality expertise, within a secure risk control environment.
Drawing on its expertise in equities and the solidity of its team of fund managers-analysts, Exane asset management therefore offers 2 types of conviction-based asset management strategies, absolute performance (the company's core business line) and European equities since 2012, to a diversified portfolio of European clients, institutions and corporates, distribution, banking and insurance networks, multi-management.
www.exane-am.com

With a 12-year track record, Ellipsis AM is one of Exane Group's asset management units. It has expertise in active and specialised fund management, offering conviction funds on value added assets: convertible bonds, credit funds (high yield, short term and credit allocation) and exclusive funds (dividends, overlay, long/short credit).
ELLIPSIS AM: CONVERTIBLE, CREDIT AND DIVERSIFIED FUNDS
Ellipsis AM currently has EUR 1.8 bn in funds under management (at end June 2016) and 24 dedicated employees including 8 fund managers. Ellipsis AM is a major player in bond fund management and a reference in European convertible fund management. Ellipsis AM has research and risk management at the core of its investment process. Its historical culture combining convictions and risk management offers a strong fit with the Exane Group's knowhow.
Thanks to our "research-driven" approach, we take an absolutely independent position on our convictions. We capitalise on the unique access to Exane Group research on equities, convertibles and debt securities. Gildas Hita de Nercy has been Chairman of the Board of Ellipsis AM since 2012, after 20 years as Head of Exane Derivatives Research.
Our range of collective, dedicated funds satisfies the requirements of various investor profiles: Institutionals, UCITS, wealth management, multi-management, family offices and independent financial advisers. Our funds are marketed both directly and via Exane Derivatives, our main distributor. Our main funds are registered in France, Switzerland and Italy.

          Institutional Holdings Changes      




Background Information:


Exane Asset Management SA »
Exane AM is an active, conviction-based manager which incorporates fundamental analysis, market knowledge and risk management in their investment approach, aiming to capture alpha by tactically selecting assets based on qualitative, quantitative and chartist analysis.For long/short equity they cumulate buy positions with short sale positions in equities, resulting in low correlation to equity indexes. They select securities based on a fundamental approach combining stock-picking and macroeconomic analysis.Because the long/short equity strategy associates long positions with hedge positions, their strategy has a low level of correlation with stock market indexes and aims to generate performance through the arbitrage of relative valuation incoherence between different stocks or between industries, irrespective of equity market trends.

Exane Asset Management SA »
Exane AM is an active, conviction-based manager which incorporates fundamental analysis, market knowledge and risk management in their investment approach, aiming to capture alpha by tactically selecting assets based on qualitative, quantitative and chartist analysis.For long/short equity they cumulate buy positions with short sale positions in equities, resulting in low correlation to equity indexes. They select securities based on a fundamental approach combining stock-picking and macroeconomic analysis.Because the long/short equity strategy associates long positions with hedge positions, their strategy has a low level of correlation with stock market indexes and aims to generate performance through the arbitrage of relative valuation incoherence between different stocks or between industries, irrespective of equity market trends.
