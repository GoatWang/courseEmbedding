NEW YORK, May 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Royce & Associates, LP, the small-cap equity specialist, is announcing two notable changes as part of the ongoing long-term succession planning at the firm. 
Christopher D. Clark will become Chief Executive Officer of Royce & Associates, LP effective July 1, 2016, marking an important step in the planned evolution of the firm's executive management. 








Mr. Clark was named President on July 1, 2014 and has managed the firm alongside Charles M. Royce for the past two years. He remains the firm's President and, along with Francis D. Gannon, its Co-Chief Investment Officer. 
Mr. Royce, who has served as President or CEO since founding the firm in 1972, will remain as Chairman and Portfolio Manager.
Mr. Royce commented, "Chris has exhibited excellent leadership qualities since joining Royce in 2007, and has been pivotal in helping us make this management transition over the past few years.  I have complete confidence in his ability to continue running our firm and leading our talented team while preserving our special culture. I look forward to continuing to work with him on strategic issues while, perhaps most important, these moves allow me to focus my time on what I enjoy most, managing portfolios."
Messrs. Clark, Royce, and Gannon serve on the firm's Management Committee, along with General Counsel John E. Denneen, CFO Peter K. Hoglund, and Senior Advisor John D. Diederich.
Royce is also announcing the elevation of several portfolio managers on two of the firm's signature offerings—Royce Pennsylvania Mutual and Premier Funds—effective May 1, 2016. For Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund, Jay S. Kaplan and Lauren A. Romeo are now portfolio managers, after previously serving as assistant portfolio managers, while Mr. Royce is the lead portfolio manager. Similarly, Ms. Romeo and Steven G. McBoyle are now portfolio managers for Royce Premier Fund, where each was formerly an assistant portfolio manager, with Mr. Royce as lead portfolio manager.
Mr. Clark noted, "We are very fortunate to have such talented and experienced investment professionals working alongside Chuck on some of our firm's most important portfolios. Over time, Jay, Lauren, and Steve have each demonstrated great talent as portfolio managers. As they continue to work closely with Chuck on these funds, they'll provide our investors with experience and continuity for years to come."

 Educational Background



 


New York University

                  Founded in 1831, New York University is now one of the largest private universities in the United States. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the distinguished Association of American Universities.

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 40,000 students attending 18 schools and colleges at five major centers in Manhattan and in sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees.  Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.

The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also formally affiliated the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine,  in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.

And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi – the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university – and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.                





 Career History



Director of Quantitative Strategies

                                    1994 - Current                


Royce & Associates LP


                  Royce & Associates invests clients’ assets primarily in the equity securities of U.S. and foreign companies at across all market-caps using a value approach. A significant portion of clients’ assets are invested in the securities of micro-, small-, and mid-cap companies. Royce's value approach is based on their belief that the securities of certain micro-, small-, or mid-cap companies may sell at a discount from the firm's estimate of the companies' current worth. Royce attempts to identify and invest in these companies with the expectation that the value discount will narrow over time and thus provide capital appreciation for their clients. Investments may include purchases of securities offered in initial public offerings, secondary offerings, private placements, long and/or short positions in U.S. and non-U.S. publicly issued and non-public common stocks, ADRs, preferred stocks, stock warrants and rights, bonds of all types, including (without limitation) distressed and defaulted bonds, notes or other debentures, debt participations or bank debt, convertible securities, distressed securities, partnership interests, swaps, participation notes, derivative contracts and structured notes, and other securities or financial instruments. Royce may also invest a portion of the assets of certain accounts in ETFs, closed-end funds, money market funds and other funds.
