Tobin James


    Built from the ground up on the site of an old stagecoach stop, it might seem more natural to stroll into the old-western-style saloon, place your booted foot upon the brass rail of the bar, and order a shot of whiskey from the bartender. But in the Tobin James tasting room, award-winning wines are poured from behind the grand, antique 1860’s Brunswick mahogany bar from Blue Eye, Missouri.

Notes From the Winemaker:

Since 1985, Zinfandel has been our flagship varietal. The Ballistic Zinfandel represents a perfect example of what Paso Robles Zinfandel should taste like. We scour the Paso Robles appellation to find the finest vineyards, actually 27 in all, including many that are over 60 years old. Always included in this blend in great proportions is the Dusi Vineyard, a 75 year old, dry farmed, head trained gem that produces some of the finest Paso Robles has to offer.
From these 27 vineyards, we are able to craft the perfect Zin, with gobs of rich fruit and jam, and just the right amount of pepper and spice. One of our favorite food pairing wines, match this with just about everything!
Taste "Paso in a Glass".

About Tobin James Cellars
It all started with an extra six tons of grapes that a winery could not accept and process. Tobin (Toby) James, a lowly assistant winemaker at the time, asked the owner of the winery if he could have the grapes and make wine out of them for himself. The owner replied, "sure kid, knock yourself out". A year and a half later, gold medals began pouring in for Toby's first Zinfandel, the 1985 "Blue Moon" Zin.
After making his wines at another local winery for a few years, and tasting and selling them out of a local wine shop in town, Toby finally took the plunge and built Tobin James Cellars in 1993.
Built from the ground up on the site of an old stagecoach stop, it might seem more natural to stroll into the old-fashioned western-style saloon, place your booted foot on the brass rail of the bar and order a shot of whiskey from the bartender. However, in the Tobin James tasting room, award winning wines are poured from behind the grand, antique 1860's Brunswick mahogany bar from Blue Eye, Missouri.
Tobin James Cellars, located 8 miles east of Paso Robles on Highway 46, sits among 71 acres of vineyard's and oak dotted hills. A magnificent setting for magnificent wines! As soon as you approach, you see something unique. The wooden structures, heralded by the rotating blades of a towering water pump, have a character all their own, There is even a restored stage coach stop that is now being used as a guest house that will take your breath away. It seems everything structural is relevant of age and history.
Come visit Tobin James Cellars for a truly unique wine tasting experience, or call us for a delivery and find out for yourself why our wines are "Paso Robles in a glass"! You will see why this Paso Robles Winery is a favorite stop for locals and visitors alike.
 
The Winemakers  Tobin James and Lance Silver
Tobin (Toby) James grew up on a vineyard in Indiana, worked in a wine shop in Cincinnati and knew at the age of 18 that he would own a winery. He apprenticed at the Estrella River Winery, eventually being hired on full time and becoming their cellar master. From there, he headed to Eberle Winery to eventually make their wines with Gary Eberle.
When Peachy Canyon started, the owner needed a winemaker. A deal was struck so that Toby would become the founding winemaker and also have the opportunity to continue making Tobin James Cellars' wine at the same facility. The very first wine Toby made won a spot on the coveted "top 100" wines of the year with the Wine Spectator. Toby's reputation continued to grow, and in 1993 decided to build his own winery on highway 46 east of Paso Robles.
Lance and Claire Silver met Tobin James in 1996 on a quest to either buy an existing winery or start a new one. The trio quickly clicked, and knew that a partnership would answer their dreams. The three partners make a perfect match between winemaking and business expertise.
Lance, a self confessed "certified wine snob", brought his own touch to the Tobin James Cellars' winemaking style, adding even more intensity and depth to the incredible lineup of wines. With the Silvers' and Toby's commitment to excellence, Tobin James Cellars will continue to strive to make the greatest wines on Earth and to provide their renowned and outstanding hospitality.
Claire Silver, Lance's wife and Toby's "prettier" business partner, handles many of the business operations of the winery. Claire is also involved in making Tobin James wines, doing final sensory evalutions and wine blending. She really enjoys connecting with tasting room guests, offering them true Paso Robles hospitality while they experience and savor Tobin James' incredible line-up of wines.
Claire grew up in San Francisco and Los Angeles. She and Lance met while they were attending UNLV and married shortly before graduation. They moved to Whittier shortly after the birth of their twin daughters. In 1997, the Silvers moved to Paso Robles to pursue the winery business.
Monica Martin, General Manager- A native Paso Roblan, Monica started with Toby when the current facility opened in 1993, and has become the heart and soul of Tobin James Cellars. Handling everything from accounts payable to Zinfandel, Monica is indispensable to the day to day management of the winery.

“It Worked Out for Everybody”
Tobin James Cellars off hwy. 46 just east of Paso Robles, mid-way up the Golden State, has earned a reputation as one of the region’s most popular, fun wine destinations.  When Tobin opened his tasting room in 1994, Bruce and Pam Boring had also just recently started the California Wine Club.  “Back then nobody knew who Tobin James was or Paso Robles, and Bruce took a chance by featuring my wines,” says Tobin. “It worked out for everybody.”
It’s about to work out again with two fantastic Tobin James CWC selections …
There’s a Party In There!
Located at the site of an historic stagecoach stop, Tobin James Cellars offers down home ambiance, loud music and
louder crowds bellying up to the old 1860s mahogany bar (delivered all the way from Blue Eye, Missouri).  Before you swing open the door, you can hear a party going on. Why is wine so fun at Tobin James Cellars? Look no further than the founder himself!
“Our winery is all about people enjoying every day, and a glass of wine makes the day better,” says Tobin James. “If you come home and don’t have a glass of wine, that is a boring day.  I love that we make a product that people open with family and enjoy it with food and friends. That is an honor for us, and we never forget that.”
“When I play, we sell wine!”
Tobin’s first vintage was in 1987, and for several years he made his wines in other winery facilities.  When he opened his own winery and tasting room in 1994, things took off.  “I just wanted to wear rubber boots and get my hands red making wine.  But it suddenly turned into a business,” Tobin smiles.  “I couldn’t do it without my partners Lance and Claire Silver.  I would be nowhere without those guys. They are the best.   Lance makes everything run.  It leaves me to do what I do best, and that is play.  And when I play, we sell wine.”
The very friendly winery staff does its part too.  “It doesn’t cost anything to be friendly,” Tobin says.
Early Start In Wine
Tobin may have learned that kind of neighborliness growing up in Indiana (he was born in California). By the age of eight, he was working for his brothers in their vineyard and wine shop.  When he was 21, inspired by a visit from Paso Robles winemaker Gary Eberle, Tobin headed out to the region to work for him for nothing, ultimately joining Gary’s winery as assistant winemaker.
Eberle got more than he bargained for.  The young man ended up making a Zinfandel from surplus grapes that earned Double Gold Medals and launched Tobin on his winemaking career.
Meteor Sighting
Tobin James’ reputation rocketed skyward like a meteor.  He became founding winemaker for Peachy Canyon in Paso Robles in 1989, and his first wine, a Zinfandel, earned 69th place in Wine Spectator’s 1992 “Top 100 Wines of the World.”
Tobin left Peachy Canyon to begin his own winery, purchasing 41 acres and an old stagecoach stop on Hwy. 46 east.  He renovated the old house for guests, then built his rustic, Out West style winery.  The party began! “People might think this western stuff is gimmicky, but it’s not. This is the way our bars were in Paso — they were saloons. I tell people, we wanted to make a snobby winery, but we didn’t know how to do it!  We don’t have a violinist in the corner, we’ve got Merle Haggard on, that is the way it is. I’m just a country boy that makes pretty good wine.”
Hello Paso
When this country boy started selling wine elsewhere, he ran into a little problem.  “When I said I had a winery in Paso Robles, people in Los Angeles would say, ‘Oh, in Texas.’  Now everybody knows where Paso Robles is, and I love that.  I saw the whole transformation here, going from seven wineries to 250.”
Tobin’s tireless promotion of the region earned him “Wine Person of the Year 2010” from the Paso Robles Wine Alliance and other awards.  It has also made his winery a Paso Robles hot spot, where wine lovers from all over come to put their feet up on the bar’s brass rail and enjoy 20 or so different Tobin James wines.  “We have a problem at our winery,” Tobin confesses.  “If somebody comes up with a new grape, we want it, and then we go, oh my gosh, we made it, now we have to sell it.  That’s where our wine club comes in.”  Twenty-four thousand “James Gang” club members enjoy wines like Tempranillo and Refosco, because this country boy just can’t stop having fun. His son is right behind him, studying winemaking at Fresno State University, while his and his wife Ermie’s children man the pizza oven and serve the finger foods at the winery’s annual parties. Uncork your bottles of Tobin James wines and get ready for a party in the glass. Stop by the “saloon” next time you’re in Paso Robles at 8950 Union Road, Paso Robles, CA 93446, (805) 239-2204.  Here’s a toast, to Tobin James Cellars and fun with wine!
SELECTION SALUTE
2008 Titan Hills Vineyards “Fiasco”
• Tobin James Cellars does not submit its wines to competitions or for review.  Word-of-mouth is this winery’s calling card.   “’Fiasco’ is made from all our best wines, $20-$40 bottles,” says Tobin.  “We want this wine back!  It took off and everybody is going nuts for it.  It’s your good fortune to get it.”
• Bright garnet in color, this Mediterranean style blend serves up aromas of dark fruit and spice, followed by juicy red fruit flavors and a yummy finish.
• Fruit was sourced from 20 hillside vineyards in Paso Robles (18 on the cooler Westside).   Grapes were hand picked from September 21 to November 6, 2008.  Fruit was gently crushed, then fermented for seven to 16 days depending on the grape lot.
• This red aged for 14 months in small French and American oak barrels.  The final blend was Syrah (55%), Zinfandel (25%) and Barbera (20%).  “We produced this wine specifically as a drinkable and fun wine, and it sold so well, we may bring it back,” says Tobin.
•  This fabulous red blend is a star with Smoked Baby Back Ribs, Grilled Burgers, Portabello Mushrooms with Caramelized Onions or any spicy Italian dish.
• Enjoy now or hold up to five years.
•  Alcohol:                    14.9%
pH:                              3.53
Total Acidity:                    0.70g/100mL
Cases Produced:          6,000
Bottling Date:                   June 2010
Release Date:                    Summer 2010
2010 “Radiance” Chardonnay
• Like other Tobin James wines, Radiance sells out every year and is not submitted for awards or reviews.
• Gorgeous gold, this crisp white wows you with its fragrances of rich lemon, apple and tropical fruits. Pineapple, pear and banana flavors merge into a lingering finish.  Another glass, please!
• Lockwood Vineyard in Monterey County supplied all of the fruit for this 100% Chardonnay.
•  Grapes were harvested on October 13 -15, 2010. Harvest began at daybreak and was stopped when grape temperatures reached 68˚F.
• This wine’s crisp, tropical, well-balanced flavors were preserved by a cold, slow fermentation (45 days, 51˚F average) and the addition of 8% barrel-fermented Chardonnay.
• “This is my favorite wine!” says Tobin.  “I love its luscious, tropical fruity flavors.  You know, big guys are always coming here saying they just want to try the reds. I tell them, this my  and my Chardonnay, it doesn’t cost anything to taste.’  He tastes it, says he doesn’t like it, but then says, ‘give me three cases.’  Happens all the time with this wine.  If someone doesn’t like our Radiance Chardonnay, they need to see a psychologist!”
•  This Chardonnay is the perfect choice with seafood of all kinds, lightly sauced chicken and veal.
• Enjoy now or hold up to three years.
•  Alcohol:                    13.8%
pH:                              3.41
Total Acidity:                     0.66g/100mL
Cases Produced:          4,000
Bottling Date:                   May 2011
Release Date:                    June 2011

Tobin December 2008 Synopsis This is the third and much expanded edition of James Tobin's history of the first hundred years of investigations at Meteor Crater. Included in the volume are narrative tours of the sites on the crater rim and slopes, as well as a narrative hike of all the historic locations on the floor of the crater. The second half of the book is devoted to historical paper by several of the earliest investigators.
