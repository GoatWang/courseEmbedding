KonaRed® Hawaiian Coffee

                  KonaRed® is uniquely sourced from Hawaii Coffee, where it has developed for over 175 years. Kona’s coffee growing region is only about fifty square miles in all, and is farmed largely by small landowners. In order for coffee plants to thrive, the region in which they grow must meet six climate elements: rich soil, proper elevation, sunshine, cloud cover, rain and a moderate slope for proper drainage of roots. Like much of Hawaii, Kona offers all six of these ideal climate conditions for growing coffee, allowing for the creation of award-winning coffees and the antioxidant powers of KonaRed®' Hawaiian Coffeeberry® coffee fruit.

But there is something different about the Kona coffee cherries produced, earning this coffee a worldwide reputation for excellence. The difference could lie in the care with which Kona coffee is hand picked, ensuring that only the highest quality coffee cherries are harvested for coffee and coffee fruit production.

                            The long-running patent infringement lawsuit between Sandwich Isles Trading Company, maker of KonaRed coffee fruit beverages, and VDF FutureCeuticals appears to be nearing an end.

A scam underdog? Products in stores, just a front? Stock between 5 and 6 cents for the last year? A scam is when they pump up a company before any revenue and develop a large market cap. Kona has been making product. You can't have good numbers when you're investing in product. And you can't have higher share prices when you don't have product. Sure, the products have to sell, but they now have the products. There's always that 17 percent partnership with coca cola they mentioned a while back. Shelf space is the key here I think. They have the products now.

KonaRed® - A Hawaiian Coffee Company from KonaRed on Vimeo.




KonaRed® Hawaiian Coffee

                  KonaRed® is uniquely sourced from Hawaii Coffee, where it has developed for over 175 years. Kona’s coffee growing region is only about fifty square miles in all, and is farmed largely by small landowners. In order for coffee plants to thrive, the region in which they grow must meet six climate elements: rich soil, proper elevation, sunshine, cloud cover, rain and a moderate slope for proper drainage of roots. Like much of Hawaii, Kona offers all six of these ideal climate conditions for growing coffee, allowing for the creation of award-winning coffees and the antioxidant powers of KonaRed®' Hawaiian Coffeeberry® coffee fruit.

But there is something different about the Kona coffee cherries produced, earning this coffee a worldwide reputation for excellence. The difference could lie in the care with which Kona coffee is hand picked, ensuring that only the highest quality coffee cherries are harvested for coffee and coffee fruit production.
