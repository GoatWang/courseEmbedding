Robert Veillette 
WATERBURY – Robert E. Veillette, 96, passed away peacefully on May 15, 2017, after a brief illness, surrounded by his loving family.
Bob was born in Waterbury on Nov. 19, 1920, to Emile and Marie (Gelinas) Veillette and was educated in local schools. He was proud to have served his country during World War II as a member of the United States Air Force 58th Fighter Group, serving in the South Pacific.
Beginning at age 9, he began a lifelong passion for investments and the stock market. He opened the first Waterbury office of Shearson Hammill & Co. where he was the manager for many years through various mergers. He retired in 1996 as a senior vice president for Solomon Smith Barney. He was active in many community affairs.
He was married to his high school sweetheart, Katie, and together they raised five children by whom he is survived: Betty Veillette of Southbury, Jan Veillette-Carey (Michael) of Middlebury, Robin Donato (Daniel) of Waterbury, Douglas Veillette (Mary) of Middlebury and Robert S. Veillette (Maria) of Middlebury. He is also survived by 13 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
Besides his parents, he was predeceased by his wife of 47 years, Catherine Moss; his wife of 25 years, Joan Beech Sheehy; his grandson, Christopher Donato; and his brother, Philip. He is also survived by his nieces, Jean Dillon (Pat), Susan Safino (Guy), Megan Platt and several great- and great-great nieces and nephews.
A funeral Mass will be celebrated on Thursday, May 18, at 10 a.m. at St. Margaret Church, 289 Willow St. Friends are asked to meet directly at church. Burial will follow in New St. Joseph Cemetery with military honors. There are no calling hours. The Murphy Funeral Home, 115 Willow St., is in charge of arrangements. 
In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be sent to the Veillette Family Fund, which benefits Silas Bronson Library, c/o Connecticut Community Foundation, 43 Field St., Waterbury, CT 06702.
