Forum Funds II - Baywood Socially Responsible Fund is an open ended equity mutual fund launched by Forum Funds II. The fund is managed by SKBA Capital Management, LLC. It invests in the public equity markets of the United States. The fund invests in stocks of socially responsible companies operating across diversified sectors. It invests in value stocks of mid cap companies having market capitalization between $1 billion and $5 billion. The fund employs a combination of fundamental and quantitative analysis with a focus on factors such as social criteria such as an issuer’s community relations, corporate governance, diversity, employee relations, environmental impact and sustainability, human rights record, and product safety, a price significantly below the intrinsic value of the issuer, below average price to sales and price to cash flow ratios, and sound overall financial condition of the issuer to create its portfolio. It benchmarks the performance of its portfolio against the MSCI KLD 400 Social Index and the Russell 1000 Value Index. The Fund does not invest in an issuer that derives more than 5% of its total revenue from tobacco, alcohol, gambling, abortion or weaponry (whether sold to consumers or the military), or that is involved in nuclear power. It was formerly known as City National Rochdale Funds - City National Rochdale Socially Responsible Equity Fund. Forum Funds II - Baywood Socially Responsible Fund was formed on January 3, 2005 and is domiciled at the United States.

Both  one-day events, one on June 21 in New York and the other on September 26 in San Francisco, are designed for investment decision-makers at pension funds, endowments, foundations, and selected family offices, RIA firms, and investment consultants who are looking for possible answers to those questions.

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

2. The Initial Advisor, a Delaware
limited liability company, is a registered
investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the
‘‘Advisers Act’’). The Initial Advisor, or
an entity controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with the Initial
Advisor, serves, or will serve, as the
investment adviser to each of the
Funds.2 The Advisor may enter into
sub-advisory agreements with one or
more additional investment advisers to
act as ‘‘Sub-Advisers’’ with respect to
particular Funds (each, a ‘‘SubAdviser’’). The Distributor is a Broker
(as defined below) and serves as the
existing Fund’s principal underwriter
and distributor.
3. Applicants request relief to the
extent necessary to permit: (a) Each
Fund (each, a ‘‘Fund of Funds,’’ and
collectively, the ‘‘Funds of Funds’’) to
acquire shares of registered open-end
management investment companies
(each an ‘‘Unaffiliated Open-End
Investment Company’’), registered
closed-end management investment
companies, business development
companies (each registered closed-end
management investment company and
each business development company,
an ‘‘Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment
Company’’ and, together with the
Unaffiliated Open-End Investment
Companies, the ‘‘Unaffiliated
Investment Companies’’), and registered
unit investment trusts (‘‘UITs’’) (the
‘‘Unaffiliated Trusts,’’ collectively with
the Unaffiliated Investment Companies,
the ‘‘Unaffiliated Funds’’), in each case,
that are not part of the same ‘‘group of
investment companies’’ as the Funds of
Funds; 3 (b) the Unaffiliated Funds, their
principal underwriters and any broker
or dealer registered under the Securities
in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the 1940 Act, as The
BDC Income Fund and are, or may in the future be,
advised by the Initial Advisor or any other
investment adviser controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with the Initial Advisor
(together with The BDC Income Fund, each series
a ‘‘Fund,’’ and collectively, ‘‘Funds’’). All entities
that currently intend to rely on the requested order
are named as applicants. Any other entity that relies
on the order in the future will comply with the
terms and conditions of the application.
2 All references to the term ‘‘Full Circle Advisors,
LLC’’ include any successors in interest to Full
Circle Advisors, LLC. A successor is limited to an
entity that results from a reorganization into
another jurisdiction or a change in the type of
business organization. The term ‘‘Advisor’’ includes
(i) the Initial Advisor and (ii) any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with the
Initial Advisor that serves as investment adviser to
the Funds.
3 For purposes of the request for relief, the term
‘‘group of investment companies’’ means any two
or more registered investment companies, including
closed-end investment companies and BDCs, that
hold themselves out to investors as related
companies for purposes of investment and investor
services.

Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘‘1934 Act’’)
(‘‘Broker’’) to sell shares of such
Unaffiliated Funds to the Funds of
Funds; (c) the Funds of Funds to acquire
shares of other registered investment
companies, including open-end
management investment companies and
series thereof, closed-end management
investment companies and UITs, as well
as business development companies (if
any), in the same group of investment
companies as the Funds of Funds
(collectively, the ‘‘Affiliated Funds,’’
and, together with the Unaffiliated
Funds, the ‘‘Underlying Funds’’); 4 and
(d) the Affiliated Funds, their principal
underwriters and any Broker to sell
shares of the Affiliated Funds to the
Funds of Funds.5 Applicants also
request an order under sections 6(c) and
17(b) of the 1940 Act to exempt
applicants from section 17(a) to the
extent necessary to permit Underlying
Funds organized as open-end
investment companies (‘‘Underlying
Open-End Investment Companies’’) and
UITs (‘‘Underlying UITs’’) to sell their
shares to Funds of Funds and redeem
their shares from Funds of Funds.
4. Applicants also request an
exemption under section 6(c) from rule
12d1–2 under the 1940 Act to permit
any existing or future Fund of Funds
that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the
1940 Act (‘‘Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund of
Funds’’) and that otherwise complies
with rule 12d1–2 under the 1940 Act, to
also invest, to the extent consistent with
its investment objective(s), policies,
strategies and limitations, in other
4 Certain of the Underlying Funds may be
registered under the 1940 Act as either UITs or
open-end management investment companies and
have obtained exemptions from the Commission
necessary to permit their shares to be listed and
traded on a national securities exchange at
negotiated prices and, accordingly, to operate as
exchange-traded funds (collectively, ‘‘ETFs’’ and
each, an ‘‘ETF’’). In addition, certain of the
Underlying Funds may in the future pursue their
investment objectives through a master-feeder
arrangement in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(E) of the
1940 Act. In accordance with condition 12, a Fund
of Funds may not invest in an Underlying Fund that
operates as a feeder fund unless the feeder fund is
part of the same ‘‘group of investment companies’’
as its corresponding master fund or the Fund of
Funds. If a Fund of Funds invests in an Affiliated
Fund that operates as a feeder fund and the
corresponding master fund is not within the same
‘‘group of investment companies’’ as the Fund of
Funds and Affiliated Fund, the master fund would
be an Unaffiliated Fund for purposes of the
application and its conditions.
5 Applicants state that they do not believe that
investments in business development companies
present any particular considerations or concerns
that may be different from those presented by
investments in registered closed-end investment
companies. In addition, Applicants represent that
the Funds of Funds will not invest in reliance on
the order in BDCs or closed-end investment
companies that are not listed and traded on a
national securities exchange.

Applicants’ Legal Analysis
A. Section 12(d)(1)
1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act,
in relevant part, prohibits a registered
investment company from acquiring
shares of an investment company if the
securities represent more than 3% of the
total outstanding voting stock of the
acquired company, more than 5% of the
total assets of the acquiring company,
or, together with the securities of any
other investment companies, more than
10% of the total assets of the acquiring
company. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the
1940 Act prohibits a registered openend investment company, its principal
underwriter, and any Broker from
selling the investment company’s shares
to another investment company if the
sale will cause the acquiring company
to own more than 3% of the acquired
company’s voting stock, or if the sale
will cause more than 10% of the
acquired company’s voting stock to be
owned by investment companies
generally. Section 12(d)(1)(C) prohibits
an investment company from acquiring
any security issued by a registered
closed-end investment company if such
acquisition would result in the
acquiring company, any other
investment companies having the same
investment adviser, and companies
controlled by such investment
companies, collectively, owning more
than 10% of the outstanding voting
stock of the registered closed-end
investment company.
2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the 1940 Act
provides that the Commission may
exempt any person, security, or
transaction, or any class or classes of
persons, securities or transactions, from
any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
Applicants request an exemption under
section 12(d)(1)(J) of the 1940 Act from
the limitations of sections 12(d)(1)(A),
(B) and (C) to the extent necessary to
permit: (i) The Funds of Funds to
acquire shares of Underlying Funds in
excess of the limits set forth in section
12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act; and
(ii) the Underlying Funds, their
principal underwriters and any Broker
to sell shares of the Underlying Funds
to the Funds of Funds in excess of the
limits set forth in section 12(d)(1)(B) of
the 1940 Act.
3. Applicants state that the proposed
arrangement will not give rise to the
policy concerns underlying sections

12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C), which include
concerns about undue influence by a
fund of funds over underlying funds,
excessive layering of fees, and overly
complex fund structures. Accordingly,
applicants believe that the requested
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
4. Applicants submit that the
proposed structure will not result in the
exercise of undue influence by a Fund
of Funds or its affiliated persons over
the Underlying Funds. Applicants assert
that the concern about undue influence
does not arise in connection with a
Fund of Funds’ investment in the
Affiliated Funds because they are part of
the same group of investment
companies. To limit the control a Fund
of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate 6
may have over an Unaffiliated Fund,
applicants propose a condition
prohibiting the Advisor and any person
controlling, controlled by or under
common control with the Advisor, and
any investment company and any issuer
that would be an investment company
but for section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7)
of the 1940 Act advised or sponsored by
the Advisor or any person controlling,
controlled by or under common control
with the Advisor (collectively, the
‘‘Group’’) from controlling (individually
or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund
within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of
the 1940 Act. The same prohibition
would apply to any Sub-Adviser and
any person controlling, controlled by or
under common control with the SubAdviser, and any investment company
or issuer that would be an investment
company but for section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act (or portion of
such investment company or issuer)
advised or sponsored by the SubAdviser or any person controlling,
controlled by or under common control
with the Sub-Adviser (collectively, the
‘‘Sub-Adviser Group’’).
5. With respect to closed-end
Underlying Funds, applicants note that
although closed-end funds may not be
unduly influenced by a holder’s right of
redemption, closed-end Underlying
Funds may be unduly influenced by a
holder’s ability to vote a large block of
stock. To address this concern,
applicants submit that, with respect to
a Fund’s investment in an Unaffiliated
Closed-End Investment Company, (i)
6 A ‘‘Fund of Funds Affiliate’’ is the Advisor, any
Sub-Adviser, promoter or principal underwriter of
a Fund of Funds, as well as any person controlling,
controlled by or under common control with any
of those entities. An ‘‘Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate’’
is an investment adviser(s), sponsor, promoter or
principal underwriter of any Unaffiliated Fund or
any person controlling, controlled by or under
common control with any of those entities.

each member of the Group or SubAdviser Group that is an investment
company or an issuer that would be an
investment company but for section
3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act will
vote its shares of the Unaffiliated
Closed-End Investment Company in the
manner prescribed by section
12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act and (ii) each
other member of the Group or SubAdviser Group will vote its shares of the
Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment
Company in the same proportion as the
vote of all other holders of the same
type of such Unaffiliated Closed-End
Investment Company’s shares.
Applicants state that, in this way, an
Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment
Company will be protected from undue
influence by a Fund of Funds through
the voting of the Unaffiliated ClosedEnd Investment Company’s shares.
6. Applicants propose other
conditions to limit the potential for
undue influence over the Unaffiliated
Funds, including that no Fund of Funds
or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the
extent it is acting in its capacity as an
investment adviser to an Unaffiliated
Investment Company or sponsor to an
Unaffiliated Trust) will cause an
Unaffiliated Fund to purchase a security
in an offering of securities during the
existence of any underwriting or selling
syndicate of which a principal
underwriter is an Underwriting Affiliate
(‘‘Affiliated Underwriting’’).7
7. To further ensure that an
Unaffiliated Investment Company
understands the implications of a Fund
of Funds’ investment under the
requested exemptive relief, prior to its
investment in the shares of an
Unaffiliated Investment Company in
excess of the limit of section
12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, a Fund of
Funds and the Unaffiliated Investment
Company will execute an agreement
stating, without limitation, that each of
their boards of directors or trustees (for
any entity, the ‘‘Board’’) and their
investment advisers understand the
terms and conditions of the order and
agree to fulfill their responsibilities
under the order (the ‘‘Participation
Agreement’’). Applicants note that an
Unaffiliated Investment Company
(including an ETF or an Unaffiliated
Closed-End Investment Company)
7 An ‘‘Underwriting Affiliate’’ is a principal
underwriter in any underwriting or selling
syndicate that is an officer, director, trustee,
advisory board member, investment adviser, subadviser or employee of the Fund of Funds, or a
person of which any such officer, director, trustee,
investment adviser, sub-adviser, member of an
advisory board or employee is an affiliated person.
An Underwriting Affiliate does not include any
person whose relationship to an Unaffiliated Fund
is covered by section 10(f) of the 1940 Act.

would also retain its right to reject any
initial investment by a Fund of Funds
in excess of the limits in section
12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act by
declining to execute the Participation
Agreement with the Fund of Funds. In
addition, an Unaffiliated Investment
Company (other than an ETF or closedend fund whose shares are purchased by
a Fund of Funds in the secondary
market) will retain its right at all times
to reject any investment by a Fund of
Funds. Finally, subject solely to the
giving of notice to a Fund of Funds and
the passage of a reasonable notice
period, an Unaffiliated Fund (including
an ETF or an Unaffiliated Closed-End
Investment Company) could terminate a
Participation Agreement with the Fund
of Funds.
8. Applicants state that they do not
believe that the proposed arrangement
will result in excessive layering of fees.
The Board of each Fund of Funds,
including a majority of the trustees who
are not ‘‘interested persons’’ within the
meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 1940
Act (the ‘‘Independent Trustees’’), will
find that the management or advisory
fees charged under a Fund of Funds’
advisory contract are based on services
provided that are in addition to, rather
than duplicative of, services provided
under the advisory contract(s) of any
Underlying Fund in which the Fund of
Funds may invest. In addition, the
Advisor will waive fees otherwise
payable to it by a Fund of Funds in an
amount at least equal to any
compensation (including fees received
pursuant to any plan adopted by an
Unaffiliated Investment Company under
rule 12b–1 under the 1940 Act) received
from an Unaffiliated Fund by the
Advisor, or an affiliated person of the
Advisor, other than any advisory fees
paid to the Advisor or an affiliated
person of the Advisor by the
Unaffiliated Investment Company, in
connection with the investment by the
Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund.
9. Applicants further state that any
sales charges and/or service fees
charged with respect to shares of a Fund
of Funds will not exceed the limits
applicable to funds of funds set forth in
in rule 2830 of the Conduct Rules of the
NASD (‘‘NASD Conduct Rule 2830’’).8
10. Applicants submit that the
proposed arrangement will not create an
overly complex fund structure.
Applicants note that no Underlying
Fund will acquire securities of any other
investment company or company
relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of
8 Any references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830
include any successor or replacement FINRA rule
to NASD Conduct Rule 2830.

B. Section 17(a)
1. Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act
generally prohibits sales or purchases of
securities between a registered
investment company and any affiliated
person of the company. Section 2(a)(3)
of the 1940 Act defines an ‘‘affiliated
person’’ of another person to include (a)
any person directly or indirectly
owning, controlling, or holding with
power to vote, 5% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of the
other person; (b) any person 5% or more
of whose outstanding voting securities
are directly or indirectly owned,
controlled, or held with power to vote
by the other person; and (c) any person
directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the other person.
2. Applicants state that the Funds of
Funds and the Affiliated Funds may be
deemed to be under the common control
of the Advisor and, therefore, affiliated
persons of one another. Applicants also
state that the Funds of Funds and the
Underlying Funds may also be deemed
to be affiliated persons of one another if
a Fund of Funds owns 5% or more of
the outstanding voting securities of one
or more of such Underlying Funds.
Applicants state that the sale of shares
by the Underlying Open-End Investment
Companies or Underlying UITs to the
Funds of Funds and the purchase of
those shares from the Funds of Funds by
the Underlying Open-End Investment
Companies or Underlying UITs (through
redemptions) could be deemed to
violate section 17(a).9
3. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act
authorizes the Commission to grant an
order permitting a transaction otherwise
prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds
that (i) the terms of the proposed
transaction are fair and reasonable and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned; (ii) the
proposed transaction is consistent with
the policies of each registered
investment company concerned; and
(iii) the proposed transaction is
consistent with the general purposes of
the 1940 Act. Section 6(c) of the 1940
9 Applicants acknowledge that receipt of any
compensation by (a) an affiliated person of a Fund
of Funds, or an affiliated person of such person, for
the purchase by the Fund of Funds of shares of an
Underlying Fund or (b) an affiliated person of an
Underlying Fund, or an affiliated person of such
person, for the sale by the Underlying Fund of its
shares to a Fund of Funds may be prohibited by
section 17(e) (1) of the 1940 Act. The Participation
Agreement also will include this acknowledgement.

Act permits the Commission to exempt
any person or transactions from any
provision of the 1940 Act if such
exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the
purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.
4. Applicants submit that the
proposed transactions satisfy the
standards for relief under sections 17(b)
and 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants
state that the terms of the transactions
are reasonable and fair and do not
involve overreaching. Applicants state
that the terms upon which an
Underlying Fund will sell its shares to
or purchase its shares from a Fund of
Funds will be in accordance with the
rules and regulations under the 1940
Act.10 Applicants also state that the
proposed transactions will be consistent
with the policies of each Fund of Funds
and any Underlying Fund, and with the
general purposes of the 1940 Act.
C. Other Investments by Section
12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds
1. Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act
provides that section 12(d)(1) will not
apply to securities of an acquired
company purchased by an acquiring
company if: (i) The acquiring company
and acquired company are part of the
same ‘‘group of investment companies,’’
as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of
the 1940 Act; (ii) the acquiring company
holds only securities of acquired
companies that are part of the same
‘‘group of investment companies,’’ as
defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the
1940 Act, government securities, and
short-term paper; (iii) the aggregate sales
loads and distribution-related fees of the
acquiring company and the acquired
company are not excessive under rules
adopted pursuant to section 22(b) or
section 22(c) of the 1940 Act by a
securities association registered under
section 15A of the 1934 Act or by the
Commission; and (iv) the acquired
10 Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally
would purchase and sell shares of an Underlying
Fund that operates as an ETF or a closed-end fund
through secondary market transactions rather than
through principal transactions with the Underlying
Fund. Applicants nevertheless request relief from
sections 17(a)(1) and (2) to permit each Fund of
Funds that is an affiliated person, or an affiliated
person of an affiliated person, as defined in section
2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act, of an ETF or a closed-end
fund to purchase or redeem shares from the ETF or
closed-end fund. Applicants are not seeking relief
from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will
not apply to, transactions where an ETF or a closedend fund could be deemed an affiliated person, or
an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of a
Fund of Funds because an investment adviser to the
ETF or an entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with the investment adviser to the
ETF or closed-end fund is also an investment
adviser to the Fund of Funds.

company has a policy that prohibits it
from acquiring securities of registered
open-end management investment
companies or registered UITs in reliance
on section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the 1940
Act.
2. Rule 12d1–2 under the 1940 Act
permits a registered open-end
investment company or a registered UIT
that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the
1940 Act to acquire, in addition to
securities issued by another registered
investment company in the same group
of investment companies, government
securities, and short-term paper: (1)
Securities issued by an investment
company that is not in the same group
of investment companies, when the
acquisition is in reliance on section
12(d)(1)(A) or 12(d)(1)(F) of the 1940
Act; (2) securities (other than securities
issued by an investment company); and
(3) securities issued by a money market
fund, when the investment is in reliance
on rule 12d1–1 under the 1940 Act. For
the purposes of rule 12d1–2,
‘‘securities’’ means any security as
defined in section 2(a)(36) of the 1940
Act.
3. Applicants state that the proposed
arrangement would comply with rule
12d1–2 under the 1940 Act, but for the
fact that the Section 12(d)(1)(G) Funds
of Funds may invest a portion of their
assets in Other Investments. Applicants
request an order under section 6(c) of
the 1940 Act for an exemption from rule
12d1–2(a) to allow the Section
12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds to invest in
Other Investments. Applicants assert
that permitting a Section 12(d)(1)(G)
Fund of Funds to invest in Other
Investments as described in the
application would not raise any of the
concerns that section 12(d)(1) of the
1940 Act was intended to address.
4. Consistent with its fiduciary
obligations under the 1940 Act, a
Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds’
Board will review the advisory fees
charged by the Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund
of Funds’ investment adviser(s) to
ensure that the fees are based on
services provided that are in addition to,
rather than duplicative of, services
provided pursuant to the advisory
agreement of any investment company
in which the Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund
of Funds may invest.
Applicants’ Conditions
Investments by Funds of Funds in
Underlying Funds
Applicants agree that the order
granting the requested relief to permit
Funds of Funds to invest in Underlying
Funds shall be subject to the following

1. The members of the Group will not
control (individually or in the aggregate)
an Unaffiliated Fund within the
meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the 1940
Act. The members of a Sub-Adviser
Group will not control (individually or
in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund
within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of
the 1940 Act. With respect to a Fund’s
investment in an Unaffiliated ClosedEnd Investment Company, (i) each
member of the Group or Sub-Adviser
Group that is an investment company or
an issuer that would be an investment
company but for section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act will vote its
shares of the Unaffiliated Closed-End
Investment Company in the manner
prescribed by section 12(d)(1)(E) of the
1940 Act and (ii) each other member of
the Group or Sub-Adviser Group will
vote its shares of the Unaffiliated
Closed-End Investment Company in the
same proportion as the vote of all other
holders of the same type of such
Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment
Company’s shares. If, as a result of a
decrease in the outstanding voting
securities of any other Unaffiliated
Fund, the Group or a Sub-Adviser
Group, each in the aggregate, becomes a
holder of more than 25 percent of the
outstanding voting securities of such
Unaffiliated Fund, then the Group or the
Sub-Adviser Group will vote its shares
of the Unaffiliated Fund in the same
proportion as the vote of all other
holders of the Unaffiliated Fund’s
shares. This condition will not apply to
a Sub-Adviser Group with respect to an
Unaffiliated Fund for which the SubAdviser or a person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Sub-Adviser acts as the
investment adviser within the meaning
of section 2(a)(20)(A) of the 1940 Act (in
the case of an Unaffiliated Investment
Company) or as the sponsor (in the case
of an Unaffiliated Trust).
2. No Fund of Funds or Fund of
Funds Affiliate will cause any existing
or potential investment by the Fund of
Funds in an Unaffiliated Fund to
influence the terms of any services or
transactions between the Fund of Funds
or a Fund of Funds Affiliate and the
Unaffiliated Fund or an Unaffiliated
Fund Affiliate.
3. The Board of each Fund of Funds,
including a majority of the Independent
Trustees, will adopt procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that the
Advisor and any Sub-Adviser to the
Fund of Funds is conducting the
investment program of the Fund of
Funds without taking into account any
consideration received by the Fund of
Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate from
an Unaffiliated Fund or an Unaffiliated

services or transactions.
4. Once an investment by a Fund of
Funds in the securities of an
Unaffiliated Investment Company
exceeds the limit of section
12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, the Board
of the Unaffiliated Investment
Company, including a majority of the
Independent Trustees, will determine
that any consideration paid by the
Unaffiliated Investment Company to a
Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds
Affiliate in connection with any services
or transactions: (a) Is fair and reasonable
in relation to the nature and quality of
the services and benefits received by the
Unaffiliated Investment Company; (b) is
within the range of consideration that
the Unaffiliated Investment Company
would be required to pay to another
unaffiliated entity in connection with
the same services or transactions; and
(c) does not involve overreaching on the
part of any person concerned. This
condition does not apply with respect to
any services or transactions between an
Unaffiliated Investment Company and
its investment adviser(s), or any person
controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with such investment
adviser(s).
5. No Fund of Funds or Fund of
Funds Affiliate (except to the extent it
is acting in its capacity as an investment
adviser to an Unaffiliated Investment
Company or sponsor to an Unaffiliated
Trust) will cause an Unaffiliated Fund
to purchase a security in any Affiliated
Underwriting.
6. The Board of an Unaffiliated
Investment Company, including a
majority of the Independent Trustees,
will adopt procedures reasonably
designed to monitor any purchases of
securities by the Unaffiliated Investment
Company in an Affiliated Underwriting
once an investment by a Fund of Funds
in the securities of the Unaffiliated
Investment Company exceeds the limit
of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act,
including any purchases made directly
from an Underwriting Affiliate. The
Board of the Unaffiliated Investment
Company will review these purchases
periodically, but no less frequently than
annually, to determine whether the
purchases were influenced by the
investment by the Fund of Funds in the
Unaffiliated Investment Company. The
Board of the Unaffiliated Investment
Company will consider, among other
things: (a) Whether the purchases were
consistent with the investment
objectives and policies of the
Unaffiliated Investment Company; (b)
how the performance of securities
purchased in an Affiliated Underwriting
compares to the performance of

comparable securities purchased during
a comparable period of time in
underwritings other than Affiliated
Underwritings or to a benchmark such
as a comparable market index; and (c)
whether the amount of securities
purchased by the Unaffiliated
Investment Company in Affiliated
Underwritings and the amount
purchased directly from an
Underwriting Affiliate have changed
significantly from prior years. The
Board of the Unaffiliated Investment
Company will take any appropriate
actions based on its review, including,
if appropriate, the institution of
procedures designed to ensure that
purchases of securities in Affiliated
Underwritings are in the best interest of
shareholders.
7. Each Unaffiliated Investment
Company will maintain and preserve
permanently, in an easily accessible
place, a written copy of the procedures
described in the preceding condition,
and any modifications to such
procedures, and will maintain and
preserve for a period of not less than six
years from the end of the fiscal year in
which any purchase in an Affiliated
Underwriting occurred, the first two
years in an easily accessible place, a
written record of each purchase of
securities in an Affiliated Underwriting
once an investment by a Fund of Funds
in the securities of an Unaffiliated
Investment Company exceeds the limit
of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act,
setting forth (1) the party from whom
the securities were acquired, (2) the
identity of the underwriting syndicate’s
members, (3) the terms of the purchase,
and (4) the information or materials
upon which the determinations of the
Board of the Unaffiliated Investment
Company were made.
8. Prior to its investment in shares of
an Unaffiliated Investment Company in
excess of the limit set forth in section
12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, the Fund
of Funds and the Unaffiliated
Investment Company will execute a
Participation Agreement stating,
without limitation, that their Boards and
their investment advisers understand
the terms and conditions of the order
and agree to fulfill their responsibilities
under the order. At the time of its
investment in shares of an Unaffiliated
Investment Company in excess of the
limit set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i),
a Fund of Funds will notify the
Unaffiliated Investment Company of the
investment. At such time, the Fund of
Funds will also transmit to the
Unaffiliated Investment Company a list
of the names of each Fund of Funds
Affiliate and Underwriting Affiliate. The

practicable after a change occurs. The
Unaffiliated Investment Company and
the Fund of Funds will maintain and
preserve a copy of the order, the
Participation Agreement, and the list
with any updated information for the
duration of the investment and for a
period of not less than six years
thereafter, the first two years in an
easily accessible place.
9. Before approving any advisory
contract under section 15 of the 1940
Act, the Board of each Fund of Funds,
including a majority of the Independent
Trustees, shall find that the advisory
fees charged under the advisory contract
are based on services provided that are
in addition to, rather than duplicative
of, services provided under the advisory
contract(s) of any Underlying Fund in
which the Fund of Funds may invest.
Such finding, and the basis upon which
the finding was made, will be recorded
fully in the minute books of the
appropriate Fund of Funds.
10. The Advisor will waive fees
otherwise payable to it by a Fund of
Funds in an amount at least equal to any
compensation (including fees received
pursuant to any plan adopted by an
Unaffiliated Investment Company
pursuant to rule 12b–1 under the 1940
Act) received from an Unaffiliated Fund
by the Advisor, or an affiliated person
of the Advisor, other than any advisory
fees paid to the Advisor or its affiliated
person by the Unaffiliated Investment
Company, in connection with the
investment by the Fund of Funds in the
Unaffiliated Fund. Any Sub-Adviser
will waive fees otherwise payable to the
Sub-Adviser, directly or indirectly, by
the Fund of Funds in an amount at least
equal to any compensation received by
the Sub-Adviser, or an affiliated person
of the Sub-Adviser, from an Unaffiliated
Fund, other than any advisory fees paid
to the Sub-Adviser or its affiliated
person by the Unaffiliated Investment
Company in connection with the
investment by the Fund of Funds in the
Unaffiliated Fund made at the direction
of the Sub-Adviser. In the event that the
Sub-Adviser waives fees, the benefit of
the waiver will be passed through to the

Applicants' Representations

    1. The Trust is an open-end management company registered under the 
1940 Act and organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust may 
offer multiple series.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Applicants request that the order apply not only to the 
series of the Trust advised by the Initial Adviser, The BDC Income 
Fund, but also to any future series of the Trust and any other 
existing or future registered open-end management investment 
companies and any series thereof that are part of the same ``group 
of investment companies'', as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of 
the 1940 Act, as The BDC Income Fund and are, or may in the future 
be, advised by the Initial Advisor or any other investment adviser 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Initial 
Advisor (together with The BDC Income Fund, each series a ``Fund,'' 
and collectively, ``Funds''). All entities that currently intend to 
rely on the requested order are named as applicants. Any other 
entity that relies on the order in the future will comply with the 
terms and conditions of the application.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 1523]]

    2. The Initial Advisor, a Delaware limited liability company, is a 
registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 
(the ``Advisers Act''). The Initial Advisor, or an entity controlling, 
controlled by, or under common control with the Initial Advisor, 
serves, or will serve, as the investment adviser to each of the 
Funds.\2\ The Advisor may enter into sub-advisory agreements with one 
or more additional investment advisers to act as ``Sub-Advisers'' with 
respect to particular Funds (each, a ``Sub-Adviser''). The Distributor 
is a Broker (as defined below) and serves as the existing Fund's 
principal underwriter and distributor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ All references to the term ``Full Circle Advisors, LLC'' 
include any successors in interest to Full Circle Advisors, LLC. A 
successor is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization 
into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business 
organization. The term ``Advisor'' includes (i) the Initial Advisor 
and (ii) any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with the Initial Advisor that serves as investment adviser 
to the Funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Applicants request relief to the extent necessary to permit: (a) 
Each Fund (each, a ``Fund of Funds,'' and collectively, the ``Funds of 
Funds'') to acquire shares of registered open-end management investment 
companies (each an ``Unaffiliated Open-End Investment Company''), 
registered closed-end management investment companies, business 
development companies (each registered closed-end management investment 
company and each business development company, an ``Unaffiliated 
Closed-End Investment Company'' and, together with the Unaffiliated 
Open-End Investment Companies, the ``Unaffiliated Investment 
Companies''), and registered unit investment trusts (``UITs'') (the 
``Unaffiliated Trusts,'' collectively with the Unaffiliated Investment 
Companies, the ``Unaffiliated Funds''), in each case, that are not part 
of the same ``group of investment companies'' as the Funds of Funds; 
\3\ (b) the Unaffiliated Funds, their principal underwriters and any 
broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ``1934 Act'') (``Broker'') to sell shares of such Unaffiliated 
Funds to the Funds of Funds; (c) the Funds of Funds to acquire shares 
of other registered investment companies, including open-end management 
investment companies and series thereof, closed-end management 
investment companies and UITs, as well as business development 
companies (if any), in the same group of investment companies as the 
Funds of Funds (collectively, the ``Affiliated Funds,'' and, together 
with the Unaffiliated Funds, the ``Underlying Funds''); \4\ and (d) the 
Affiliated Funds, their principal underwriters and any Broker to sell 
shares of the Affiliated Funds to the Funds of Funds.\5\ Applicants 
also request an order under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the 1940 Act to 
exempt applicants from section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit 
Underlying Funds organized as open-end investment companies 
(``Underlying Open-End Investment Companies'') and UITs (``Underlying 
UITs'') to sell their shares to Funds of Funds and redeem their shares 
from Funds of Funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ For purposes of the request for relief, the term ``group of 
investment companies'' means any two or more registered investment 
companies, including closed-end investment companies and BDCs, that 
hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes 
of investment and investor services.
    \4\ Certain of the Underlying Funds may be registered under the 
1940 Act as either UITs or open-end management investment companies 
and have obtained exemptions from the Commission necessary to permit 
their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities 
exchange at negotiated prices and, accordingly, to operate as 
exchange-traded funds (collectively, ``ETFs'' and each, an ``ETF''). 
In addition, certain of the Underlying Funds may in the future 
pursue their investment objectives through a master-feeder 
arrangement in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act. In 
accordance with condition 12, a Fund of Funds may not invest in an 
Underlying Fund that operates as a feeder fund unless the feeder 
fund is part of the same ``group of investment companies'' as its 
corresponding master fund or the Fund of Funds. If a Fund of Funds 
invests in an Affiliated Fund that operates as a feeder fund and the 
corresponding master fund is not within the same ``group of 
investment companies'' as the Fund of Funds and Affiliated Fund, the 
master fund would be an Unaffiliated Fund for purposes of the 
application and its conditions.
    \5\ Applicants state that they do not believe that investments 
in business development companies present any particular 
considerations or concerns that may be different from those 
presented by investments in registered closed-end investment 
companies. In addition, Applicants represent that the Funds of Funds 
will not invest in reliance on the order in BDCs or closed-end 
investment companies that are not listed and traded on a national 
securities exchange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from 
rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act to permit any existing or future Fund of 
Funds that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act (``Section 
12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds'') and that otherwise complies with rule 
12d1-2 under the 1940 Act, to also invest, to the extent consistent 
with its investment objective(s), policies, strategies and limitations, 
in other financial instruments that may not be securities within the 
meaning of section 2(a)(36) of the 1940 Act (``Other Investments'').

Applicants' Legal Analysis

A. Section 12(d)(1)

    1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits 
a registered investment company from acquiring shares of an investment 
company if the securities represent more than 3% of the total 
outstanding voting stock of the acquired company, more than 5% of the 
total assets of the acquiring company, or, together with the securities 
of any other investment companies, more than 10% of the total assets of 
the acquiring company. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act prohibits a 
registered open-end investment company, its principal underwriter, and 
any Broker from selling the investment company's shares to another 
investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own 
more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale 
will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be 
owned by investment companies generally. Section 12(d)(1)(C) prohibits 
an investment company from acquiring any security issued by a 
registered closed-end investment company if such acquisition would 
result in the acquiring company, any other investment companies having 
the same investment adviser, and companies controlled by such 
investment companies, collectively, owning more than 10% of the 
outstanding voting stock of the registered closed-end investment 
company.
    2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission 
may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or 
classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of 
section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public 
interest and the protection of investors. Applicants request an 
exemption under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the 1940 Act from the 
limitations of sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B) and (C) to the extent 
necessary to permit: (i) The Funds of Funds to acquire shares of 
Underlying Funds in excess of the limits set forth in section 
12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act; and (ii) the Underlying Funds, 
their principal underwriters and any Broker to sell shares of the 
Underlying Funds to the Funds of Funds in excess of the limits set 
forth in section 12(d)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act.
    3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not give 
rise to the policy concerns underlying sections

[[Page 1524]]

12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C), which include concerns about undue influence 
by a fund of funds over underlying funds, excessive layering of fees, 
and overly complex fund structures. Accordingly, applicants believe 
that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and 
the protection of investors.
    4. Applicants submit that the proposed structure will not result in 
the exercise of undue influence by a Fund of Funds or its affiliated 
persons over the Underlying Funds. Applicants assert that the concern 
about undue influence does not arise in connection with a Fund of 
Funds' investment in the Affiliated Funds because they are part of the 
same group of investment companies. To limit the control a Fund of 
Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate \6\ may have over an Unaffiliated 
Fund, applicants propose a condition prohibiting the Advisor and any 
person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the 
Advisor, and any investment company and any issuer that would be an 
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the 
1940 Act advised or sponsored by the Advisor or any person controlling, 
controlled by or under common control with the Advisor (collectively, 
the ``Group'') from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) an 
Unaffiliated Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 
Act. The same prohibition would apply to any Sub-Adviser and any person 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Sub-
Adviser, and any investment company or issuer that would be an 
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act 
(or portion of such investment company or issuer) advised or sponsored 
by the Sub-Adviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under 
common control with the Sub-Adviser (collectively, the ``Sub-Adviser 
Group'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ A ``Fund of Funds Affiliate'' is the Advisor, any Sub-
Adviser, promoter or principal underwriter of a Fund of Funds, as 
well as any person controlling, controlled by or under common 
control with any of those entities. An ``Unaffiliated Fund 
Affiliate'' is an investment adviser(s), sponsor, promoter or 
principal underwriter of any Unaffiliated Fund or any person 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of those 
entities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. With respect to closed-end Underlying Funds, applicants note 
that although closed-end funds may not be unduly influenced by a 
holder's right of redemption, closed-end Underlying Funds may be unduly 
influenced by a holder's ability to vote a large block of stock. To 
address this concern, applicants submit that, with respect to a Fund's 
investment in an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company, (i) each 
member of the Group or Sub-Adviser Group that is an investment company 
or an issuer that would be an investment company but for section 
3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act will vote its shares of the 
Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company in the manner prescribed by 
section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act and (ii) each other member of the 
Group or Sub-Adviser Group will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated 
Closed-End Investment Company in the same proportion as the vote of all 
other holders of the same type of such Unaffiliated Closed-End 
Investment Company's shares. Applicants state that, in this way, an 
Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company will be protected from undue 
influence by a Fund of Funds through the voting of the Unaffiliated 
Closed-End Investment Company's shares.
    6. Applicants propose other conditions to limit the potential for 
undue influence over the Unaffiliated Funds, including that no Fund of 
Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the extent it is acting in 
its capacity as an investment adviser to an Unaffiliated Investment 
Company or sponsor to an Unaffiliated Trust) will cause an Unaffiliated 
Fund to purchase a security in an offering of securities during the 
existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal 
underwriter is an Underwriting Affiliate (``Affiliated 
Underwriting'').\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ An ``Underwriting Affiliate'' is a principal underwriter in 
any underwriting or selling syndicate that is an officer, director, 
trustee, advisory board member, investment adviser, sub-adviser or 
employee of the Fund of Funds, or a person of which any such 
officer, director, trustee, investment adviser, sub-adviser, member 
of an advisory board or employee is an affiliated person. An 
Underwriting Affiliate does not include any person whose 
relationship to an Unaffiliated Fund is covered by section 10(f) of 
the 1940 Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. To further ensure that an Unaffiliated Investment Company 
understands the implications of a Fund of Funds' investment under the 
requested exemptive relief, prior to its investment in the shares of an 
Unaffiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit of section 
12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, a Fund of Funds and the Unaffiliated 
Investment Company will execute an agreement stating, without 
limitation, that each of their boards of directors or trustees (for any 
entity, the ``Board'') and their investment advisers understand the 
terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their 
responsibilities under the order (the ``Participation Agreement''). 
Applicants note that an Unaffiliated Investment Company (including an 
ETF or an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company) would also retain 
its right to reject any initial investment by a Fund of Funds in excess 
of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act by declining to 
execute the Participation Agreement with the Fund of Funds. In 
addition, an Unaffiliated Investment Company (other than an ETF or 
closed-end fund whose shares are purchased by a Fund of Funds in the 
secondary market) will retain its right at all times to reject any 
investment by a Fund of Funds. Finally, subject solely to the giving of 
notice to a Fund of Funds and the passage of a reasonable notice 
period, an Unaffiliated Fund (including an ETF or an Unaffiliated 
Closed-End Investment Company) could terminate a Participation 
Agreement with the Fund of Funds.
    8. Applicants state that they do not believe that the proposed 
arrangement will result in excessive layering of fees. The Board of 
each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the trustees who are not 
``interested persons'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 
1940 Act (the ``Independent Trustees''), will find that the management 
or advisory fees charged under a Fund of Funds' advisory contract are 
based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than 
duplicative of, services provided under the advisory contract(s) of any 
Underlying Fund in which the Fund of Funds may invest. In addition, the 
Advisor will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund of Funds in 
an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received 
pursuant to any plan adopted by an Unaffiliated Investment Company 
under rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act) received from an Unaffiliated Fund 
by the Advisor, or an affiliated person of the Advisor, other than any 
advisory fees paid to the Advisor or an affiliated person of the 
Advisor by the Unaffiliated Investment Company, in connection with the 
investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund.
    9. Applicants further state that any sales charges and/or service 
fees charged with respect to shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed 
the limits applicable to funds of funds set forth in in rule 2830 of 
the Conduct Rules of the NASD (``NASD Conduct Rule 2830'').\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Any references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 include any 
successor or replacement FINRA rule to NASD Conduct Rule 2830.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create 
an overly complex fund structure. Applicants note that no Underlying 
Fund will acquire securities of any other investment company or company 
relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of

[[Page 1525]]

the 1940 Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) 
of the 1940 Act, except in certain circumstances identified in 
condition 12 below.

B. Section 17(a)

    1. Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits sales or 
purchases of securities between a registered investment company and any 
affiliated person of the company. Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act 
defines an ``affiliated person'' of another person to include (a) any 
person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with 
power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the 
other person; (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting 
securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with 
power to vote by the other person; and (c) any person directly or 
indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the 
other person.
    2. Applicants state that the Funds of Funds and the Affiliated 
Funds may be deemed to be under the common control of the Advisor and, 
therefore, affiliated persons of one another. Applicants also state 
that the Funds of Funds and the Underlying Funds may also be deemed to 
be affiliated persons of one another if a Fund of Funds owns 5% or more 
of the outstanding voting securities of one or more of such Underlying 
Funds. Applicants state that the sale of shares by the Underlying Open-
End Investment Companies or Underlying UITs to the Funds of Funds and 
the purchase of those shares from the Funds of Funds by the Underlying 
Open-End Investment Companies or Underlying UITs (through redemptions) 
could be deemed to violate section 17(a).\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Applicants acknowledge that receipt of any compensation by 
(a) an affiliated person of a Fund of Funds, or an affiliated person 
of such person, for the purchase by the Fund of Funds of shares of 
an Underlying Fund or (b) an affiliated person of an Underlying 
Fund, or an affiliated person of such person, for the sale by the 
Underlying Fund of its shares to a Fund of Funds may be prohibited 
by section 17(e) (1) of the 1940 Act. The Participation Agreement 
also will include this acknowledgement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to grant 
an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) 
if it finds that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and 
reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person 
concerned; (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the 
policies of each registered investment company concerned; and (iii) the 
proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 
1940 Act. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act permits the Commission to exempt 
any person or transactions from any provision of the 1940 Act if such 
exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly 
intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
    4. Applicants submit that the proposed transactions satisfy the 
standards for relief under sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the 1940 Act. 
Applicants state that the terms of the transactions are reasonable and 
fair and do not involve overreaching. Applicants state that the terms 
upon which an Underlying Fund will sell its shares to or purchase its 
shares from a Fund of Funds will be in accordance with the rules and 
regulations under the 1940 Act.\10\ Applicants also state that the 
proposed transactions will be consistent with the policies of each Fund 
of Funds and any Underlying Fund, and with the general purposes of the 
1940 Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally would 
purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that operates as an 
ETF or a closed-end fund through secondary market transactions 
rather than through principal transactions with the Underlying Fund. 
Applicants nevertheless request relief from sections 17(a)(1) and 
(2) to permit each Fund of Funds that is an affiliated person, or an 
affiliated person of an affiliated person, as defined in section 
2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act, of an ETF or a closed-end fund to purchase 
or redeem shares from the ETF or closed-end fund. Applicants are not 
seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will 
not apply to, transactions where an ETF or a closed-end fund could 
be deemed an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an 
affiliated person, of a Fund of Funds because an investment adviser 
to the ETF or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common 
control with the investment adviser to the ETF or closed-end fund is 
also an investment adviser to the Fund of Funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Other Investments by Section 12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds

    1. Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act provides that section 
12(d)(1) will not apply to securities of an acquired company purchased 
by an acquiring company if: (i) The acquiring company and acquired 
company are part of the same ``group of investment companies,'' as 
defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the 1940 Act; (ii) the acquiring 
company holds only securities of acquired companies that are part of 
the same ``group of investment companies,'' as defined in section 
12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the 1940 Act, government securities, and short-term 
paper; (iii) the aggregate sales loads and distribution-related fees of 
the acquiring company and the acquired company are not excessive under 
rules adopted pursuant to section 22(b) or section 22(c) of the 1940 
Act by a securities association registered under section 15A of the 
1934 Act or by the Commission; and (iv) the acquired company has a 
policy that prohibits it from acquiring securities of registered open-
end management investment companies or registered UITs in reliance on 
section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) of the 1940 Act.
    2. Rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act permits a registered open-end 
investment company or a registered UIT that relies on section 
12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act to acquire, in addition to securities 
issued by another registered investment company in the same group of 
investment companies, government securities, and short-term paper: (1) 
Securities issued by an investment company that is not in the same 
group of investment companies, when the acquisition is in reliance on 
section 12(d)(1)(A) or 12(d)(1)(F) of the 1940 Act; (2) securities 
(other than securities issued by an investment company); and (3) 
securities issued by a money market fund, when the investment is in 
reliance on rule 12d1-1 under the 1940 Act. For the purposes of rule 
12d1-2, ``securities'' means any security as defined in section 
2(a)(36) of the 1940 Act.
    3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement would comply with 
rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act, but for the fact that the Section 
12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds may invest a portion of their assets in 
Other Investments. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of 
the 1940 Act for an exemption from rule 12d1-2(a) to allow the Section 
12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds to invest in Other Investments. Applicants 
assert that permitting a Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds to invest in 
Other Investments as described in the application would not raise any 
of the concerns that section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act was intended to 
address.
    4. Consistent with its fiduciary obligations under the 1940 Act, a 
Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds' Board will review the advisory fees 
charged by the Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds' investment adviser(s) 
to ensure that the fees are based on services provided that are in 
addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided pursuant to 
the advisory agreement of any investment company in which the Section 
12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds may invest.

Applicants' Conditions

Investments by Funds of Funds in Underlying Funds

    Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief to 
permit Funds of Funds to invest in Underlying Funds shall be subject to 
the following conditions:

[[Page 1526]]

    1. The members of the Group will not control (individually or in 
the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund within the meaning of section 
2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act. The members of a Sub-Adviser Group will not 
control (individually or in the aggregate) an Unaffiliated Fund within 
the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act. With respect to a 
Fund's investment in an Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company, (i) 
each member of the Group or Sub-Adviser Group that is an investment 
company or an issuer that would be an investment company but for 
section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act will vote its shares of the 
Unaffiliated Closed-End Investment Company in the manner prescribed by 
section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act and (ii) each other member of the 
Group or Sub-Adviser Group will vote its shares of the Unaffiliated 
Closed-End Investment Company in the same proportion as the vote of all 
other holders of the same type of such Unaffiliated Closed-End 
Investment Company's shares. If, as a result of a decrease in the 
outstanding voting securities of any other Unaffiliated Fund, the Group 
or a Sub-Adviser Group, each in the aggregate, becomes a holder of more 
than 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such 
Unaffiliated Fund, then the Group or the Sub-Adviser Group will vote 
its shares of the Unaffiliated Fund in the same proportion as the vote 
of all other holders of the Unaffiliated Fund's shares. This condition 
will not apply to a Sub-Adviser Group with respect to an Unaffiliated 
Fund for which the Sub-Adviser or a person controlling, controlled by, 
or under common control with the Sub-Adviser acts as the investment 
adviser within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(A) of the 1940 Act (in 
the case of an Unaffiliated Investment Company) or as the sponsor (in 
the case of an Unaffiliated Trust).
    2. No Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate will cause any 
existing or potential investment by the Fund of Funds in an 
Unaffiliated Fund to influence the terms of any services or 
transactions between the Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate and 
the Unaffiliated Fund or an Unaffiliated Fund Affiliate.
    3. The Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the 
Independent Trustees, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to 
ensure that the Advisor and any Sub-Adviser to the Fund of Funds is 
conducting the investment program of the Fund of Funds without taking 
into account any consideration received by the Fund of Funds or Fund of 
Funds Affiliate from an Unaffiliated Fund or an Unaffiliated Fund 
Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions.
    4. Once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of an 
Unaffiliated Investment Company exceeds the limit of section 
12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, the Board of the Unaffiliated 
Investment Company, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, 
will determine that any consideration paid by the Unaffiliated 
Investment Company to a Fund of Funds or a Fund of Funds Affiliate in 
connection with any services or transactions: (a) Is fair and 
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services and 
benefits received by the Unaffiliated Investment Company; (b) is within 
the range of consideration that the Unaffiliated Investment Company 
would be required to pay to another unaffiliated entity in connection 
with the same services or transactions; and (c) does not involve 
overreaching on the part of any person concerned. This condition does 
not apply with respect to any services or transactions between an 
Unaffiliated Investment Company and its investment adviser(s), or any 
person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such 
investment adviser(s).
    5. No Fund of Funds or Fund of Funds Affiliate (except to the 
extent it is acting in its capacity as an investment adviser to an 
Unaffiliated Investment Company or sponsor to an Unaffiliated Trust) 
will cause an Unaffiliated Fund to purchase a security in any 
Affiliated Underwriting.
    6. The Board of an Unaffiliated Investment Company, including a 
majority of the Independent Trustees, will adopt procedures reasonably 
designed to monitor any purchases of securities by the Unaffiliated 
Investment Company in an Affiliated Underwriting once an investment by 
a Fund of Funds in the securities of the Unaffiliated Investment 
Company exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, 
including any purchases made directly from an Underwriting Affiliate. 
The Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company will review these 
purchases periodically, but no less frequently than annually, to 
determine whether the purchases were influenced by the investment by 
the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Investment Company. The Board of 
the Unaffiliated Investment Company will consider, among other things: 
(a) Whether the purchases were consistent with the investment 
objectives and policies of the Unaffiliated Investment Company; (b) how 
the performance of securities purchased in an Affiliated Underwriting 
compares to the performance of comparable securities purchased during a 
comparable period of time in underwritings other than Affiliated 
Underwritings or to a benchmark such as a comparable market index; and 
(c) whether the amount of securities purchased by the Unaffiliated 
Investment Company in Affiliated Underwritings and the amount purchased 
directly from an Underwriting Affiliate have changed significantly from 
prior years. The Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company will take 
any appropriate actions based on its review, including, if appropriate, 
the institution of procedures designed to ensure that purchases of 
securities in Affiliated Underwritings are in the best interest of 
shareholders.
    7. Each Unaffiliated Investment Company will maintain and preserve 
permanently, in an easily accessible place, a written copy of the 
procedures described in the preceding condition, and any modifications 
to such procedures, and will maintain and preserve for a period of not 
less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any 
purchase in an Affiliated Underwriting occurred, the first two years in 
an easily accessible place, a written record of each purchase of 
securities in an Affiliated Underwriting once an investment by a Fund 
of Funds in the securities of an Unaffiliated Investment Company 
exceeds the limit of section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the 1940 Act, setting 
forth (1) the party from whom the securities were acquired, (2) the 
identity of the underwriting syndicate's members, (3) the terms of the 
purchase, and (4) the information or materials upon which the 
determinations of the Board of the Unaffiliated Investment Company were 
made.
    8. Prior to its investment in shares of an Unaffiliated Investment 
Company in excess of the limit set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of 
the 1940 Act, the Fund of Funds and the Unaffiliated Investment Company 
will execute a Participation Agreement stating, without limitation, 
that their Boards and their investment advisers understand the terms 
and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities 
under the order. At the time of its investment in shares of an 
Unaffiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit set forth in 
section 12(d)(1)(A)(i), a Fund of Funds will notify the Unaffiliated 
Investment Company of the investment. At such time, the Fund of Funds 
will also transmit to the Unaffiliated Investment Company a list of the 
names of each Fund of Funds Affiliate and Underwriting Affiliate. The 
Fund of Funds will notify the

[[Page 1527]]

Unaffiliated Investment Company of any changes to the list as soon as 
reasonably practicable after a change occurs. The Unaffiliated 
Investment Company and the Fund of Funds will maintain and preserve a 
copy of the order, the Participation Agreement, and the list with any 
updated information for the duration of the investment and for a period 
of not less than six years thereafter, the first two years in an easily 
accessible place.
    9. Before approving any advisory contract under section 15 of the 
1940 Act, the Board of each Fund of Funds, including a majority of the 
Independent Trustees, shall find that the advisory fees charged under 
the advisory contract are based on services provided that are in 
addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided under the 
advisory contract(s) of any Underlying Fund in which the Fund of Funds 
may invest. Such finding, and the basis upon which the finding was 
made, will be recorded fully in the minute books of the appropriate 
Fund of Funds.
    10. The Advisor will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund 
of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including 
fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by an Unaffiliated 
Investment Company pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act) received 
from an Unaffiliated Fund by the Advisor, or an affiliated person of 
the Advisor, other than any advisory fees paid to the Advisor or its 
affiliated person by the Unaffiliated Investment Company, in connection 
with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund. Any 
Sub-Adviser will waive fees otherwise payable to the Sub-Adviser, 
directly or indirectly, by the Fund of Funds in an amount at least 
equal to any compensation received by the Sub-Adviser, or an affiliated 
person of the Sub-Adviser, from an Unaffiliated Fund, other than any 
advisory fees paid to the Sub-Adviser or its affiliated person by the 
Unaffiliated Investment Company in connection with the investment by 
the Fund of Funds in the Unaffiliated Fund made at the direction of the 
Sub-Adviser. In the event that the Sub-Adviser waives fees, the benefit 
of the waiver will be passed through to the Fund of Funds.
    11. Any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to 
shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to 
funds of funds set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830.
    12. No Underlying Fund will acquire securities of any other 
investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of 
the 1940 Act, in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) 
of the 1940 Act, except to the extent that such Underlying Fund: (a) 
Acquires such securities in compliance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 
1940 Act and is either an Affiliated Fund or is in the same ``group of 
investment companies'' as its corresponding master fund; (b) receives 
securities of another investment company as a dividend or as a result 
of a plan of reorganization of a company (other than a plan devised for 
the purpose of evading section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act); or (c) 
acquires (or is deemed to have acquired) securities of another 
investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the Commission 
permitting such Underlying Fund to: (i) Acquire securities of one or 
more investment companies for short-term cash management purposes or 
(ii) engage in inter-fund borrowing and lending transactions.

Other Investments by Section 12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds

    In addition, Applicants agree that the order granting the requested 
relief to permit Section 12(d)(1)(G) Funds of Funds to invest in Other 
Investments shall be subject to the following condition:
    13. Applicants will comply with all provisions of rule 12d1-2 under 
the 1940 Act, except for paragraph (a)(2) to the extent that it 
restricts any Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund of Funds from investing in Other 
Investments as described in the application.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
pursuant to delegated authority.
Kevin M. O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

What do Mifid II product governance rules really mean for managers? 
By
	
Chris Martin

Product governance is a key priority for the FCA. Its importance is set to rocket as the regulator concludes its Thematic Review into investment funds meeting the needs of investors and the Mifid II implementation deadline approaches. This is an area where further clarification is needed. As the industry awaits further guidance on best practice, there are a number of key considerations for asset management firms to adhere to when carrying out an effective product governance review, to ensure that products are operated in line with investors’ expectations.
Mifid II, with its remit to strengthen investor protection, requires product manufacturers to have effective oversight throughout the product lifecycle. These requirements compel product providers to understand and disclose its target markets and then conduct post-sale analysis. This is done to ensure that products are only being sold to those investors they were intended for.
The requirements may expand upon and be more explicit than the FCA’s existing guidance within the Responsibilities for Providers and Distributors for the Fair Treatment of Customers and what has been published in previous Thematic Reviews into structured products. However, the requirements are ultimately the same and firms should already have these processes and controls in place.





Robust governance is dependent upon clear and accountable oversight at board level across the product lifecycle, from concept to post-sale analysis. To ensure the commitments made by decision-makers effectively filter down to product design, marketing and distribution, firms should have a product governance policy in place with clearly defined processes and responsibilities. In order to determine whether oversight is adequately robust, boards have a number of considerations to keep in mind.
The first consideration is to ensure that products are designed to meet an identified investor need. This means that prior to commencing the design of a product, firms should be undertaking suitable market analysis to assess the intended target market and the likely consumer need for the product.
It is imperative that firms are able to provide evidence that investors are at the heart of all decisions made regarding new products, with any potential risks identified, managed and disclosed. This may include modeling whether the stated performance is likely to be achieved and whether the proposed distribution channels are appropriate for the target market.
Asset management firms are responsible for ensuring investors are adequately supported in choosing suitable funds, particularly if they are available on a non-advised basis. To achieve this, firms should have a clear launch strategy for new products and all communication with investors and their advisers should be conducted in a clear, fair and non-misleading manner, with appropriate transparency and disclosure.
Product providers should consider the risks to the end consumer when producing marketing materials and selecting distribution channels. Once again, achieving this successfully and compliantly relies on having conducted robust market analysis and understanding how and why investors choose or have certain funds recommended to them.
Effective product governance cannot be achieved if asset managers do not undertake regular reviews of their products to check whether they are performing in line with their stated objectives. A review should include relevant product stress testing to assess whether the risk to consumers is as stated in the product documentation. It should include an analysis of whether the stated objectives of the fund are being met along with a review of all distribution channels and their performance. Lastly it should also include a review of marketing materials to ensure they are up-to-date and provide investors and their advisers with clear information to assess the product.
In addition to internal product governance reviews, consideration should also be given to a wider compliance review examining conduct risk within the firm’s business model, culture, product governance and distribution process. This will be most effective and meaningful if carried out in partnership with an independent consultancy.
