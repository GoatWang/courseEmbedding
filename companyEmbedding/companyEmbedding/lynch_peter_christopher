                  Professional Profile
                
Before Brock Peters was inducted into the financial industry, a financial advisor once told him, “Helping clients achieve their dreams is one of the best feelings you will experience.” With his experience and passion for helping others, this industry has been a great, natural fit. Meeting new people and understanding their needs not only from a financial perspective, but from a personal perspective continues to be very rewarding for Brock in helping them towards their dreams.Since Brock started with Merrill Lynch in 2012 as a Financial Advisor, he has found innovative ways to connect all pieces of each clients’ financial lives to help them achieve their goals. Clients are typically higher net worth business owners, families and individuals who need a financial professional to help them plan for the long term.Brock offers both the intimacy and personalized attention of a boutique and the global resources of one of the world’s largest financial services firms. Brock also places a premium on providing attentive and tailored client service combined with sound financial advice and guidance.
Community Involvement•Board member, Susan G Komen, Fort Worth Young Professionals•Volunteer, Bike MS Rider, National Multiple Sclerosis Society•Modern Contemporaries of Fort Worth•University of Arkansas Alumni Club•Fort Worth Club MemberOutside of the office, Brock enjoys many sports, specifically basketball, golf and tennis. He lives in Fort Worth, loves traveling and competing in various road bike and mountain bike rides.

The last few episodes could only have been written by someone deranged by drug abuse.Nevertheless I shall look forward to seeing Season One at least.You may be interested to know that at the height of the show's popularity an audio tape was made of actor Ron Perlman reading romantic poetry. He had to wear the full lion's-head makeup to do the tape, otherwise his voice sounded different. The tape was a smash hit, especially with guys as gifts for their girlfriends. The then elderly owner of Toronto's biggest record store "Sam the Record Man" commented that he never could have imagined his greatest-ever seller would be a tape of a man in a cat suit quoting poetry. Go figure!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA MASTERPIECE!  The most magical, hopeful and intimately romantic television series ever!ByJ. Samison November 23, 2006Format: DVDWhat an amazing gift from Paramount. Devoted fans of this beloved television series have waited sixteen years for this DVD release. It has been a difficult sixteen years, watching one mediocre show after another gain release while this treasure sat gathering dust in some vault. Amidst a torrent of fan mail, petitions and frantic pleas prayers have finally been answered.No words of mine can possibly convey how special "Beauty and the Beast" was, and is. It was a phenomenon in 1986, and remains so today. CBS was gusty and wise to place this poetic stunner, starring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton, on its blockbuster Friday night schedule at 8 pm, a leader to rating winners Dallas and Falcon Crest. The on-screen chemistry shared by its actors was the stuff dreams are made of. I have never found in all the years since a cast so seemingly kissed by the gods, if you will."Beauty and the Beast" came out of nowhere in the sense that it was entirely unique to broadcast-commercial television. To turn on a major network at 8 pm and find the music Schubert, the sonnets of Shakespeare, all melded into a classically timeless tale of romantic yearning was nothing short of miraculous. To be gifted such a gem on PBS, on the original A&E or even on the big screen might have been plausible. Sadly, Hamilton's departure at the end of season two marked a serious and dark turn for the series. It could never recover its artistic integrity or ratings in season three and was sadly, though rightfully cancelled. With all due respect to Perlman's immense talent the magic was lost with the killing of Hamilton's character. WHAT WERE THE WRITERS THINKING? Even at this saddest, lowest point the series was still far better than anything else to be found on the tube.I am grateful to Paramount for buying the rights from Republic Pictures. I can only hope that seasons two and three will follow.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsWonderful show, DVD set disappointingByKaren Divortyon February 20, 2007Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseI was so excited to get my Beauty and the Beast DVD set. Unfortunately the transfer on it is lackluster. It is pretty clear that there was no care taken to this beloved show. Unfortunately the picture is often grainy and dull, especially the pilot episode which was especially bad! A minor quibble would be that there is no special features. The only thing I really loved was the case, nicely designed artwork and a single plastic case that holds all 6 DVD's! I say if you really love this show get the set, its better than nothing. However I plan to write a letter to CBS/ Paramount Home Entertainment to complain. Most fans have been waiting for this set for 20 years, it deserves more than this!Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Series. No Special Features/GoodiesByD. K. Duvalon March 14, 2007Format: DVDI was only a young teenager when this series first aired. I loved it and have been hoping to find it on DVD for so long. I was probably one the first customers to order it.My only complaint is that there are no special features at all! No language/subtitle options. No extra info. on the cast and crew or the making of the series. Must admit as much as I enjoyed reliving the magic, I was disappointed with the absence of "goodies". As an eager fan, you look for these extras to quench your thirst for "more" than what you originally watched on TV.Hopefully the next season will include such material.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsBeautiful fairytale seriesByDesireeon January 8, 2011Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseAnyone who watched this show when it originally aired fell in love with the ideals, the concept, and the hope that ran through every episode. In a world filled with darkness and deceit, and corruption, these two people were like a beacon of hope and light... proving what romantics everywhere have always known - love can overcome all adverisities, and create its own magic. Revisiting the show now, years later, that message is just as powerful, just as thought-provoking, and yes, just as romantic and filled with hope and joy. Timeless entertainment with the power to make your dreams take flight....Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsTHE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROMANTIC SERIES EVER MADE!ByLinda B.on February 19, 2007Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThey are no other series compared to this one,what a beautiful love story between Vincent and Kathryn.
