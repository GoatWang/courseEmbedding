At the advertised rate of % (APR %) with % points, which are included in the total closing costs of , the monthly payment would be  for the first 60 months. Beginning at month 61, assuming a new interest rate of %, the new payment would be  until the next annual change date.

After the 5-year fixed period, the payments, interest rate and annual percentage rate may increase or decrease.EXAMPLE: a $2,000,000 loan with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and an applicant FICO score of 720 or above, for a purchase transaction of an owner-occupied, one-unit, single family residence in California. At the advertised rate of % (APR %) with % points, which are included in the total closing costs of , the monthly payment would be  for the first 60 months. Beginning at month 61, assuming a new interest rate of %, the new payment would be  until the next annual change date. The rate and payment may change annually based on changes to the index value.Important DisclosuresThe above example for payments beginning at month 61 was calculated using the 1 Year LIBOR index rate of %, a margin of %, and assumes that the 1 Year LIBOR index remains unchanged for the life of the loan.

After the 5-year fixed period, the payments, interest rate and annual percentage rate may increase or decrease.EXAMPLE: a $2,000,000 loan with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and an applicant FICO score of 720 or above, for a purchase transaction of an owner-occupied, one-unit, single family residence in California. At the advertised rate of % (APR %) with % points, which are included in the total closing costs of , the monthly payment would be  for the first 60 months. Beginning at month 61, assuming a new interest rate of %, the new payment would be  until the next annual change date. The rate and payment may change annually based on changes to the index value.Important DisclosuresThe above example for payments beginning at month 61 was calculated using the 1 Year LIBOR index rate of %, a margin of %, and assumes that the 1 Year LIBOR index remains unchanged for the life of the loan.

                Citigroup, Morgan Stanley also avoiding deals with China firm
            



                Banks said to find it hard to get internal approvals to lend

Bank of America Corp. has told investment bankers to stop working on transactions with HNA Group Co. for now amid growing concerns about the acquisitive Chinese conglomerate’s debt levels and ownership structure, according to people familiar with the matter.The U.S. investment bank joins other Wall Street firms, including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley, that are largely steering clear of advising and financing the group on deals because they are unable to get internal approvals from “know your customer” committees, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.Senior officials at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit communicated internally last month that bankers shouldn’t currently pitch for new acquisitions and fundraisings, the people said. Scrutiny of Chinese companies came into focus this week after people familiar with the matter said that China plans to cut off some funding for billionaire Wang Jianlin’s Dalian Wanda Group Co., concluding the conglomerate breached restrictions for overseas investments.








An internal memo at Bank of America on holding off on deals with HNA for now went to fewer than five bankers who would be in a position to solicit business from the Chinese company, another person familiar with the matter said. The New York Times reported earlier that Bank of America had said in an internal email that it had decided to remove itself from transactions with HNA.Bank of America had advised HNA on several attempted overseas acquisitions in the past few years, people said. The decision has affected deals the firm was working on for HNA, including the planned Singapore IPO of HNA Commercial REIT, two of the people said. Banks regularly reassess their comfort with potential clients, and their stance toward HNA could change, they said.HNA hasn’t done significant fee-paying business with Bank of America in recent months, one person with knowledge of the company said.




Citigroup’s and Morgan Stanley’s internal committees have also struggled to get sufficient clarity on the source of funds and ownership structures at HNA, leading those banks to avoid deals for some time, the people said. Still, some firms that shy away from the parent company are willing to do business with HNA units. Morgan Stanley was one of the banks that committed to a total $8.5 billion in financing for Avolon, a business owned by one of HNA’s listed arms, in its purchase of CIT Group Inc.’s airline leasing business last year.“HNA Group partners actively with many global investment banks and continues to do so,” the conglomerate said in an emailed statement. “We carefully select our financial advisers and financing sources on each transaction, based on specific capabilities and expertise, consistent with our commitment to global best practices.”




Representatives for Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Support from Western banks has helped fuel a debt-backed buying spree by HNA, as it expanded from its home base on China’s sunny Hainan island to add logistics, hotel and financial assets around the globe, including a $6.5 billion deal to buy a stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. announced last year. Chinese regulators have begun assessing local banks’ loan exposure to HNA and are examining examples of acquisitions gone awry, people with knowledge of the matter have said.HNA Group International Co.’s 2018 bonds fell to a record low on Thursday.JPMorgan, UBSStill, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG have financed and advised on large HNA deals this year, notably the Hilton stake and the firm’s acquisition of a 10 percent stake in German lender Deutsche Bank AG.Click here to read a QuickTake on China’s crackdown on overseas investments.Even UBS, which has historically helped HNA on multiple transactions, has started monitoring the conglomerate’s debt levels more closely, separate people said. The Swiss bank is increasingly concerned that the Chinese company would struggle in the short term to complete large acquisitions, according to one of the people. UBS continues to do business with HNA, though its internal risk and compliance teams have begun asking more questions about dealings with the Chinese firm, another person said.UBS advised HNA on its $1.5 billion acquisition of Gategroup Holding AG, which completed this year. The Swiss lender has been one of the most active bankers for HNA, advising the firm on almost $15 billion of aviation-related acquisitions since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also provided collar financing to help the conglomerate increase its stake in Deutsche Bank, people familiar with the matter said in May.A spokesman for UBS declined to comment.Paris GalaThe pushback comes as HNA has been working to raise its profile in the West, hosting the French Open tennis tournament this year, a first for the firm. Executives including Executive Chairman Li Xianhua and Chief Executive Officer Adam Tan kicked off with a gala celebration in Le Petit Palais in Paris that included politicians, bankers and celebrity chef Joel Robuchon.HNA has recently told bankers it plans to slow the pace of its overseas dealmaking, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. The move comes as acquisitive Chinese companies are under increasing scrutiny at home. The China Banking Regulatory Commission asked some banks to provide information on overseas loans made to Dalian Wanda, Anbang Insurance Group Co., HNA, Fosun International Ltd. and the Chinese owner of Italian soccer team AC Milan, people familiar with the matter said in June.China is working to cut capital outflows that may be heaping pressure on the value of the yuan, and late last year moved to temporarily restrict the largest deals valued at $10 billion or more, people familiar with the matter said at the time.Chinese buyers have agreed to spend $94.4 billion on overseas deals so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down 37 percent from the same period in 2016.Financing PracticesHNA’s ownership is difficult to decipher as the group is held together through scores of companies -- mostly unlisted entities with little available public information -- holding stakes in each other. Atop the hierarchy is a person named Guan Jun, according to Chinese corporate filings.Little is known about Guan. HNA plays down his role, with CEO Adam Tan saying he’s just a Chinese businessman and Chairman Chen Feng telling the South China Morning Post newspaper that Guan isn’t a significant shareholder as he only owns a “tiny” stake. Yet Guan owns the equivalent of a 29 percent stake in the group, more than any of HNA’s executives including Chen and Tan’s stakes combined, the filings show.HNA’s ownership has also been under attack from Guo Wengui, a fugitive Chinese tycoon who’s been alleging HNA has secret ties to powerful Communist Party officials -- claims denied by the company. Guo is facing defamation lawsuits from HNA and others over his various claims.Its governance has drawn questions from the likes of the New York Times, which on Wednesday reported that HNA has been doing business deals with family and friends of its top executives in the past quarter century, with limited disclosure to investors. In response to the article, HNA said its related-party transactions are reviewed and documented on terms consistent with appropriate standards.

HNA’s financing practices have also stood out. Its latest annual report says the company is saddled with $73 billion of debt, which would the second-highest debt level for a non-financial corporation in China if HNA were to be listed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. What’s more, HNA filings show HNA and its units have pledged at least $24 billion of shares across 15 publicly traded firms to finance its acquisitions, signaling a pattern of reliance on pledged assets that’s triggered concerns from credit-rating agencies and analysts. HNA has said it has consulted financial advisers on all its pledge transactions.— With assistance by Aaron Kirchfeld, Prudence Ho, Laura J Keller, Joyce Koh, Crystal Tse, Andrea Tan, Dinesh Nair, Cathy Chan, and Young-Sam Cho

Joint Entrance Examinations: NEET papers to be same for all languages: Javadekar | Kolkata News - Times of India
			


   
Indiatimes|The Times of India|The Economic Times: HI, My TimesLOGOUTSign InCityNews » City News » Kolkata News » Schools & Colleges » NEET papers to be same for all languages: JavadekarNEET papers to be same for all languages: JavadekarSomdatta Basu | TNN | Jul 23, 2017, 03:37 AM ISTPrakash Javadekar

  KOLKATA: Union human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday made important announcements in Kolkata that will affect the fortunes of millions of students appearing in joint entrance examinations in medicine and engineering countrywide.
  

  Allaying fears of thousands of students appearing for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) — the all-India examination for entrance to medical colleges — in regional languages, Javadekar said the vernacular question papers of the examination will be a mere translation of the question paper in English. This year, the CBSE had set different sets of questions for students appearing for the examination in different languages, with students complaining that the vernacular papers, including the one in Bengali, were much tougher than the English and Hindi papers.
  

  The controversy over the mismatch in question papers had led to delay in the announcement of the NEET res-ults with the Madras high court ordering a stay on the declaration of results after a group of students in Tamil Nadu filed a petition alleging discrimination.
  

  The HRD minister also set to rest speculations on the introduction of a common engineering examination on the lines of NEET from next year, clarifying that no decision had been taken yet. "We are waiting to see the final result of NEET. The One Nation One Test in Engineering is at a discussion stage now," he said. Bengal and Tamil Nadu had opposed the proposal, cit-ing central over-reach in education, which is a state subject. The higher education secretary of Bengal had flagged dissent at a meeting in Delhi earlier this year, citing disparity in science curriculum in the Higher Secondary and NCERT syllabus, lack of clarity on reservation for students from Bengal, and the issue of question paper in regional languages.
  

  This year's NEET was held in 10 languages. Altogether, 56,079 candidates appeared for the examination in Bengal, of whom 40,000 took the exam in Bengali.
  

  Immediately after the examination, state education minister Partha Chatterjee had shot off a letter to the HRD minister pointing out that Bengali students had been disadvantaged despite the Centre's promise that there would be no bias. The HRD ministry had immediately forwarded the letter to CBSE, the examination conducting body, asking why different sets of questions had been set. In response, CBSE had cited security problems given the sheer number of candidates and the large number of languages involved if it resorted to translations.
  

  But the HRD ministry appears to have shot down CBSE's argument. "From next year, there will be mere translation of papers so that such problems do not arise," Javadekar assured on Saturday. he was speaking at a symposium inthe city.
  

  Sk Mehdi Hassan, a student who took NEET 2017 in Bengali and had slumped into depression after securing an all-India ranking of 88,000, welcomed Javadekar's announcement and said he was encouraged to appear for next year's NEET. "At least, students will now have a level-playing field and not face an unjust advantage compared to English language students," he said.
  

  Amiya Maity, a former teacher at SSKM Hospital, was happy with the decision but said one problem would still have to be ironed out. "During the framing of question paper by CBSE, there are no experts from Bengal with a good knowledge of HS syllabus. As a result, state students will always be at a disadvantage," he pointed out.
  

  But education minister Partha Chatterjee is still miffed with the Centre. "This year's NEET fiasco left thousands of students in the lurch. Their decision will be implemented from next year. What about the Bengali-medium students who suffered this year," he asked. "The minister's go-slow policy on one nation one test in engineering shows that they admit that there is a major infrastructure deficiency in the country in technology colleges and that HRD is not prepared to take the test," he added.
  

  The Bengal government had viewed it as Centre's over-reach in education that was a state subject.
  

  "Bengal feels such a policy does not go well with the consitution's unity in diversity model. We will strongly oppose the proposal since we feel it will be detremental to the future of our students and our expansion policy," Partha Chatterjee had said. The department secretary had flagged the dissent at a meeting held in Delhi earlier this year, citing the disparity in science curriculum in Higher Secondary and NCERT syllabus; lack of clarity on reservation for students from Bengal; and laguage problem.

History[edit]
On February 11, 1908, Henry Ittleson founded the Commercial Credit and Investment Company in St. Louis, Missouri.[5]
In 1915, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and renamed itself Commercial Investment Trust and went by the initials of C.I.T. By that time, the company provided financing for wholesale suppliers and producers of consumer goods.[5] The company added automobile financing to its product line in 1916, through an agreement with Studebaker, the first of its kind in the auto industry. During World War I, CIT financed the manufacture of 150 submarine chasers.[5] It also added consumer financing of radios through an agreement with Thomas Edison, Inc. During the Roaring 20s following the war, consumer spending rose dramatically and CIT prospered in its consumer appliance, furniture, and automobile financing groups.[5] In 1924, CIT incorporated in Delaware and listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5] CIT entered the field of factoring in 1928 and expanded operations into Europe in 1929.
With international tensions rising prior to World War II, CIT closed its German operations in 1934. Arthur O. Dietz succeeded Ittleson as president of the company in 1939. During the war, CIT offered its 2000 employees a month's bonus, life insurance, and a guaranteed job on return if they served in the United States Armed Forces. Between 1947 and 1950, the company's net income rose from $7.3 million to $30.8 million.[5] Ittleson died at age 77 on October 27, 1948.[5]
The company moved into a new building at 650 Madison Avenue in Manhattan in 1957.[5] In 1960, Walter Lundell succeeded Dietz as president of the company.[5] Five years later, in 1959, the company passed $100 billion ($822 billion in recent terms) in financing volume since its founding.[5] The Vietnam War racial turmoil of the 1960s resulted in CIT making changes to its business. In 1969, CIT entered the personal and home equity loan and leasing business and left auto financing.[5] In 1979, restrictive banking rules forced CIT to sell its bank, National Bank of North America.[5] CIT was acquired by RCA Corporation in 1980.[5] RCA promptly sold CIT's four manufacturing businesses: Picker X-Ray, Inc., Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc., All-Steel, Inc. (office furniture), and Raco, Inc. (wall boxes for electric switches and outlets.)[5] The Madison Avenue building was sold in 1982 as the company moved to a newly constructed headquarters facility in Livingston, New Jersey in 1983.[5]
Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi[edit]
In 1984, CIT was sold to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.[5] In 1989, Manufacturers Hanover Trust sold 60% of CIT to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.[5]
1990s[edit]
In 1991, the company acquired Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, which increased its services to small businesses.[5] In 1992, CIT opened 15 new offices in 7 states.[5]
In 1997, the company raised $850 million in an initial public offering and became a public company.[5][6]
On November 15, 1999, CIT acquired Toronto-based Newcourt Credit Group in a $4.2 billion transaction, which created one of the largest publicly owned leasing companies.[7][8] The following year, CIT announced record earnings of $611.6 million, an increase of 57.1% from the prior year, which was largely attributed to the acquisition of Newcourt the year before.[9]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Tyco acquired CIT for $9.2 billion in stock.[10][11][12] CIT was renamed as Tyco Capital.[13]
Tyco ran into operating troubles and sold or spun off non-core operations, including CIT. On July 8, 2002, Tyco completed its divestment of its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, via the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group Inc.[14][15]
Relisting[edit]
CIT moved its global headquarters back to New York City, opening a new headquarters in 2006 across from the New York Public Library.[16][17] CIT retained its Livingston campus as its corporate headquarters.
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Peek, assets at CIT jumped 77% from 2004 to the end of 2007 as it acquired companies in education lending and subprime mortgages. Those acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the company and in the following eight quarters, CIT reported more than $3 billion in losses.[18]
On July 1, 2008, CIT Group announced that it would sell its home lending division to Lone Star Funds for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $4.4 billion in debt and announced that it would sell its manufactured housing loan portfolio, with a face value of $470 million in loans, to Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for approximately $300 million.[19][20][21]
Late 2000s financial crisis[edit]
In 2008, CIT became a bank holding company in order to receive $2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On July 15, 2009, CIT's request for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation loan guarantees was rejected.[22] At 6:03 PM, the company issued a press release stating that talks of a government bailout were unlikely and that the company had been advised that there was "no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term"[23] and that it was very close to declaring bankruptcy.[24][25][26]
On July 19, 2009, the company was rescued in a $3 billion deal via an agreement with the bondholders group, which included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and other large bond holders.[27] CIT said it planned a comprehensive restructuring of its liabilities.[28]
Effective July 24, 2009, CIT was replaced in the S&P 500 stock market index by Red Hat.[29]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On Sunday, November 1, 2009, CIT Group filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.[30][31][32]
On December 10, 2009, CIT satisfied all of the conditions required to consummate the prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, which included the cancellation of existing debt and shares and the issuance of new debt and publicly traded shares.[33]
Management changes post-bankruptcy[edit]
As part of the reorganization plan, CIT named seven new independent directors. On January 19, 2010, Peter J. Tobin, a member of the board of directors, was named interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jeff Peek, who resigned effective January 15, 2010.[34] On February 8, 2010, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain was hired as chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[35]
S&P Upgrades[edit]
S&P upgraded the firm's ratings to BB- on March 9, 2012, three levels below investment grade. Analysts Brendan Browne and Rian Pressman stated that CIT "has repaid or refinanced a material portion of its high-cost debt, increased deposits, and moved many U.S. originations to its commercial bank subsidiary, CIT Bank".[36][37]
Acquisition of OneWest Bank[edit]
On July 22, 2014, CIT Group announced an agreement to acquire OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock.[38] The California Reinvestment Coalition was concerned about the possibility of the FDIC's loss-sharing agreement with OneWest being transferred to CIT Group and the growth of a bank that is considered too big to fail and so it filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2014 seeking information about the amount of money paid out to OneWest's investors under the loss-share agreement and what conversations FDIC staff have had with the leadership of OneWest Bank and CIT Group.[39] On July 21, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group's acquisition of OneWest Bank.[40] The acquisition closed on August 3, 2015.[41]
Resignation of CEO Thain[edit]
Effective November 1, 2015, CEO John Thain resigned and was replaced by Ellen Alemany, a member of the board of directors.[42][43][44]
On February 19, 2016, Thain resigned as chairman and Ellen Alemany became chairwoman in addition to CEO.[45][46]

History[edit]
On February 11, 1908, Henry Ittleson founded the Commercial Credit and Investment Company in St. Louis, Missouri.[5]
In 1915, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and renamed itself Commercial Investment Trust and went by the initials of C.I.T. By that time, the company provided financing for wholesale suppliers and producers of consumer goods.[5] The company added automobile financing to its product line in 1916, through an agreement with Studebaker, the first of its kind in the auto industry. During World War I, CIT financed the manufacture of 150 submarine chasers.[5] It also added consumer financing of radios through an agreement with Thomas Edison, Inc. During the Roaring 20s following the war, consumer spending rose dramatically and CIT prospered in its consumer appliance, furniture, and automobile financing groups.[5] In 1924, CIT incorporated in Delaware and listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5] CIT entered the field of factoring in 1928 and expanded operations into Europe in 1929.
With international tensions rising prior to World War II, CIT closed its German operations in 1934. Arthur O. Dietz succeeded Ittleson as president of the company in 1939. During the war, CIT offered its 2000 employees a month's bonus, life insurance, and a guaranteed job on return if they served in the United States Armed Forces. Between 1947 and 1950, the company's net income rose from $7.3 million to $30.8 million.[5] Ittleson died at age 77 on October 27, 1948.[5]
The company moved into a new building at 650 Madison Avenue in Manhattan in 1957.[5] In 1960, Walter Lundell succeeded Dietz as president of the company.[5] Five years later, in 1959, the company passed $100 billion ($822 billion in recent terms) in financing volume since its founding.[5] The Vietnam War racial turmoil of the 1960s resulted in CIT making changes to its business. In 1969, CIT entered the personal and home equity loan and leasing business and left auto financing.[5] In 1979, restrictive banking rules forced CIT to sell its bank, National Bank of North America.[5] CIT was acquired by RCA Corporation in 1980.[5] RCA promptly sold CIT's four manufacturing businesses: Picker X-Ray, Inc., Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc., All-Steel, Inc. (office furniture), and Raco, Inc. (wall boxes for electric switches and outlets.)[5] The Madison Avenue building was sold in 1982 as the company moved to a newly constructed headquarters facility in Livingston, New Jersey in 1983.[5]
Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi[edit]
In 1984, CIT was sold to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.[5] In 1989, Manufacturers Hanover Trust sold 60% of CIT to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.[5]
1990s[edit]
In 1991, the company acquired Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, which increased its services to small businesses.[5] In 1992, CIT opened 15 new offices in 7 states.[5]
In 1997, the company raised $850 million in an initial public offering and became a public company.[5][6]
On November 15, 1999, CIT acquired Toronto-based Newcourt Credit Group in a $4.2 billion transaction, which created one of the largest publicly owned leasing companies.[7][8] The following year, CIT announced record earnings of $611.6 million, an increase of 57.1% from the prior year, which was largely attributed to the acquisition of Newcourt the year before.[9]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Tyco acquired CIT for $9.2 billion in stock.[10][11][12] CIT was renamed as Tyco Capital.[13]
Tyco ran into operating troubles and sold or spun off non-core operations, including CIT. On July 8, 2002, Tyco completed its divestment of its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, via the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group Inc.[14][15]
Relisting[edit]
CIT moved its global headquarters back to New York City, opening a new headquarters in 2006 across from the New York Public Library.[16][17] CIT retained its Livingston campus as its corporate headquarters.
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Peek, assets at CIT jumped 77% from 2004 to the end of 2007 as it acquired companies in education lending and subprime mortgages. Those acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the company and in the following eight quarters, CIT reported more than $3 billion in losses.[18]
On July 1, 2008, CIT Group announced that it would sell its home lending division to Lone Star Funds for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $4.4 billion in debt and announced that it would sell its manufactured housing loan portfolio, with a face value of $470 million in loans, to Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for approximately $300 million.[19][20][21]
Late 2000s financial crisis[edit]
In 2008, CIT became a bank holding company in order to receive $2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On July 15, 2009, CIT's request for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation loan guarantees was rejected.[22] At 6:03 PM, the company issued a press release stating that talks of a government bailout were unlikely and that the company had been advised that there was "no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term"[23] and that it was very close to declaring bankruptcy.[24][25][26]
On July 19, 2009, the company was rescued in a $3 billion deal via an agreement with the bondholders group, which included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and other large bond holders.[27] CIT said it planned a comprehensive restructuring of its liabilities.[28]
Effective July 24, 2009, CIT was replaced in the S&P 500 stock market index by Red Hat.[29]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On Sunday, November 1, 2009, CIT Group filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.[30][31][32]
On December 10, 2009, CIT satisfied all of the conditions required to consummate the prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, which included the cancellation of existing debt and shares and the issuance of new debt and publicly traded shares.[33]
Management changes post-bankruptcy[edit]
As part of the reorganization plan, CIT named seven new independent directors. On January 19, 2010, Peter J. Tobin, a member of the board of directors, was named interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jeff Peek, who resigned effective January 15, 2010.[34] On February 8, 2010, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain was hired as chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[35]
S&P Upgrades[edit]
S&P upgraded the firm's ratings to BB- on March 9, 2012, three levels below investment grade. Analysts Brendan Browne and Rian Pressman stated that CIT "has repaid or refinanced a material portion of its high-cost debt, increased deposits, and moved many U.S. originations to its commercial bank subsidiary, CIT Bank".[36][37]
Acquisition of OneWest Bank[edit]
On July 22, 2014, CIT Group announced an agreement to acquire OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock.[38] The California Reinvestment Coalition was concerned about the possibility of the FDIC's loss-sharing agreement with OneWest being transferred to CIT Group and the growth of a bank that is considered too big to fail and so it filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2014 seeking information about the amount of money paid out to OneWest's investors under the loss-share agreement and what conversations FDIC staff have had with the leadership of OneWest Bank and CIT Group.[39] On July 21, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group's acquisition of OneWest Bank.[40] The acquisition closed on August 3, 2015.[41]
Resignation of CEO Thain[edit]
Effective November 1, 2015, CEO John Thain resigned and was replaced by Ellen Alemany, a member of the board of directors.[42][43][44]
On February 19, 2016, Thain resigned as chairman and Ellen Alemany became chairwoman in addition to CEO.[45][46]

History[edit]
On February 11, 1908, Henry Ittleson founded the Commercial Credit and Investment Company in St. Louis, Missouri.[5]
In 1915, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and renamed itself Commercial Investment Trust and went by the initials of C.I.T. By that time, the company provided financing for wholesale suppliers and producers of consumer goods.[5] The company added automobile financing to its product line in 1916, through an agreement with Studebaker, the first of its kind in the auto industry. During World War I, CIT financed the manufacture of 150 submarine chasers.[5] It also added consumer financing of radios through an agreement with Thomas Edison, Inc. During the Roaring 20s following the war, consumer spending rose dramatically and CIT prospered in its consumer appliance, furniture, and automobile financing groups.[5] In 1924, CIT incorporated in Delaware and listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5] CIT entered the field of factoring in 1928 and expanded operations into Europe in 1929.
With international tensions rising prior to World War II, CIT closed its German operations in 1934. Arthur O. Dietz succeeded Ittleson as president of the company in 1939. During the war, CIT offered its 2000 employees a month's bonus, life insurance, and a guaranteed job on return if they served in the United States Armed Forces. Between 1947 and 1950, the company's net income rose from $7.3 million to $30.8 million.[5] Ittleson died at age 77 on October 27, 1948.[5]
The company moved into a new building at 650 Madison Avenue in Manhattan in 1957.[5] In 1960, Walter Lundell succeeded Dietz as president of the company.[5] Five years later, in 1959, the company passed $100 billion ($822 billion in recent terms) in financing volume since its founding.[5] The Vietnam War racial turmoil of the 1960s resulted in CIT making changes to its business. In 1969, CIT entered the personal and home equity loan and leasing business and left auto financing.[5] In 1979, restrictive banking rules forced CIT to sell its bank, National Bank of North America.[5] CIT was acquired by RCA Corporation in 1980.[5] RCA promptly sold CIT's four manufacturing businesses: Picker X-Ray, Inc., Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc., All-Steel, Inc. (office furniture), and Raco, Inc. (wall boxes for electric switches and outlets.)[5] The Madison Avenue building was sold in 1982 as the company moved to a newly constructed headquarters facility in Livingston, New Jersey in 1983.[5]
Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi[edit]
In 1984, CIT was sold to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.[5] In 1989, Manufacturers Hanover Trust sold 60% of CIT to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.[5]
1990s[edit]
In 1991, the company acquired Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, which increased its services to small businesses.[5] In 1992, CIT opened 15 new offices in 7 states.[5]
In 1997, the company raised $850 million in an initial public offering and became a public company.[5][6]
On November 15, 1999, CIT acquired Toronto-based Newcourt Credit Group in a $4.2 billion transaction, which created one of the largest publicly owned leasing companies.[7][8] The following year, CIT announced record earnings of $611.6 million, an increase of 57.1% from the prior year, which was largely attributed to the acquisition of Newcourt the year before.[9]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Tyco acquired CIT for $9.2 billion in stock.[10][11][12] CIT was renamed as Tyco Capital.[13]
Tyco ran into operating troubles and sold or spun off non-core operations, including CIT. On July 8, 2002, Tyco completed its divestment of its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, via the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group Inc.[14][15]
Relisting[edit]
CIT moved its global headquarters back to New York City, opening a new headquarters in 2006 across from the New York Public Library.[16][17] CIT retained its Livingston campus as its corporate headquarters.
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Peek, assets at CIT jumped 77% from 2004 to the end of 2007 as it acquired companies in education lending and subprime mortgages. Those acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the company and in the following eight quarters, CIT reported more than $3 billion in losses.[18]
On July 1, 2008, CIT Group announced that it would sell its home lending division to Lone Star Funds for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $4.4 billion in debt and announced that it would sell its manufactured housing loan portfolio, with a face value of $470 million in loans, to Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for approximately $300 million.[19][20][21]
Late 2000s financial crisis[edit]
In 2008, CIT became a bank holding company in order to receive $2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On July 15, 2009, CIT's request for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation loan guarantees was rejected.[22] At 6:03 PM, the company issued a press release stating that talks of a government bailout were unlikely and that the company had been advised that there was "no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term"[23] and that it was very close to declaring bankruptcy.[24][25][26]
On July 19, 2009, the company was rescued in a $3 billion deal via an agreement with the bondholders group, which included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and other large bond holders.[27] CIT said it planned a comprehensive restructuring of its liabilities.[28]
Effective July 24, 2009, CIT was replaced in the S&P 500 stock market index by Red Hat.[29]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On Sunday, November 1, 2009, CIT Group filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.[30][31][32]
On December 10, 2009, CIT satisfied all of the conditions required to consummate the prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, which included the cancellation of existing debt and shares and the issuance of new debt and publicly traded shares.[33]
Management changes post-bankruptcy[edit]
As part of the reorganization plan, CIT named seven new independent directors. On January 19, 2010, Peter J. Tobin, a member of the board of directors, was named interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jeff Peek, who resigned effective January 15, 2010.[34] On February 8, 2010, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain was hired as chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[35]
S&P Upgrades[edit]
S&P upgraded the firm's ratings to BB- on March 9, 2012, three levels below investment grade. Analysts Brendan Browne and Rian Pressman stated that CIT "has repaid or refinanced a material portion of its high-cost debt, increased deposits, and moved many U.S. originations to its commercial bank subsidiary, CIT Bank".[36][37]
Acquisition of OneWest Bank[edit]
On July 22, 2014, CIT Group announced an agreement to acquire OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock.[38] The California Reinvestment Coalition was concerned about the possibility of the FDIC's loss-sharing agreement with OneWest being transferred to CIT Group and the growth of a bank that is considered too big to fail and so it filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2014 seeking information about the amount of money paid out to OneWest's investors under the loss-share agreement and what conversations FDIC staff have had with the leadership of OneWest Bank and CIT Group.[39] On July 21, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group's acquisition of OneWest Bank.[40] The acquisition closed on August 3, 2015.[41]
Resignation of CEO Thain[edit]
Effective November 1, 2015, CEO John Thain resigned and was replaced by Ellen Alemany, a member of the board of directors.[42][43][44]
On February 19, 2016, Thain resigned as chairman and Ellen Alemany became chairwoman in addition to CEO.[45][46]

History[edit]
On February 11, 1908, Henry Ittleson founded the Commercial Credit and Investment Company in St. Louis, Missouri.[5]
In 1915, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and renamed itself Commercial Investment Trust and went by the initials of C.I.T. By that time, the company provided financing for wholesale suppliers and producers of consumer goods.[5] The company added automobile financing to its product line in 1916, through an agreement with Studebaker, the first of its kind in the auto industry. During World War I, CIT financed the manufacture of 150 submarine chasers.[5] It also added consumer financing of radios through an agreement with Thomas Edison, Inc. During the Roaring 20s following the war, consumer spending rose dramatically and CIT prospered in its consumer appliance, furniture, and automobile financing groups.[5] In 1924, CIT incorporated in Delaware and listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5] CIT entered the field of factoring in 1928 and expanded operations into Europe in 1929.
With international tensions rising prior to World War II, CIT closed its German operations in 1934. Arthur O. Dietz succeeded Ittleson as president of the company in 1939. During the war, CIT offered its 2000 employees a month's bonus, life insurance, and a guaranteed job on return if they served in the United States Armed Forces. Between 1947 and 1950, the company's net income rose from $7.3 million to $30.8 million.[5] Ittleson died at age 77 on October 27, 1948.[5]
The company moved into a new building at 650 Madison Avenue in Manhattan in 1957.[5] In 1960, Walter Lundell succeeded Dietz as president of the company.[5] Five years later, in 1959, the company passed $100 billion ($822 billion in recent terms) in financing volume since its founding.[5] The Vietnam War racial turmoil of the 1960s resulted in CIT making changes to its business. In 1969, CIT entered the personal and home equity loan and leasing business and left auto financing.[5] In 1979, restrictive banking rules forced CIT to sell its bank, National Bank of North America.[5] CIT was acquired by RCA Corporation in 1980.[5] RCA promptly sold CIT's four manufacturing businesses: Picker X-Ray, Inc., Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc., All-Steel, Inc. (office furniture), and Raco, Inc. (wall boxes for electric switches and outlets.)[5] The Madison Avenue building was sold in 1982 as the company moved to a newly constructed headquarters facility in Livingston, New Jersey in 1983.[5]
Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi[edit]
In 1984, CIT was sold to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.[5] In 1989, Manufacturers Hanover Trust sold 60% of CIT to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.[5]
1990s[edit]
In 1991, the company acquired Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, which increased its services to small businesses.[5] In 1992, CIT opened 15 new offices in 7 states.[5]
In 1997, the company raised $850 million in an initial public offering and became a public company.[5][6]
On November 15, 1999, CIT acquired Toronto-based Newcourt Credit Group in a $4.2 billion transaction, which created one of the largest publicly owned leasing companies.[7][8] The following year, CIT announced record earnings of $611.6 million, an increase of 57.1% from the prior year, which was largely attributed to the acquisition of Newcourt the year before.[9]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Tyco acquired CIT for $9.2 billion in stock.[10][11][12] CIT was renamed as Tyco Capital.[13]
Tyco ran into operating troubles and sold or spun off non-core operations, including CIT. On July 8, 2002, Tyco completed its divestment of its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, via the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group Inc.[14][15]
Relisting[edit]
CIT moved its global headquarters back to New York City, opening a new headquarters in 2006 across from the New York Public Library.[16][17] CIT retained its Livingston campus as its corporate headquarters.
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Peek, assets at CIT jumped 77% from 2004 to the end of 2007 as it acquired companies in education lending and subprime mortgages. Those acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the company and in the following eight quarters, CIT reported more than $3 billion in losses.[18]
On July 1, 2008, CIT Group announced that it would sell its home lending division to Lone Star Funds for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $4.4 billion in debt and announced that it would sell its manufactured housing loan portfolio, with a face value of $470 million in loans, to Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for approximately $300 million.[19][20][21]
Late 2000s financial crisis[edit]
In 2008, CIT became a bank holding company in order to receive $2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On July 15, 2009, CIT's request for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation loan guarantees was rejected.[22] At 6:03 PM, the company issued a press release stating that talks of a government bailout were unlikely and that the company had been advised that there was "no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term"[23] and that it was very close to declaring bankruptcy.[24][25][26]
On July 19, 2009, the company was rescued in a $3 billion deal via an agreement with the bondholders group, which included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and other large bond holders.[27] CIT said it planned a comprehensive restructuring of its liabilities.[28]
Effective July 24, 2009, CIT was replaced in the S&P 500 stock market index by Red Hat.[29]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On Sunday, November 1, 2009, CIT Group filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.[30][31][32]
On December 10, 2009, CIT satisfied all of the conditions required to consummate the prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, which included the cancellation of existing debt and shares and the issuance of new debt and publicly traded shares.[33]
Management changes post-bankruptcy[edit]
As part of the reorganization plan, CIT named seven new independent directors. On January 19, 2010, Peter J. Tobin, a member of the board of directors, was named interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jeff Peek, who resigned effective January 15, 2010.[34] On February 8, 2010, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain was hired as chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[35]
S&P Upgrades[edit]
S&P upgraded the firm's ratings to BB- on March 9, 2012, three levels below investment grade. Analysts Brendan Browne and Rian Pressman stated that CIT "has repaid or refinanced a material portion of its high-cost debt, increased deposits, and moved many U.S. originations to its commercial bank subsidiary, CIT Bank".[36][37]
Acquisition of OneWest Bank[edit]
On July 22, 2014, CIT Group announced an agreement to acquire OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock.[38] The California Reinvestment Coalition was concerned about the possibility of the FDIC's loss-sharing agreement with OneWest being transferred to CIT Group and the growth of a bank that is considered too big to fail and so it filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2014 seeking information about the amount of money paid out to OneWest's investors under the loss-share agreement and what conversations FDIC staff have had with the leadership of OneWest Bank and CIT Group.[39] On July 21, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group's acquisition of OneWest Bank.[40] The acquisition closed on August 3, 2015.[41]
Resignation of CEO Thain[edit]
Effective November 1, 2015, CEO John Thain resigned and was replaced by Ellen Alemany, a member of the board of directors.[42][43][44]
On February 19, 2016, Thain resigned as chairman and Ellen Alemany became chairwoman in addition to CEO.[45][46]

History[edit]
On February 11, 1908, Henry Ittleson founded the Commercial Credit and Investment Company in St. Louis, Missouri.[5]
In 1915, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and renamed itself Commercial Investment Trust and went by the initials of C.I.T. By that time, the company provided financing for wholesale suppliers and producers of consumer goods.[5] The company added automobile financing to its product line in 1916, through an agreement with Studebaker, the first of its kind in the auto industry. During World War I, CIT financed the manufacture of 150 submarine chasers.[5] It also added consumer financing of radios through an agreement with Thomas Edison, Inc. During the Roaring 20s following the war, consumer spending rose dramatically and CIT prospered in its consumer appliance, furniture, and automobile financing groups.[5] In 1924, CIT incorporated in Delaware and listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5] CIT entered the field of factoring in 1928 and expanded operations into Europe in 1929.
With international tensions rising prior to World War II, CIT closed its German operations in 1934. Arthur O. Dietz succeeded Ittleson as president of the company in 1939. During the war, CIT offered its 2000 employees a month's bonus, life insurance, and a guaranteed job on return if they served in the United States Armed Forces. Between 1947 and 1950, the company's net income rose from $7.3 million to $30.8 million.[5] Ittleson died at age 77 on October 27, 1948.[5]
The company moved into a new building at 650 Madison Avenue in Manhattan in 1957.[5] In 1960, Walter Lundell succeeded Dietz as president of the company.[5] Five years later, in 1959, the company passed $100 billion ($822 billion in recent terms) in financing volume since its founding.[5] The Vietnam War racial turmoil of the 1960s resulted in CIT making changes to its business. In 1969, CIT entered the personal and home equity loan and leasing business and left auto financing.[5] In 1979, restrictive banking rules forced CIT to sell its bank, National Bank of North America.[5] CIT was acquired by RCA Corporation in 1980.[5] RCA promptly sold CIT's four manufacturing businesses: Picker X-Ray, Inc., Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc., All-Steel, Inc. (office furniture), and Raco, Inc. (wall boxes for electric switches and outlets.)[5] The Madison Avenue building was sold in 1982 as the company moved to a newly constructed headquarters facility in Livingston, New Jersey in 1983.[5]
Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi[edit]
In 1984, CIT was sold to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.[5] In 1989, Manufacturers Hanover Trust sold 60% of CIT to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.[5]
1990s[edit]
In 1991, the company acquired Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, which increased its services to small businesses.[5] In 1992, CIT opened 15 new offices in 7 states.[5]
In 1997, the company raised $850 million in an initial public offering and became a public company.[5][6]
On November 15, 1999, CIT acquired Toronto-based Newcourt Credit Group in a $4.2 billion transaction, which created one of the largest publicly owned leasing companies.[7][8] The following year, CIT announced record earnings of $611.6 million, an increase of 57.1% from the prior year, which was largely attributed to the acquisition of Newcourt the year before.[9]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Tyco acquired CIT for $9.2 billion in stock.[10][11][12] CIT was renamed as Tyco Capital.[13]
Tyco ran into operating troubles and sold or spun off non-core operations, including CIT. On July 8, 2002, Tyco completed its divestment of its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, via the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group Inc.[14][15]
Relisting[edit]
CIT moved its global headquarters back to New York City, opening a new headquarters in 2006 across from the New York Public Library.[16][17] CIT retained its Livingston campus as its corporate headquarters.
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Peek, assets at CIT jumped 77% from 2004 to the end of 2007 as it acquired companies in education lending and subprime mortgages. Those acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the company and in the following eight quarters, CIT reported more than $3 billion in losses.[18]
On July 1, 2008, CIT Group announced that it would sell its home lending division to Lone Star Funds for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $4.4 billion in debt and announced that it would sell its manufactured housing loan portfolio, with a face value of $470 million in loans, to Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for approximately $300 million.[19][20][21]
Late 2000s financial crisis[edit]
In 2008, CIT became a bank holding company in order to receive $2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On July 15, 2009, CIT's request for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation loan guarantees was rejected.[22] At 6:03 PM, the company issued a press release stating that talks of a government bailout were unlikely and that the company had been advised that there was "no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term"[23] and that it was very close to declaring bankruptcy.[24][25][26]
On July 19, 2009, the company was rescued in a $3 billion deal via an agreement with the bondholders group, which included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and other large bond holders.[27] CIT said it planned a comprehensive restructuring of its liabilities.[28]
Effective July 24, 2009, CIT was replaced in the S&P 500 stock market index by Red Hat.[29]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On Sunday, November 1, 2009, CIT Group filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.[30][31][32]
On December 10, 2009, CIT satisfied all of the conditions required to consummate the prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, which included the cancellation of existing debt and shares and the issuance of new debt and publicly traded shares.[33]
Management changes post-bankruptcy[edit]
As part of the reorganization plan, CIT named seven new independent directors. On January 19, 2010, Peter J. Tobin, a member of the board of directors, was named interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jeff Peek, who resigned effective January 15, 2010.[34] On February 8, 2010, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain was hired as chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[35]
S&P Upgrades[edit]
S&P upgraded the firm's ratings to BB- on March 9, 2012, three levels below investment grade. Analysts Brendan Browne and Rian Pressman stated that CIT "has repaid or refinanced a material portion of its high-cost debt, increased deposits, and moved many U.S. originations to its commercial bank subsidiary, CIT Bank".[36][37]
Acquisition of OneWest Bank[edit]
On July 22, 2014, CIT Group announced an agreement to acquire OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock.[38] The California Reinvestment Coalition was concerned about the possibility of the FDIC's loss-sharing agreement with OneWest being transferred to CIT Group and the growth of a bank that is considered too big to fail and so it filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2014 seeking information about the amount of money paid out to OneWest's investors under the loss-share agreement and what conversations FDIC staff have had with the leadership of OneWest Bank and CIT Group.[39] On July 21, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group's acquisition of OneWest Bank.[40] The acquisition closed on August 3, 2015.[41]
Resignation of CEO Thain[edit]
Effective November 1, 2015, CEO John Thain resigned and was replaced by Ellen Alemany, a member of the board of directors.[42][43][44]
On February 19, 2016, Thain resigned as chairman and Ellen Alemany became chairwoman in addition to CEO.[45][46]

History[edit]
On February 11, 1908, Henry Ittleson founded the Commercial Credit and Investment Company in St. Louis, Missouri.[5]
In 1915, the company moved its headquarters to New York City and renamed itself Commercial Investment Trust and went by the initials of C.I.T. By that time, the company provided financing for wholesale suppliers and producers of consumer goods.[5] The company added automobile financing to its product line in 1916, through an agreement with Studebaker, the first of its kind in the auto industry. During World War I, CIT financed the manufacture of 150 submarine chasers.[5] It also added consumer financing of radios through an agreement with Thomas Edison, Inc. During the Roaring 20s following the war, consumer spending rose dramatically and CIT prospered in its consumer appliance, furniture, and automobile financing groups.[5] In 1924, CIT incorporated in Delaware and listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.[5] CIT entered the field of factoring in 1928 and expanded operations into Europe in 1929.
With international tensions rising prior to World War II, CIT closed its German operations in 1934. Arthur O. Dietz succeeded Ittleson as president of the company in 1939. During the war, CIT offered its 2000 employees a month's bonus, life insurance, and a guaranteed job on return if they served in the United States Armed Forces. Between 1947 and 1950, the company's net income rose from $7.3 million to $30.8 million.[5] Ittleson died at age 77 on October 27, 1948.[5]
The company moved into a new building at 650 Madison Avenue in Manhattan in 1957.[5] In 1960, Walter Lundell succeeded Dietz as president of the company.[5] Five years later, in 1959, the company passed $100 billion ($822 billion in recent terms) in financing volume since its founding.[5] The Vietnam War racial turmoil of the 1960s resulted in CIT making changes to its business. In 1969, CIT entered the personal and home equity loan and leasing business and left auto financing.[5] In 1979, restrictive banking rules forced CIT to sell its bank, National Bank of North America.[5] CIT was acquired by RCA Corporation in 1980.[5] RCA promptly sold CIT's four manufacturing businesses: Picker X-Ray, Inc., Gibson Greeting Cards, Inc., All-Steel, Inc. (office furniture), and Raco, Inc. (wall boxes for electric switches and outlets.)[5] The Madison Avenue building was sold in 1982 as the company moved to a newly constructed headquarters facility in Livingston, New Jersey in 1983.[5]
Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi[edit]
In 1984, CIT was sold to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.[5] In 1989, Manufacturers Hanover Trust sold 60% of CIT to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan.[5]
1990s[edit]
In 1991, the company acquired Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation, which increased its services to small businesses.[5] In 1992, CIT opened 15 new offices in 7 states.[5]
In 1997, the company raised $850 million in an initial public offering and became a public company.[5][6]
On November 15, 1999, CIT acquired Toronto-based Newcourt Credit Group in a $4.2 billion transaction, which created one of the largest publicly owned leasing companies.[7][8] The following year, CIT announced record earnings of $611.6 million, an increase of 57.1% from the prior year, which was largely attributed to the acquisition of Newcourt the year before.[9]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Tyco acquired CIT for $9.2 billion in stock.[10][11][12] CIT was renamed as Tyco Capital.[13]
Tyco ran into operating troubles and sold or spun off non-core operations, including CIT. On July 8, 2002, Tyco completed its divestment of its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, via the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group Inc.[14][15]
Relisting[edit]
CIT moved its global headquarters back to New York City, opening a new headquarters in 2006 across from the New York Public Library.[16][17] CIT retained its Livingston campus as its corporate headquarters.
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Peek, assets at CIT jumped 77% from 2004 to the end of 2007 as it acquired companies in education lending and subprime mortgages. Those acquisitions turned out to be disastrous for the company and in the following eight quarters, CIT reported more than $3 billion in losses.[18]
On July 1, 2008, CIT Group announced that it would sell its home lending division to Lone Star Funds for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $4.4 billion in debt and announced that it would sell its manufactured housing loan portfolio, with a face value of $470 million in loans, to Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance for approximately $300 million.[19][20][21]
Late 2000s financial crisis[edit]
In 2008, CIT became a bank holding company in order to receive $2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds.
On July 15, 2009, CIT's request for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation loan guarantees was rejected.[22] At 6:03 PM, the company issued a press release stating that talks of a government bailout were unlikely and that the company had been advised that there was "no appreciable likelihood of additional government support being provided over the near term"[23] and that it was very close to declaring bankruptcy.[24][25][26]
On July 19, 2009, the company was rescued in a $3 billion deal via an agreement with the bondholders group, which included Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) and other large bond holders.[27] CIT said it planned a comprehensive restructuring of its liabilities.[28]
Effective July 24, 2009, CIT was replaced in the S&P 500 stock market index by Red Hat.[29]
Bankruptcy[edit]
On Sunday, November 1, 2009, CIT Group filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code.[30][31][32]
On December 10, 2009, CIT satisfied all of the conditions required to consummate the prepackaged Plan of Reorganization, which included the cancellation of existing debt and shares and the issuance of new debt and publicly traded shares.[33]
Management changes post-bankruptcy[edit]
As part of the reorganization plan, CIT named seven new independent directors. On January 19, 2010, Peter J. Tobin, a member of the board of directors, was named interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jeff Peek, who resigned effective January 15, 2010.[34] On February 8, 2010, former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain was hired as chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[35]
S&P Upgrades[edit]
S&P upgraded the firm's ratings to BB- on March 9, 2012, three levels below investment grade. Analysts Brendan Browne and Rian Pressman stated that CIT "has repaid or refinanced a material portion of its high-cost debt, increased deposits, and moved many U.S. originations to its commercial bank subsidiary, CIT Bank".[36][37]
Acquisition of OneWest Bank[edit]
On July 22, 2014, CIT Group announced an agreement to acquire OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock.[38] The California Reinvestment Coalition was concerned about the possibility of the FDIC's loss-sharing agreement with OneWest being transferred to CIT Group and the growth of a bank that is considered too big to fail and so it filed a Freedom of Information Act request in October 2014 seeking information about the amount of money paid out to OneWest's investors under the loss-share agreement and what conversations FDIC staff have had with the leadership of OneWest Bank and CIT Group.[39] On July 21, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve approved CIT Group's acquisition of OneWest Bank.[40] The acquisition closed on August 3, 2015.[41]
Resignation of CEO Thain[edit]
Effective November 1, 2015, CEO John Thain resigned and was replaced by Ellen Alemany, a member of the board of directors.[42][43][44]
On February 19, 2016, Thain resigned as chairman and Ellen Alemany became chairwoman in addition to CEO.[45][46]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
