About Us



Our passion is empowering our clients.
From financial management and property taxes to courts and education, we create, deliver and support software solutions and services that make it easier for local governments and schools to manage their complex, day-to-day business functions. We have a unique vantage point due to our singular focus on serving the public sector with a broad product portfolio. 
From the courtroom to the classroom, Tyler’s products serve as the backbone for core business functions in the public sector. We are dedicated to helping our local government and school clients streamline the many aspects of their financial management, court case, property tax, public safety, citizen services, public records and education systems. 
However, our commitment goes well beyond delivering solutions that work for our public sector clients. It’s about consistently delivering value for employees and shareholders as well.
Our deep industry knowledge comes from our staff — many of whom held public sector positions prior to joining Tyler. They understand what clients want and need to operate more efficiently because they’ve been there. They transfer their subject matter expertise to new employees who in turn become experts themselves, eventually passing it along to others. 
With this knowledge and experience — along with focused innovation and an earnest commitment to our clients — we are positioned better than anyone to anticipate and address the changing technology needs of the public sector.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
