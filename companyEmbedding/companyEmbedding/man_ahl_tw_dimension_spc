TRADING STATEMENT for quarter ended 30 Sept 2015

RNS Number : 3119C Man Group plc 15 October 2015  


 
 

 
 
Press Release 
15 October 2015
 
TRADING STATEMENT for the quarter ended 30 September 2015
 
Key points
 
·     Funds under management (FUM) of $76.8 billion at 30 September 2015 (30 June 2015: $78.8 billion) 
o  Net inflows in the quarter of $1.4 billion, comprising sales of $5.7 billion and redemptions of $4.3 billion with net inflows into quant and discretionary strategies being partially offset by net outflows from fund of funds strategies 
o  Overall investment movement of negative $2.7 billion in the quarter driven by negative market movements in GLG's and Numeric's long only strategies, partially offset by positive performance across AHL's strategies 
o  FX translation effects of negative $0.6 billion in the quarter, driven by the strengthening of the US dollar against Sterling ($0.4 billion) and the Australian Dollar ($0.3 billion), partially offset by Japanese Yen strengthening against the US Dollar ($0.1 billion)
o  Other movements of negative $0.1 billion with CLO and guaranteed product maturities of $0.4 billion being partially offset by investment exposure adjustments of $0.3 billion 
·     Good year to date relative performance across the majority of strategies. Asset weighted net outperformance for GLG's long only and Numeric's strategies of approximately 2.1%1 and 3.7%1 respectively for the year to 30 September 2015  
 
Manny Roman, Chief Executive Officer of Man, said: 
"Despite the extreme market movements in late August impacting absolute performance across our long only strategies, we have seen good relative performance across the majority of our strategies for the year to date.  
 
The net inflow for the quarter was driven by flows into our quant strategies and we have a solid pipeline of sales in the near-term. Quarterly flows will continue to be lumpy in nature, particularly in respect of certain FRM managed account mandates that are yet to fund, and the exact timing of which remains to be confirmed. 
 
The political uncertainties and economic upheaval in parts of the world continue to provide a very challenging market backdrop for our business. Accordingly, the risk appetite of our clients may impact flows, but we remain focused on continuing to generate attractive investment returns across our range of strategies."

ALTERNATIVES
Quant
Quant alternative (AHL / Numeric) FUM grew by $2.2 billion during the quarter driven by positive performance and net inflows. The net inflow of $0.9 billion included $0.5 billion into Alpha, $0.3 billion into Dimension and $0.1 billion into other AHL styles. Performance was positive across the majority of AHL strategies which drove the $1.2 billion of investment movement, with Diversified up 9.7%, Alpha up 7.0%, Dimension up 7.4% and Evolution up 5.5% in the quarter. Negative FX movements of $0.2 billion were driven by the US dollar strengthening against the Australian dollar. Other movements of $0.3 billion related to investment exposure adjustments. As at 30 September 2015, 63% of AHL open ended funds were at high watermark and 18% were within 5% of high watermark. The weighted average distance from high watermark for AHL guaranteed funds was 12%.
 
Discretionary 
Discretionary alternatives (GLG) FUM decreased by $0.6 billion during the period with net inflows being more than offset by negative performance and maturities. The net inflow of $0.3 billion included $0.2 billion into equity long short strategies and $0.1 billion into credit strategies. Negative investment movement of $0.6 billion in the quarter was mainly due to negative performance in the North American equity strategy which is materially more directional than the other alternatives strategies and was impacted by declining equity markets. FX movements were negligible and CLO maturities were $0.3 billion in the period. As at 30 September 2015, 14% of GLG performance fee eligible FUM was at high watermark and 48% was within 5% of high watermark. 
 
 
 
 
Fund of funds
Alternative fund of funds (FRM) FUM reduced by $0.5 billion during the quarter. Sales of $0.5 billion included $0.2 billion from recently awarded managed account mandates. Redemptions of $0.8 billion included $0.3 billion from one client in an older managed account driven by an asset allocation decision, and $0.2 billion from one client in a segregated portfolio. Performance at FRM was negative overall which decreased FUM by $0.3 billion in the quarter. FX movements were negligible in the period and other movements of positive $0.1 billion related to investment exposure adjustments.  
 
LONG ONLY
Quant
Quant long only (Numeric / AHL) FUM decreased by $1.2 billion during the quarter with negative performance being partially offset by net inflows. The net inflows of $0.4 billion were mainly into Global strategies. The negative investment movement of $1.6 billion was primarily due to negative market performance in Global Core and Emerging Markets Core strategies, although both these strategies outperformed their respective benchmarks by 0.9% and 0.4% (net of fees) respectively for the quarter and the asset weighted outperformance against a blend of applicable benchmarks (net of fees) across Numeric's product range for the year to 30 September 2015 was strong at approximately 3.7%2.
 
Discretionary
Discretionary long only (GLG) FUM decreased by $1.7 billion mainly due to negative investment movement in the period. Net inflows were $0.1 billion, with $0.5 billion of inflows into the Japan CoreAlpha, European Equity and Undervalued Assets strategies being partially offset by $0.4 billion of outflows from Fixed Income strategies. Japan CoreAlpha was down 14.8% in the period (compared to the Topix which was down 13.5%), which was the main driver of the negative investment movement of $1.5 billion. However year to date performance across GLG's range of long only strategies as a whole has been good with asset weighted outperformance (ie. relative to the weighted performance of relevant reference indices, net of fees) of approximately 2.1%. FX movements of negative $0.3 billion in the quarter were due to the US dollar strengthening against sterling. 
 
GUARANTEED PRODUCTS
Guaranteed product funds under management decreased by $0.2 billion in the quarter to $1.5 billion. There were no guaranteed product launches and redemptions were minimal. Positive AHL performance added $0.1 billion to FUM and FX movements were negative $0.1 billion due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Australian dollar. The net de-gear in the period was $0.1 billion and there were maturities of $0.1 billion.
         
1&2 Numeric’s asset weighted alpha YTD as of 30/09/2015 is calculated using the asset weighted average of the performance relative to the benchmark for all non-restricted strategy composites available net of the highest management fees and, as applicable, performance fees that can be charged.

1) Represented by Man AHL Diversified plc from 26 March 1996 to 29 October 2012, and by Man AHL Diversified (Guernsey) USD Shares - Class A from 30 October 2012 to date. The representative product was changed at the end of October 2012 due to legal and/or regulatory restrictions on Man AHL Diversified plc preventing the product from accessing the Programme's revised target allocations. Both funds are valued weekly; however, for comparative purposes, statistics have been calculated using the best quality price that is available at each calendar month end, using estimates where a final price is unavailable. Where a price, either estimate or final is unavailable on a calendar month end, the price on the closest date prior to the calendar month end has been used.


 




 


2) Represented by AHL Alpha plc from 17 October 1995 to 30 September 2012, and by AHL Strategies PCC Limited: Class Y AHL Alpha USD Shares from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013. The representative product was changed at the end of September 2012 due to the provisioning of fund liquidation costs in October 2012 for AHL Alpha plc, which resulted in tracking error compared with other Alpha Programme funds. Both funds are valued weekly; however, for comparative purposes, statistics have been calculated using the best quality price that is available at each calendar month end, using estimates where a final price is unavailable. Where a price, either estimate or final is unavailable on a calendar month end, the price on the closest date prior to the calendar month end has been used.

Unless otherwise stated, returns are based on the performance of unrestricted accounts or share classes within each strategy, as applicable. Performance is net-of-fees unless otherwise stated. Returns of accounts with client restrictions may differ.




#The reference index listed by Numeric is intended to best represent the strategy's universe. Investors may choose to compare returns for their accounts to different reference indices, resulting in differences in relative return information. Comparison to an index is for informational purposes only, as the holdings of an account managed by Numeric will differ from the securities which comprise the index and may have greater volatility than the holdings of an index. 




 




Past or projected performance is no indication of future results. Returns may increase or decrease as a result of currency fluctuations.

  Press Release 

  20 April 2017 

  TRADING STATEMENT for the quarter ended 31 March 2017 

  Key points 

  --     Funds under management (FUM) of $88.7 billion at 31 March 2017 (31 December 2016: $80.9 billion) 

  --     Net inflows in the quarter of $3.0 billion, driven by strong inflows into discretionary long only and fund of fund alternatives 

   --     Positive investment movement of $2.2 billion in the quarter 

  --     Positive FX movements of $0.8 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by the weakening of the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, and Euro 

   --     The acquisition of Aalto was completed on 1 January 2017, which added $1.8 billion of FUM 

  Luke Ellis, Chief Executive Officer of Man Group, said: 

  "The first quarter of 2017 has been a strong period for Man Group, with funds under management increasing by 10% to $88.7 billion and growth in each of our investment engines. We came into the year with a good pipeline of interest from clients, and that has resulted in net inflows of $3.0 billion in the first three months. Investment performance increased FUM by $2.2 billion for the quarter and the completion of the Aalto acquisition added a further $1.8 billion. 

  Looking forward, the global environment has the potential to create alpha opportunities and we see continuing near-term interest from clients. However, it is important to recognise that this is only one quarter and, as we have said before, flows are likely to vary on a quarterly basis given the institutional nature of our business."

  ALTERNATIVES 

  Quant 

  Quant alternatives (AHL/Numeric) FUM increased by 5% during the quarter driven by net inflows, positive investment performance and FX movements. The net inflows of $0.8 billion included $0.3 billion into Numeric Market Neutral, $0.2 billion into Institutional Solutions, and $0.2 billion into Alpha.  Investment movement was marginally positive as the performance for Evolution (up 2.8%) and the Numeric alternative strategies was partially offset by negative performance for Diversified (down -1.8%), Alpha (down -0.9%) and Dimension (down -0.2%)(1) . Positive FX movements of $0.2 billion were a result of the US Dollar weakening against the Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar and Euro. As at 31 March 2017, 38% of AHL performance fee eligible open ended FUM was at high watermark and 26% was within 5% of high watermark. The weighted average distance from peak for all AHL performance fee eligible FUM was -6.8%. 

  Discretionary 

  Discretionary alternatives (GLG) FUM increased slightly during the quarter, with net outflows being offset by positive investment movement. The net outflows of $0.2 billion were mainly from the GLG Multi Strategy and Equity Long Short strategies. The positive investment movement of $0.2 billion in the quarter was due to positive performance across GLG's range of alternative strategies. As at 31 March 2017, 43% of GLG performance fee eligible FUM was at high watermark and 44% was within 5% of high watermark, of which around 60% crystallises on a semi-annual basis. 

   (1) Past performance is not an indication of future performance. Returns shown are net of fees. 

  Fund of funds 

  Fund of fund alternatives (FRM) FUM increased by $1.7 billion during the quarter as a result of net inflows, positive investment movement, FX, and other movements. Net flows mainly related to $1.4 billion into a segregated portfolio for a single client, partially offset by net outflows from traditional fund of fund strategies. Previously awarded infrastructure managed account mandates of $1.9 billion are yet to be funded, which are expected to come in during 2017. Investment movement was marginally positive for the quarter. Positive FX movements increased FUM by $0.2 billion due to the weakening of the US Dollar in the period against the Japanese Yen and Australian Dollar. The positive other movements related to investment exposure adjustments. 

  Global Private Markets 

  The acquisition of Aalto completed on 1 January 2017, which added $1.8 billion to funds under management. Net inflows of $0.1 billion for the quarter were broadly split between the real estate debt and direct real estate strategies. 

  LONG ONLY 

  Quant 

  Quant long only (Numeric) FUM increased by $1.3 billion during the quarter as a result of positive investment movement, partially offset by net outflows. The net outflows were mainly from the US Large Cap and Global Core strategies, partially offset by net inflows into the Emerging Market strategies. The asset weighted outperformance relative to a blend of applicable benchmarks (net of fees) across Numeric's product range was approximately 0.5%(2) for the quarter. 

  Discretionary 

  Discretionary long only (GLG) FUM increased by $2.0 billion due to net inflows, positive investment movement and positive FX movement in the period. Net inflows of $1.4 billion were primarily in relation to the Emerging Market Debt strategies. The positive investment movement of $0.3 billion was across the range of GLG long only strategies. Positive FX movements increased FUM by $0.3 billion, primarily due to the weakening of the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. 

  GUARANTEED PRODUCTS 

  Guaranteed product FUM decreased to $0.3 billion during the quarter as a result of negative investment movement. There were no guaranteed product launches during the period, and limited redemptions and maturities. 

  (2) Numeric's asset weighted alpha is calculated using the asset weighted average of the performance relative to the benchmark for all strategy composites available net of the highest rate of management fees charged and, as applicable, performance fees that can be charged.

      Shares from 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013. The representative 
      product was changed at the end of September 2012 due to the provisioning 
      of fund liquidation costs in October 2012 for AHL Alpha plc, 
      which resulted in tracking error compared with other Alpha Programme 
      funds. Both funds are valued weekly; however, for comparative 
      purposes, statistics have been calculated using the best quality 
      price that is available at each calendar month end, using estimates 
      where a final price is unavailable. Where a price, either estimate 
      or final is unavailable on a calendar month end, the price on 
      the closest date prior to the calendar month end has been used. 
      Both of the track records have been adjusted to reflect the fee 
      structure of AHL Alpha (Cayman) Limited - USD Shares. From 30

      was changed at the end of October 2012 due to legal and/or regulatory 
      restrictions on Man AHL Diversified plc preventing the product 
      from accessing the Programme's revised target allocations. Both 
      funds are valued weekly; however, for comparative purposes, statistics 
      have been calculated using the best quality price that is available

      For the period Jan 2004 to Feb 2004, the returns of the fund's 
      master portfolio have been used, adjusted for fees and/or currency, 
      where applicable. Post Feb 2004, the fund's actual performance 
      has been used, which may differ from the calculated performance 
      of the track record. There have been occasions where the 12-months' 
      performance to date of FRM Diversified II has differed materially 
      from that of AA Diversified. Strategy and holdings data relates 
      to the composition of the master portfolio.

Man Group plc  -  EMG   
Trading Statement for quarter ended 30 Sep 2016
Released 07:00 14-Oct-2016

















RNS Number : 5123M Man Group plc 14 October 2016  


 
 
Press Release 
14 October 2016
 
TRADING STATEMENT for the quarter ended 30 September 2016
 
Key points
 
·     Funds under management (FUM) has increased by 6% during the quarter to $80.7 billion at 30 September 2016 (30 June 2016: $76.4 billion) 
o  Positive investment movement of $2.5 billion in the quarter driven by good performance for GLG and Numeric, partially offset by weaker performance across AHL's strategies 
o  Net inflows in the quarter of $1.3 billion, comprising sales of $6.0 billion and redemptions of $4.7 billion, with net inflows into quant alternative, fund of fund alternative, and quant long only, partially offset by net outflows from discretionary alternatives and long only
o  FX translation effects were flat in the quarter
o  Other positive movements of $0.5 billion with positive investment exposure adjustments of $0.6 billion, partially offset by CLO maturities 
o  Acquisition of Aalto, a real asset focused investment manager with $1.7 billion of funds under management, is due to complete in January 2017 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions
o  Man Global Private Markets business is launched with the acquisition of Aalto, which will provide clients with access to longer term investments
o  Intention to repurchase up to $100 million of shares; we will continue to review further potential acquisition opportunities
o  Surplus regulatory capital of $470 million at 30 September 2016; around $300 million pro-forma including the impact of acquisition and share repurchase
 
Luke Ellis, Chief Executive Officer of Man, said: 
"In a difficult market environment, we are pleased to report a $4.3 billion increase in funds under management in the quarter driven by a positive investment movement of $2.5 billion and net flows of $1.3 billion.  There was good investment performance across both alternative and long only strategies at GLG and Numeric, offsetting negative performance among some of AHL's strategies this quarter, as the market proved more difficult for trend following strategies.  The net inflows were driven largely by the appetite of institutional clients for our quant alternative and quant long only strategies."
 
 
 


 
Acquisition of Aalto and launch of Man Global Private Markets
 
Man announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of Aalto Invest Holding AG and launched Man Global Private Markets, forming the firm's private market offering, which provides clients with access to longer term investments.
 
Full details of the transaction and the launch of the Man Global Private Markets business are provided in a separate announcement released this morning.
 
Share repurchase
 
Man's dividend policy is to pay at least 100% of adjusted management fee earnings per share in each financial year by way of ordinary dividend. In addition, the Group expects to generate significant surplus capital over time, primarily from net performance fee earnings. Available surpluses, after taking into account required capital (including accruals for future earn-out payments), potential strategic opportunities and a prudent buffer, will be distributed to shareholders over time, by way of higher dividend payments and/or share repurchases. Whilst the Board continues to consider dividends as the primary method of returning capital to shareholders, it will continue to execute share repurchases when advantageous. 
 
In line with this policy it is our intention to launch a share repurchase programme for up to $100 million to return surplus capital to shareholders, which will be conducted over the next 12 months.

ALTERNATIVES
Quant
Quant alternative (AHL / Numeric) FUM increased to $19.4 billion during the quarter driven by net inflows, partially offset by negative investment movement. The net inflows of $0.7 billion included $0.4 billion into Dimension, $0.2 billion into Alpha, and $0.2 billion into Institutional Solutions,  partially offset by small net outflows across other strategies. Performance was negative across the majority of AHL strategies during the quarter, with a $0.5 billion reduction in FUM, with Evolution down -1.3%, Alpha down -2.9%, Dimension down -3.2% and Diversified down -5.2% in the quarter. Positive FX movements of $0.1 billion were mainly driven by the US Dollar weakening against the Australian Dollar. Other movements of $0.1 billion were in relation to investment exposure adjustments. As at 30 September 2016, 3% of AHL performance fee eligible open ended FUM was at high watermark and 50% was within 5% of high watermark. The weighted average distance from high watermark for all AHL performance fee eligible FUM was -7.4%.
 
Discretionary 
Discretionary alternatives (GLG) FUM decreased by $0.3 billion during the period with net outflows and CLO maturities, partially offset by positive investment performance. The net outflows of $0.6 billion included $0.4 billion from the equity long short strategy. Negative other movements of $0.1 billion primarily relate to CLO maturities during the quarter.  Investment performance increased FUM by $0.3 billion in the quarter, driven by positive performance for the equity long short strategy (up 4.0% for the quarter) and good performance across the range of strategies. Positive FX movements of $0.1 billion related to the weakening of the US Dollar against the Euro. As at 30 September 2016, 15% of GLG performance fee eligible FUM was at high watermark and 60% was within 5% of high watermark. 
 
 
Fund of funds
Alternative fund of funds (FRM) FUM increased by 8% during the quarter to $12.7 billion. Net inflows of $0.4 billion included $0.8 billion of inflows from managed account mandates, of which $0.7 billion was from a new managed account mandate and $0.1 billion from a previously awarded mandate, partially offset by net outflows of $0.2 billion from segregated portfolios and $0.2 billion from traditional fund of fund strategies. Investment performance across FRM's strategies was flat for the quarter. Positive other movements of $0.5 billion related to investment exposure adjustments.  
 
LONG ONLY
Quant
Quant long only (Numeric / AHL) FUM increased by $2.4 billion during the quarter with net inflows and positive investment movements. Net inflows of $1.0 billion included $1.1 billion into Emerging Market strategies, which are nearing capacity, and $0.1 billion into Global Core, partially offset by $0.2 billion of net outflows across Numeric's other strategies. The positive investment movement of $1.4 billion was primarily due to a combination of investor demand for Emerging and Global equities and Numeric positive performance. The asset weighted outperformance against a blend of applicable benchmarks (net of fees) across Numeric's product range for the quarter to 30 September 2016 was approximately 0.9%2 (underperformance of -1.35%2  for the year to date to 30 September 2016).
 
Discretionary
Discretionary long only (GLG) FUM increased by $0.9 billion to $12.0 billion due to positive investment movement in the quarter, partially offset by net outflows and negative FX movements. Net outflows of $0.2 billion included $0.3 billion from Japan CoreAlpha and $0.2 billion across other strategies, partially offset by $0.3 billion of net inflows for the recently launched Emerging Market Debt strategies.  Positive investment movement increased FUM by $1.3 billion during the quarter, which was mainly due to the performance of Japan CoreAlpha, which was up 14.1% for the quarter (compared to the Topix which was up 7.1%). FX movements of negative $0.2 billion in the quarter were mainly due to the US Dollar strengthening against Sterling. 
 
GUARANTEED PRODUCTS
Guaranteed product funds under management remained flat during the quarter at $0.6 billion. There were no guaranteed product launches and minimal redemptions. There were limited maturities during the quarter, with no significant maturities remaining for the rest of the year.  On 1 October 2016, there was a de-gear of $0.1 billion following the negative performance in September.
         
 
 
2 Numeric's asset weighted alpha for the periods stated is calculated using the asset weighted average of the performance relative to the benchmark for all strategy composites available net of the highest management fees and, as applicable, performance fees that can be charged.

1) Represented by Man AHL Diversified plc from 26 March 1996 to 29 October 2012, and by Man AHL Diversified (Guernsey) USD Shares - Class A from 30 October 2012 to date. The representative product was changed at the end of October 2012 due to legal and/or regulatory restrictions on Man AHL Diversified plc preventing the product from accessing the Programme's revised target allocations. Both funds are valued weekly; however, for comparative purposes, statistics have been calculated using the best quality price that is available at each calendar month end, using estimates where a final price is unavailable.

The representative product was changed at the end of September 2012 due to the provisioning of fund liquidation costs in October 2012 for AHL Alpha plc, which resulted in tracking error compared with other Alpha Programme funds. Both funds are valued weekly; however, for comparative purposes, statistics have been calculated using the best quality price that is available at each calendar month end, using estimates where a final price is unavailable. Where a price, either estimate or final is unavailable on a calendar month end, the price on the closest date prior to the calendar month end has been used.
