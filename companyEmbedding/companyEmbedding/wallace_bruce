Top positive reviewSee all 35 positive reviews› 5.0 out of 5 starsBrave Heart - the True Story!ByJ. Ferrison March 29, 2012If you enjoyed Braveheart then this story gives you the full history & then some.It was written in the 19th century & thus the language is a bit stilted but notwithstanding it is an enjoyable book.The action scenes are well described & entertaining as well as informative.These guys had some serious stones to go up against the English like they did & Henty does a great job of capturing the era!If the language is too difficult for you & you'd like something from a more modern author then try J.R. Tomlin's 2 book series.It's easier to read & although it's been fleshed out with more fictional characters (to make the action a bit better) the history still rings true.

1.0 out of 5 starsNot what I thoughtByMichael J Golembeskyon February 27, 2017This says it's for 8 year olds and up. And one review said it had great pics. There isn't a single picture in the whole book and I don't know a single 8 year old who could read at this level and I work in a school.  My daughter loves history but I don't think she will be able to read this anytime soon. I wanted a book she could read not one I have to read to her. We already have a huge list of books to read together.  We are very disappointed

This has to be one of the best books I have read. I will be reading this to my son when he is old enough to learn what it means to be a man. This book gives such great historical examples of what it means to stand up for what you believe in and defy and overcome tyranny at any cost.

They are formula works that cast an admirable youth into the caldron of historical conflicts. Henty's purpose is to tell morally uplifting tales of perseverance and honor while teaching otherwise accurate history for the audience of young adults.This book is the best I have read both of Henty's work and of Scotland under the Hammer. Think Kipling's book Kim, set in Scotland, where Kim winds up a mighty warrior and then a wealthy lord. Be sure to read Henty's work next to a computer where you can pop up maps of the various unfamiliar locals of the story.This book covers Scotland's resistance to the reign of Edward I of England. From the Scottish perspective Edward I, the greatest of the Plantagenets, the creator of the nation of England, the Hammer of Scotland was not a nice person.The greatness of this Edward is undeniable. He created the empire that came to rule the world. The cruelty of Edward is beyond the imagining of most modern minds. He really did hang Wallace for a while, then take the still living man down and have him disemboweled, then cut into four pieces and sent to the four largest cities in Scotland. Five pieces actually, he kept the head and put it on a pike outside the gate of some castle. A Scottish noble's wife who aided in the crowning of Bruce was then suspended alive in a cage over the gate of another castle...for years. And that was standard treatment for resistance to Edward's plans.Henty covers this history through the life of a young man who serves the fabulous Wallace and the unwilling nationalist hero Bruce. And through it all, as in all Henty's books, the young hero remains good of heart, powerful of arm, and loyal to all he loves. How is that for a refreshing twist in historical fiction?As historical fiction goes...this one is right up there.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsHistorical Adventure at its bestByTexas Consumeron August 20, 2011Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseOld need NOT mean boring.  Think of Henty's style as "Jane Austen meets Kipling."  This book chronicles not only the life and times of William "Braveheart" Wallace, but also Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, as seen through the eyes of a fictional hero.  Well researched, the history buff will also enjoy this novel of derring-do.  Of course, Henty wrote in the convention of his day, but this only makes the book more quaint.  His love interest is present, but gentlemanly written, much as Sir Walter Scott handled the lovers in "Ivanhoe."  It is slow going at first, but once the main character (Sir Archibald Forbes)is introduced, the book comes alive.  I suggest one google a map of Scotland to see exactly WHERE all this takes place, as the book well and truly covers a lot of years and territory.  ENJOY.0Comment|

Possibly, and a bargain at twice the price (yes, I know it is free)ByAmazon Customeron March 17, 2015Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseAmazing, actually. I have read several of Henty's books and found them to be formulaic but still entertaining. This book was very different, not only interesting and entertaining but very educational as well. I heartily recommend this to anyone.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Webbon May 11, 2012Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI am a great fan of historical fiction. While the background is not fiction, it has the benefit of reading with the ease of a novel as it follows the adventures of the fictitious Sir Archie Forbes as he teams with the real William Wallace. For those with an interest in these rather formative years of Scottish history, this is well worth the read.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

            My wife, 2 oldest children (10 & 8), and I really enjoyed this audio drama.  Our two youngest children (6 & 4) were too young to follow along.  We stopped at multiple points while listening to talk through things happening in the story.  Our 8 year old boy is sensitive and asked us at various points to stop it because he didn't like to hear the fighting, however we asked him to continue with us as we listened through it so that he could be part of the important topics and even better understand the pains and sacrifice of war.  By the end of the story our 8 year-old said he was glad to have listened to it with us.


I believe that 9/10 years old and older is probably the best ages for this story.


The story was occasionally hard to follow due to the poor quality of our vehicle's speakers.  However, we were able to track with the important parts of the story and re-listen to particular lines that we felt were too important to miss.  A thought provoking story that provoked much discussion.

            I teach junior high literature, and my students are required to read In Freedom's Cause by G.A. Henty.  This high quality audio production is the perfect complement to reading the Henty text.  The audio exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it.  I will definitely purchase more audio productions from Heirloom Audio.

            The audio was well done and the presentation was excellent.


 I enjoyed it so much, I purchase several copies for my grandchildren.


Thanks for putting quality and historical accuracy first!

In Freedom’s Cause: A Story of Wallace and Bruce (G. A. Henty) Author: G. A. Henty $23.95 $18.50

Liberty or death – this was the choice the people of 14th century Scotland faced if they rose up against their English ruler. Most would say it was no choice at all. Many of the Scottish nobles were English supporters. Few could be expected to rise up against the numerically overwhelming English army.
The hero of the story, Archibald Forbes, joins the struggle for Scottish freedom led by the valiant Sir William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of these men rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry. Henty weaves a wonderful story around the actual events of 1314 at Bannockburn.

Publisher's Description▼▲
This book seeks to inspire you, lift up your faith and give you hope and confidence in the future. It teaches you not to accept the disadvantageous circumstances of your birth, the place where you started life or other limitations as a fait accompli, but rather to learn to become strategically positioned to have a deastiny-encounter that could totally transform your life and lead you to a life of victory and celebration.

Description


Additional information


Reviews (0)





Setting: AD 1300’s – Scotland and England – William Wallace and Robert the Bruce.
Story: Liberty or death – this was the choice the people of 14th century Scotland faced if they rose up against their English ruler. Most would say it was no choice at all. Many of the Scottish nobles were English supporters. Few could be expected to rise up against the numerically overwhelming English army. The hero of the story, Archibald Forbes, joins the struggle for Scottish freedom led by the valiant Sir William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of these men rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry. Henty weaves a wonderful story around the actual events of 1314 at Bannockburn.
