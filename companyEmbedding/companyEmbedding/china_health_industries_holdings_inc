	CHINA HEALTH INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES





	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	Note 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND



	China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. (China Health US) was
	incorporated in the State of Arizona on July 11, 1996 and was the successor of
	the business known as Arizona Mist, Inc. which began in 1989. On May 9, 2005, it
	entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement and Share Exchange (effecting a reverse
	merger) with Edmonds 6, Inc. (Edmonds 6), a Delaware corporation, and changed
	its name to Universal Fog, Inc. Pursuant to this agreement, Universal Fog, Inc.
	(which has been in continuous operation since 1996) became a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of Edmonds 6.


	China Health Industries Holdings Limited (China Health HK)
	was incorporated on July 20, 2007 in Hong Kong under the Companies Ordinance as
	a limited liability company. China Health HK was formed for the purpose of
	seeking and consummating a merger or acquisition with a business entity
	organized as a private corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship as
	defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ACS Topic 915
	(Development Stage Entities).


	Harbin Humankind Biology Technology Co., Limited (Humankind)
	was incorporated in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, the Peoples Republic of
	China (the PRC) on December 14, 2003, as a limited liability company under the
	Company Law of the PRC. Humankind is engaged in the manufacturing and sale of
	health products.


	On August 20, 2007, the sole shareholder of China Health HK
	entered into a share purchase agreement (the Share Purchase Agreement) with
	the owners of Humankind. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, China Health
	HK purchased 100% of the ownership in Humankind for a cash consideration of
	$60,408 (the Share Purchase). Subsequent to the completion of the Share
	Purchase, Humankind became a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Health HK. The
	Share Purchase was accounted for as a reverse merger since the owner of
	Humankind owned a majority of the outstanding shares of China Health HKs common
	stock immediately following the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, it
	was deemed to be the acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets
	and liabilities and the historical operations that have been reflected in the
	financial statements for periods prior to the Share Purchase are those of
	Humankind and have been recorded at the historical cost basis. After completion
	of the Share Purchase, China Health HKs consolidated financial statements
	include the assets and liabilities of both China Health HK and Humankind, the
	historical operations of Humankind, and the operations of China Health HK and
	its subsidiaries from the closing date of the Share Purchase.

	On October 14, 2008, Humankind set up a 99% owned subsidiary,
	Harbin Huimeijia Medicine Company (Huimeijia), with its primary business being
	manufacturing and distributing medicine. Mr. Xin Sun, the Companys majority
	owner, owns 1% of Huimeijia. Huimeijia is consolidated in the consolidated
	financial statements of China Health HK.


	On December 31, 2008, China Health HK entered into a reverse
	merger with Universal Fog, Inc., a U.S. publicly traded shell company (the
	Transaction). China Health HK is the acquirer in the Transaction, and the
	Transaction has been treated as a recapitalization of China Health US. After the
	Transaction and a 20:1 reverse stock split, Mr. Xin Sun owned 61,203,088 shares
	of common stock, representing 98.3% of the 62,234,737 total outstanding shares
	of common stock of China Health US. On April 7, 2009, Mr. Sun transferred
	28,200,000 shares of common stock to 296 individuals, leaving him with
	33,003,088 shares of common stock of China Health US, or approximately 53.03% of
	the total outstanding shares of common stock. Universal Fog, Inc. changed its
	name to China Health Industries Holdings, Inc. on February 19, 2009.


	On November 22, 2013, Humankind completed the acquisition of
	Heilongjiang Huimeijia Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (HLJ Huimeijia) for a total
	purchase price of $16,339,869 (RMB100,000,000). HLJ Huimeijia was founded on
	October 30, 2003, and is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of
	tincture, ointments, rubber paste (including hormones), topical solution,
	suppositories, liniment (including traditional Chinese medicine extractions),
	enemas and oral liquids. HLJ Huimeijias predecessor is Heilongjiang Xue Du
	Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which has established its brand name in the market
	through its supply of high quality medical products. HLJ Huimeijia is
	categorized as a high and new technology enterprise by the Science Technology
	Department in Heilongjiang Province. HLJ Huimeijia has 21 products which have
	been approved by, and have received approval numbers issued by, the China State
	Food and Drug Administration (the CFDA). In addition, HLJ Huimeijia is the
	holder of one patent for utility models, five patents for external design and
	three trademarks in China, including the Chinese brand name of Xue Du which
	has an established reputation among customers in northeastern China.

	On December 24, 2014, Humankind entered into a Stock Transfer
	Agreement (the Original Agreement) with Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group Co.,
	Ltd. a company incorporated under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China and
	located in Jilin province (Xiuzheng Pharmacy or the Buyer), Mr. Xin Sun, the
	CEO of the Company, and Huimeijia, a 99% owned subsidiary of Humankind and 1%
	owned by Mr. Xin Sun, pursuant to which, Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun (the Equity
	Holders), shall sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia, to
	Xiuzheng Pharmacy. On February 9, 2015, the four parties entered into a
	supplementary agreement (the Supplementary Agreement) to modify the terms of
	the Original Agreement, pursuant to which, the Equity Holders and Huimeijia
	(collectively the Assets Transferors) shall only sell the 19 drug approval
	numbers (the Assets) to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The Equity Holders will retain the
	equity interests in Huimeijia, but will have the equity interests pledged to Xiuzheng Pharmacy until the Assets are transferred. On
	October 12, 2016, the four parties agreed to rescind the Supplementary Agreement
	and entered into a new supplementary agreement, pursuant to which, the four
	parties agreed to execute the transfer of the equity interests based on the
	Original Agreement, and according to which the Equity Holders shall sell their
	respective equity interests in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy for a total cash
	consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately $1,306,186, the Purchase Price)
	to the Equity Holders. As of the date of this report, 40% of the Purchase Price
	was paid and the Company has completed the changes in business registration and
	Xiuzheng Pharmacy obtained the newly issued document evidencing its ownership on
	Huimeijia, which is the business license issued by the local State
	Administration of Industry and Commerce in Harbin (Harbin SAIC) to Huimeijia
	where the ownership of Huimeijia has now been recorded as held by Xiuzheng
	Pharmacy with Harbin SAIC, and the legal representative (a person that is
	authorized to take most of the corporate actions on behalf of a company under
	the corporate laws in China) of Huimeijia has now become a person designated by
	the Buyer. The transfer of all the drugs to the Buyer and the remainder of the
	Purchase Price are pending to be processed (See Note 3). As of September 30,
	2016, the results of operations of Huimeijia business are reflected in the
	Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued
	operations.


	China Health US, China Health HK, Humankind, Huimeijia and HLJ
	Huimeijia are collectively referred herein to as the Company.


	As of September 30, 2016, the Companys corporate structure was
	as follows:

	Note 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Basis of Presentation



	This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company
	is presented to assist in understanding the Companys financial statements. The
	financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management,
	which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting
	policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United
	States ("US GAAP") and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.


	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared by Company without audit pursuant to the rules and
	regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain
	information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
	in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted as allowed by such
	rules and regulations, and management believes that the disclosures are adequate
	to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited condensed
	consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
	financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report
	on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. These unaudited condensed
	consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which in the opinion
	of management are necessary to a fair presentation of financial position and
	results of operations. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring
	nature. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016
	may not be indicative of results that may be expected for the year ended June
	30, 2017.



	Principles of Consolidation



	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements include China Health US and its four subsidiary companies, including
	China Health HK, Humankind, Huimeijia, and HLJ Huimeijia. All significant
	intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation and
	combination.


	On November 22, 2013, China Health US, through its wholly owned
	subsidiary Humankind, completed the acquisition of HLJ Huimeijia. HLJ Huimeijia
	and Humankind are under the common control of Mr. Xin Sun, the CEO of the
	Company before and after the date of transfer. Humankinds accounting policy
	adopted the guidance in ASC 805-50-05-5 for the transfer of net assets between
	entities under common control to apply a method similar to the
	pooling-of-interests method. Under this method, the financial statements of
	Humankind shall report results of operations for the period in which the
	transfer occurs as though the transfer of net assets had occurred at the
	beginning of the period. Results of operations for that period will thus
	comprise both those of the previously separate entities combined from the
	beginning of the period to the date the transfer is completed and those of the
	combined operations from that date to the end of the period.
	Similarly, Humankind shall present the statements of financial position and
	other financial information as of the beginning of the period as though the
	assets and liabilities had been transferred at that date. Financial statements
	and financial information of Humankind presented for prior years also shall be
	retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information.


	11








	Reclassifications



	Certain prior year balances were reclassified to conform to the
	current period's presentation with consideration of reflecting Huimeijia
	business as discontinued operations. None of these reclassifications had an
	impact on reported financial position or cash flows for any of the periods
	presented.



	Segment Reporting



	FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, established standards
	for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with
	the Company's internal organizational structure as well as information about
	geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial
	statements for details on the Company's business segments. The Company has three
	reportable operating segments: Humankind, HLJ Huimeijia and others. The segments
	are grouped based on the types of products provided.



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The provisions of accounting guidance, FASB ASC Topic 820 that
	applies to the Company requires all entities to disclose the fair value of
	financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized
	on the balance sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and
	defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the
	instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
	parties.



	Fair Value Measurements



	FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
	clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a
	framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the
	use of fair value measurements.


	Various inputs are considered when determining the fair value
	of the Companys debt. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities
	are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these
	securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.


	12







	Level 1 observable market inputs that
	are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
	markets.


	Level 2 other significant observable
	inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit
	risk, etc.).


	Level 3 significant unobservable
	inputs (including the Companys own assumptions in determining the fair value of
	investments).


	The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded
	at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets
	and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to
	fair value when a significant event occurs. The Company had no financial assets
	or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting
	periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are
	those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is
	prepared. The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and
	measured on a recurring basis during the reporting periods.


	The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from
	instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type
	of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other
	characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments,
	pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology
	used is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not
	require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments,
	pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management
	judgment.



	Translation of Foreign Currencies



	Humankind, Huimeijia and HLJ Huimeijia maintain their books and
	accounting records in PRC currency Renminbi (RMB), which has been determined
	as the functional currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other than
	RMB are translated into RMB at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the
	transactions, as quoted by the Federal Reserve Board. Foreign currency exchange
	gains and losses resulting from these transactions are included in operations.


	Humankind, Huimeijia and HLJ Huimeijias financial statements
	are translated into the reporting currency, the United States Dollar (USD).
	Assets and liabilities of the above entities are translated at the prevailing
	exchange rate at each reporting period end date. Contributed capital accounts
	are translated using the historical rate of exchange when capital is injected.
	Income and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange
	during the reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from the
	translation of these financial statements are reflected as accumulated other
	comprehensive income in shareholders equity and non-controlling interests.


	13








	Statement of Cash Flows



	In accordance with Statement FASB ASC Topic 230, Statement of
	Cash Flows, cash flow from the Company's operations is calculated based upon
	the local currencies and translated to the reporting currency using an average
	foreign exchange rate for the reporting period. As a result, amounts related to
	assets and liabilities reported in the statement of cash flows will not
	necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance
	sheet.



	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
	GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its
	estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other
	assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the
	circumstances. Estimates and assumptions of future events and their effects
	cannot be perceived with certainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change
	as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information
	is obtained and as the Companys operating environment changes. Significant
	estimates and assumptions by management include, among others; useful lives of
	long-lived assets and intangible assets, valuation of inventory, accounts
	receivable and notes receivable, impairment analysis of long-lived assets,
	construction in progress, intangible assets and deferred taxes. While the
	Company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of
	the financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those
	estimates. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects
	of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period they are
	determined to be necessary.



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits in
	banks with maturities of three months or less, and all highly liquid investments
	which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, and which have original
	maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.


	As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Companys
	uninsured bank balance was mainly maintained at financial institutions located
	in the PRC and HK. The uninsured bank balances of continuing operations were
	$20,778,742 and $29,783,152 as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
	respectively. The uninsured bank balances of discontinued operations were $8,549
	and $8,578 as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The Company
	has no insured bank balance as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
	respectively.


	14








	Accounts Receivable



	Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do
	not bear interest. The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the
	ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing
	credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful
	accounts is established and determined based on managements assessment of known
	requirements, aging of receivables, payment and bad debt history, the customers
	current credit worthiness, changes in customer payment patterns and the economic
	environment. From November 1, 2013, the Company changed its credit policy by
	offering ninety (90) day payment terms for sales agents, whereas the payment
	terms for sales agents before November 1, 2013 were thirty (30) day. As of
	September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the balances of accounts receivable from
	the continuing operations, were $962,055 and $1,145,131, respectively. As of
	September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the balances of accounts receivable from
	discontinued operations, were both nil. The Company determines the allowance
	based on aging data, historical collection experience, customer specific facts
	and economic conditions. Account balances are charged off against the allowance
	after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery
	is considered remote. The Company evaluated the nature of all accounts
	receivable then provided allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company has
	determined that an allowance of $50,710 and $52,129 from the continuing
	operations was appropriate as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,
	respectively. The Company has determined that an allowance of nil from
	discontinued operations was appropriate as of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
	2016.



	Advance to Suppliers



	The Company periodically makes advances to certain vendors for
	purchases of raw materials, or service providers for services relating to
	construction plans for its plant, equipment and production lines for the GMP
	upgrading, and records these payments as advance to suppliers. As of September
	30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, advance to suppliers, held for continuing
	operations, amounted to $153,816 and $154,430, respectively. As of September 30,
	2016 and June 30, 2016, advance to suppliers, held for discontinued operations,
	amounted to $556 and $558, respectively.



	Inventory



	Inventory consists of raw materials, work in progress and
	finished goods of manufactured products.


	Inventory is stated at lower of cost or market and consists of
	materials, labor and overhead. HLJ Huimeijia uses the weighted average method
	for inventory valuation. The other entities of the Company use the first-in,
	first-out (FIFO) method for inventory valuation. Overhead costs included in
	finished goods include direct labor cost and other costs directly applicable to
	the manufacturing process. The Company evaluates inventory for excess, slow
	moving, and obsolete inventory as well as inventory the value of which is in
	excess of its net realizable value. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and
	projections of future demand. If future demand or market conditions are less
	favorable than the Companys projections, a write-down of inventory may be
	required, and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the
	revision is made. There was no inventory allowance, held for continuing
	operations and discontinued operations, provided for the three months ended
	September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	15








	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	The Companys long-lived assets and other assets are reviewed
	for impairment in accordance with the guidance of the FASB ASC Topic 360-10,
	Property, Plant, and Equipment, and FASB ASC Topic 205, Presentation of
	Financial Statements. The Company tests for impairment losses on long-lived
	assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
	that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
	an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
	of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by
	the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
	recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
	exceeds its fair value. Impairment evaluations involve managements estimates on
	asset useful lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows
	could be different from those estimated by management which could have a
	material effect on the Companys reporting results and financial position. Fair
	value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted
	cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals,
	as considered necessary. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company
	had not experienced impairment losses on its long-lived assets for both the
	continuing and discontinued operations. However, there can be no assurances that
	demand for the Companys products or services will continue, which could result
	in an impairment of long-lived assets in the future.



	Property, Plant and Equipment



	Property, plant and equipment are carried at the lower of cost
	or fair value. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred,
	major renewals and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity
	of plant assets are capitalized.


	When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and
	accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains
	or losses are included in the results of operations in the reporting period of
	disposition.


	Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
	estimated useful life of the assets. The depreciable lives applied are:

	Intangible Assets



	The Company evaluates intangible assets in accordance with FASB
	ASC Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other. Intangible assets deemed to
	have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment
	tests. If the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are
	not correct, or if business conditions change, purchase price adjustments or
	future asset impairment charges could be required. The value of the Companys
	intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any
	future declines in the Companys operating results, (ii) a decline in the
	valuation of technology, including the valuation of the Companys common stock,
	(iii) a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy, or (iv) any failure to
	meet the performance projections included in the Companys forecasts of future
	operating results. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, the Company tests
	intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the
	Company believes indicators of impairment exist. Impairment evaluations involve
	management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows. Significant
	management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results
	that are used in the evaluations. It is possible, however, that the plans and
	estimates used may be incorrect. If the Companys actual results, or the plans
	and estimates used in future impairment analysis, are lower than the original
	estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur
	additional impairment charges in a future period. Based on such evaluations,
	there was no impairment recorded for intangible assets, held for both the
	continuing and discontinued operations, for the three months ended September 30,
	2016 and 2015, respectively.



	Construction in Progress



	Construction in progress represents the costs incurred in
	connection with the construction of buildings or new additions to the Companys
	plant facilities. Costs classified as construction in progress include all costs
	of obtaining the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary
	for its intended use. No depreciation is provided for construction in progress
	until such time as the assets are completed and are placed into service.


	The Company reviews the carrying value of construction in
	progress for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the
	carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash
	flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where
	undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the
	assets, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the
	carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. The factors considered by
	management in performing this assessment include current operating results,
	trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic
	factors. Based on this assessment, there was no impairment recorded for
	construction in progress, held for both the continuing and discontinued
	operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively.

	Revenue Recognition



	The Company recognizes revenue when it is both earned and
	realized or realizable. The Companys policy is to recognize revenue when title
	to the product, ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the customer,
	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits and collection of the sales proceeds
	is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur upon shipment of goods to
	customers. The majority of the Companys revenue relates to the sale of
	inventory to customers, and revenue is recognized when title and the risks and
	rewards of ownership pass to the customer. Given the nature of the Companys
	business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition, the Companys
	revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect
	the results of operations. The Company records revenue at the discounted selling
	price and allows its customers to return products for exchange or credit subject
	to certain limitations. A provision for such returns is recorded based upon
	historical experience. There has been no provision recorded for returns based
	upon historical experience, held for both the continuing and discontinued
	operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively.

	Cost of Goods Sold



	Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of raw
	materials, freight charges, direct labor, depreciation of plants and machinery,
	warehousing and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing process and
	commission expenses.



	Income Taxes



	The Company adopts FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which
	requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
	future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
	statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
	recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the
	tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at
	each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to
	the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
	assets to the amount expected to be realized.


	In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48(ASC 740-10), Accounting
	for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
	(ASC 740), which requires income tax positions to meet a more-likely-than-not
	recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN
	48(ASC 740-10), tax positions that previously failed to meet the
	more-likely-than-not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent
	financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized
	tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold should be
	derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that
	threshold is no longer met.


	As a result of the implementation of FIN 48 (ASC 740-10), the
	Company undertook a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax positions in
	accordance with recognition standards established by FIN 48 (ASC 740-10). The
	Company recognized no material adjustments to liabilities or stockholders
	equity as a result of the implementation. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a
	material impact on the Companys financial statements.


	The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal
	and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations
	themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy,
	changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings.
	Therefore, the actual liability may be materially different from the Companys
	estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities
	or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset
	valuation allowance.

	Enterprise Income Tax



	Under the Provisional Regulations of PRC Concerning Income Tax
	on Enterprises promulgated by the PRC (the EIT Law), income tax is payable by
	enterprises at a rate of 25% of their taxable income.



	Value Added Tax



	The Provisional Regulations of PRC Concerning Value Added Tax
	promulgated by the State Council came into effect on January 1, 1994. Under
	these regulations and the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations of
	the PRC Concerning Value Added Tax, value added tax (VAT) is imposed on goods
	sold in, or imported into, the PRC and on processing, repair and replacement
	services provided within the PRC.


	VAT payable in the PRC is charged on an aggregated basis at a
	rate of 13% or 17% (depending on the type of goods involved) on the full price
	collected for the goods sold or, in the case of taxable services provided, at a
	rate of 17% on the charges for the taxable services provided, but excluding, in
	respect of both goods and services, any amount paid in respect of VAT included
	in the price or charges, and less any deductible VAT already paid by the
	taxpayer on purchases of goods and services in the same financial year. As of
	September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 VAT payables from the continuing operations
	were $197,378 and $183,813, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and June 30,
	2016, VAT payables were both nil for the discontinued operations.



	Sales-Related Taxes



	Pursuant to the tax law and regulations of the PRC, the Company
	is obligated to pay 7% and 5% of the annual VAT paid as taxes on maintaining and
	building cities and education additional fees, both of which belong to
	sales-related taxes. Sales-related taxes are recorded when sales revenue is
	recognized. Sales-related taxes from the continuing operations were $22,637 and
	$33,901 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
	Sales-related taxes from the discontinued operations were both nil for the three
	months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.



	Concentrations of Business and Credit Risks



	All of the Companys manufacturing is located in the PRC. There
	can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully continue to
	manufacture its products and failure to do so would have a material adverse
	effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash
	flows. Also, the success of the Companys operations is subject to numerous
	contingencies, some of which are beyond managements control. These
	contingencies include general economic conditions, prices of raw materials,
	competition, governmental and political conditions, and changes in regulations. Since the Company is dependent on trade
	in the PRC, the Company is subject to various additional political, economic and
	other uncertainties. Among other risks, the Companys operations will be subject
	to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds, domestic customs, changing
	taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, and political and governmental
	regulations.


	20







	The Company operates in China, which may give rise to
	significant foreign currency risks from fluctuations and the degree of
	volatility of foreign exchange rates between U.S. dollars and the Chinese
	currency RMB. The results of operations denominated in foreign currency are
	translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting periods.



	Earnings Per Share



	Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net
	earnings applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
	common shares outstanding during the period. When applicable, diluted earnings
	per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common
	shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common
	stock equivalents, consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of
	common stock options and warrants. For the three months ended September 30, 2016
	and 2015, the Company had no potential dilutive common stock equivalents
	outstanding.


	Potential common shares issued are calculated using the
	treasury stock method, which recognizes the use of proceeds that could be
	obtained upon the exercise of options and warrants in computing diluted earnings
	per share. It assumes that any proceeds would be used to purchase common stock
	at the average market price of the common stock during the period.


	FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, requires a
	reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted
	earnings per share (EPS) computations.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	In August 2016, the FASB has issued Accounting Standards Update
	(ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of
	Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain
	cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
	cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash
	flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of
	Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest
	Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the
	Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business
	Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds
	from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies,
	including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received
	from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization
	Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the
	Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective for public business
	entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
	within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted,
	including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied using
	a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is
	impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues,
	the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the
	earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
	this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related
	disclosures.


	21







	In October 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income
	Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The
	amendments require an entity to recognize income tax consequences of an
	intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs
	and remove the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold
	to an outside party. The amendments are effective for public business entities
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. For all other
	entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The
	Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its
	consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.


	In October 2016, the FASB has issued ASU No. 2016-17,
	Consolidation (Topic 810): Interest Held through Related Parties That Are under
	Common Control, to provide guidance on the evaluation of whether a reporting
	entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by amending how a reporting entity,
	that is a single decision maker of a VIE, treats indirect interests in that
	entity held through related parties that are under common control. The
	amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
	For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim
	period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on
	its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.





	NOTE 3 - ASSETS SALE



	On December 24, 2014, Humankind entered into a stock transfer
	agreement (the Original Agreement) with Xiuzheng Pharmaceutical Group Co.,
	Ltd. a company incorporated under the laws of the Peoples Republic of China and
	located in Jilin province (Xiuzheng Pharmacyor the Buyer), Mr. Xin Sun, the
	CEO of the Company, and Huimeijia, pursuant to which, Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun (the
	Equity Holders), shall sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to
	Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The transfer of the 100% equity interests of Huimeijia to the
	Buyer was for a total cash consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately
	$1,306,186) to the Equity Holders.


	22







	On February 9, 2015, the four parties entered into a
	supplementary agreement (the Supplementary Agreement) to modify the terms of
	the Original Agreement, pursuant to which, the Equity Holders and Huimeijia
	(collectively the Assets Transferors) shall only sell the 19 drug approval
	numbers (including the tablet, capsule, powder, mixture, oral liquid, syrup and
	oral solution under the 19 approval numbers; licenses including the original
	copies of Business License, Organization Code Certificate, Tax Registration
	Certificate, Drug Production Permit and GMP Certificate, and other documents and
	original copies related to the production and operation of the 19 drugs) (the
	Assets) to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The Equity Holders will retain the equity
	interests in Huimeijia, but will have the equity interests pledged to Xiuzheng
	Pharmacy until the Assets are transferred, at which time all the cash
	consideration shall be paid by the Buyer. The total cash consideration remains
	to be the same as under the Original Agreement, i.e., RMB 8,000,000
	(approximately $1,306,186) to the Assets Transferors. In the event that the
	Assets are failed to be transferred to the Buyer due to the fault of the Assets
	Transferors, the paid consideration shall be returned to the Buyer with
	interests accrued. If the failure of the transfer of the Assets is a result of
	the government policy changes or force majeure, the paid cash consideration
	shall be returned to the Buyer but without any interests.


	On October 12, 2016, the four parties agreed to rescind the
	Supplementary Agreement and entered into a new supplementary agreement (the
	Agreement), pursuant to which, the four parties agreed to execute the transfer
	of the equity interests based on the Original Agreement, and according to which
	the Equity Holders shall sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to
	Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The transfer of the 100% equity interests of Huimeijia to the
	Buyer was for a total cash consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately
	$1,306,186) (the Purchase Price) to the Equity Holders. 40% of the Purchase
	Price is due within 10 business days after signing the Agreement; 40% of the
	Purchase Price is due within 10 business days after the completion of the
	changes in business registration and Xiuzheng Pharmacy obtains the newly issued
	documents evidencing its ownership on Huimeijia; 15% of the Purchase Price is
	due within 10 business days after the transfer of all the drugs is approved by
	Heilongjiang FDA; and 5% of the Purchase Price is due within 10 business days
	after all the drugs have been transferred to Xiuzheng Pharmacy or its designated
	entity and Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun instructs Xiuzheng Pharmacy to complete
	three-batches production of all forms of drugs. As of the date of this report,
	40% of the Purchase Price was paid and the Company has completed the changes in
	business registration and Xiuzheng Pharmacy obtained the newly issued documents
	evidencing its ownership on Huimeijia, which are evidenced by the business
	license issued by the local State Administration of Industry and Commerce in
	Harbin (Harbin SAIC) to Huimeijia where the ownership of Huimeijia has now
	been recorded as held by Xiuzheng Pharmacy with Harbin SAIC and the legal
	representative (a person that is authorized to take most of the corporate
	actions on behalf of a company under the corporate laws in China) of Huimeijia has now
	become a person designated by the Buyer. The transfer of all the drugs to the
	Buyer and the remainder of the Purchase Price are pending to be processed.

	exchanged in the market. The successor owner of the land use right will have the
	right to use the land for the time remaining on the initial period.


	Amortization expense from the continuing operations was
	$111,390 and $147,450 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,

	NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES




	(a) Corporate income taxes




	United States



	China Health US was organized in the United States. China
	Health US had no taxable income for US income tax purposes for the three months
	ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, China
	Health US has a net operating loss carry forward for United States income taxes.
	Net operating loss carry forwards are available to reduce future years taxable
	income. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these
	losses appears uncertain due to the Companys operating history and the
	continued losses of the US entity. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100%
	valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset to reduce the asset to zero. There
	were no changes in the valuation allowance for the three months ended September
	30, 2016 and 2015. Management reviews this valuation allowance periodically and
	makes adjustments accordingly.


	27








	Hong Kong



	China Health HK was incorporated in Hong Kong and is subject to
	Hong Kong taxation on its activities conducted in Hong Kong and income arising
	in or derived from Hong Kong. No provision for income taxes have been made as
	China Health HK has no taxable income in Hong Kong.





	Peoples Republic of China



	Under the EIT Law, the standard EIT rate is 25%. The PRC
	subsidiaries of the Company are subject to PRC income taxes on an entity basis
	on income arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction in which they
	operate.


	The provision for income taxes from the continuing operations
	consisted of the following for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
	2015:

	As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company accrued
	a 100% valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets based on the assessment on
	the probability of future reversion.


	28








	(b) Uncertain tax positions



	There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30,
	2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Management does not anticipate any
	potential future adjustments in the next twelve months which would result in a
	material change to its tax positions. For the three months ended September 30,
	2016 and 2015, the Company did not incur any interest and penalties arising from
	its tax payments.



	NOTE 12 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	The Companys assets are located in the PRC and revenues are
	derived from operations in the PRC.


	In terms of industry regulations and policies, the economy of
	the PRC has been transitioning from a planned economy to market oriented
	economy. Although in recent years the Chinese government has implemented
	measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reforms, the
	reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound
	corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of
	productive assets in the PRC is still owned by the Chinese government. For
	example, all land is state owned and leased to business entities or individuals
	through the governments granting of Land Use Rights. The granting process is
	typically based on government policies at the time of granting and can be
	lengthy and complex. This process may adversely affect the Companys future
	manufacturing expansions. The Chinese government also exercises significant
	control over the PRCs economic growth through the allocation of resources and
	providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.
	Uncertainties may arise with changing of governmental policies and measures.


	The Company faces a number of risks and challenges not
	typically associated with companies in North America or Western Europe, since
	its assets exist solely in the PRC, and its revenues are derived from its
	operations therein. The PRC is a developing country with an early stage market
	economic system, overshadowed by the state. Its political and economic systems
	are very different from the more developed countries and are in a state of
	change. The PRC also faces many social, economic and political challenges that
	may produce major shocks, instabilities and even crises, in both its domestic
	arena and in its relationships with other countries, including the United
	States. Such shocks, instabilities and crises may in turn significantly and
	negatively affect the Companys performance.


	Since the Company terminated its rental agreement on January 9,
	2013, it had no rental commitment as of September 30, 2016.


	29








	NOTE 13 - MAJOR SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS



	For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
	two suppliers that in the aggregate accounted for 88% of the Companys purchases
	for the continuing operations, with each supplier accounting for 78% and 10%,
	respectively.


	For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had
	one supplier that in the aggregate accounted for 75% of the Companys purchases
	for the continuing operations.


	For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
	six customers that in the aggregate accounted for 81% of the Companys total
	sales for the continuing operations, with each customer accounting for 16%, 15%,
	13%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively.


	For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had
	four customers that in the aggregate accounted for 42% of the Companys total
	sales for the continuing operations, with each customer accounting for 11%, 11%,
	10% and 10%, respectively.



	NOTE 14 - SEGMENT REPORTING



	The Company was organized into three main business segments
	based on the types of products being provided to customers: HLJ Huimeijia,
	Humankind and others. Each of the three operating segments referenced above has
	separate and distinct general ledgers. The chief operating decision maker
	(CODM) receives financial information, including revenue, gross margin,
	operating income, and net income produced from the various general ledger
	systems to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance;
	however, the principal measure of segment profitability or loss used by the CODM
	is net loss by segment. The discontinued Huimeijia business was included in
	others segment.


	The following tables present summary information by segment for
	the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

	Managements Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations.






	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	We make certain forward-looking statements in this report.
	Statements concerning our future operations, prospects, strategies, financial
	condition, future economic performance (including growth and earnings), demand
	for our services, and other statements of our plans, beliefs, or expectations,
	including the statements contained under this caption as well as captions
	elsewhere in this document, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, these
	statements are identifiable through the use of words such as anticipate,
	believe, estimate, expect, intend, plan, project, target, can,
	could, may, should, will, would, and similar expressions. The
	forward-looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and
	are subject to various assumptions, risks, and other factors that could cause
	actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these
	forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, together with the
	other risks described from time to time in reports and documents that we file
	with the SEC should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements.
	Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results
	may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
	statements. Indeed, it is likely that some of our assumptions will prove to be
	incorrect. Our actual results and financial position will vary from those
	projected or implied in the forward-looking statements and the variances may be
	material. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
	statements, which reflect our view only as of the date of this report.


	Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
	from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the
	following:




	 


	


	the effect of political, economic, and market
	conditions and geopolitical events;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	


	legislative and regulatory changes that affect
	our business;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	


	the availability of funds and working capital;
	and




	 


	 


	 




	 


	


	the actions and initiatives of current and
	potential competitors.




	Except as required by applicable laws, regulations or rules, we
	do not undertake any responsibility to publicly release any revisions to these
	forward-looking statements to take into account events or circumstances that
	occur after the date of this report. Additionally, we do not undertake any
	responsibility to update you on the occurrence of any unanticipated events which
	may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by any
	forward-looking statements.


	36







	The following discussion and analysis should be read in
	conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
	the related notes thereto as filed with the SEC and other financial information
	contained elsewhere in this report.


	Except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in
	this report to we, us, our, the Registrant, our Company, or the

	Biology Technology Co. Limited (Humankind) and indirect 99% owned subsidiary,
	Harbin Huimeijia Medicine Company (Huimeijia) and indirect wholly owned
	subsidiary, Heilongjiang Huimeijia Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (HLJ Huimeijia).
	Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to (i) PRC and China
	are to the Peoples Republic of China; (ii) U.S. dollar, $ and US$ are to
	United States dollars; (iii) RMB are to Renminbi Yuan of China; (iv)
	Securities Act are to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and (v)
	Exchange Act are to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



	Business Overview



	Our principal business operations are conducted through our
	wholly-owned subsidiaries, Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia.


	The Company owns a GMP-certified plant and facilities and has
	the capacity to produce 21 CFDA-approved medicines and 14 CFDA-approved health
	supplement products in soft capsule, hard capsule, tablet, granule and oral
	liquid forms. These products address the needs of some key sectors in China,
	including the feminine, geriatric and childrens markets.


	HLJ Huimeijia's current certificate of GMP expired by the end
	of December 2015. HLJ Huimeijia has applied a new certificate of GMP, which is
	expected to be obtained in April 2017. However, there is no assurance that we
	will obtain the new GMP certificate by such time. According to the law of PRC,
	HLJ Huimeijia must cease all production activities before getting the new GMP
	certificate. The equipment and production line is being reconstructed from the
	third quarter of the fiscal year 2016 to the third quarter of the fiscal year
	2017 for the purpose of applying for the new GMP certificate. Although HLJ
	Huimeijia could sell inventory produced before obtaining the new GMP
	certificate, management anticipates there will be no or very little revenue
	generated by HLJ Huimeijia after the expiration of the old GMP certificate.


	On December 24, 2014, Humankind, Xiuzheng Pharmacy (the
	Buyer), Mr. Xin Sun and Huimeijia entered into a Stock Transfer Agreement (the
	Original Agreement), pursuant to which, Humankind and Mr. Xin Sun (the Equity Holders) shall sell their respective equity interests
	in Huimeijia to Xiuzheng Pharmacy. On February 9, 2015, the four parties entered
	into a Supplementary Agreement (the Supplementary Agreement) to modify the
	terms of the Original Agreement, pursuant to which, the Equity Holders and
	Huimeijia shall only sell the 19 drug approval numbers (the Assets) to
	Xiuzheng Pharmacy. The Equity Holders will retain the equity interests in
	Huimeijia, but will have the equity interests pledged to Xiuzheng Pharmacy until
	the Assets are transferred. On October 12, 2016, the four parties agreed to
	rescind the Supplementary Agreement and entered into a new supplementary
	agreement, pursuant to which, the four parties agreed to execute the transfer of
	the equity interests based on the Original Agreement, and according to which the
	Equity Holders shall sell their respective equity interests in Huimeijia to
	Xiuzheng Pharmacy for a total cash consideration of RMB 8,000,000 (approximately
	$1,306,186) (the Purchase Price) to the Equity Holders. As of the date of this
	report, 40% of the Purchase Price was paid and the Company has completed the
	changes in business registration and Xiuzheng Pharmacy obtained the newly issued
	document evidencing its ownership on Huimeijia, which is the business license
	issued by the local State Administration of Industry and Commerce in Harbin
	(Harbin SAIC) to Huimeijia where the ownership of Huimeijia has now been
	recorded as held by Xiuzheng Pharmacy with Harbin SAIC and the legal
	representative (a person that is authorized to take most of the corporate
	actions on behalf of a company under the corporate laws in China) of Huimeijia
	has now become a person designated by the Buyer. The transfer of all the drugs
	to the Buyer and the remainder of the Purchase Price are pending to be
	processed. As of September 30, 2016, the results of operations of Huimeijia
	business are reflected in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements as discontinued operations.


	37







	Our business is conducted through our sales agents and sales
	personnel. We sell our products directly to end customers by our own sales
	personnel as well as our sales agents, operating primarily in Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
	Shanghai, Beijing, Anhui and Gansu, where most of our revenues are generated.
	Our sales through agents in Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Anhui and
	Gansu provinces accounted for 16%, 15%, 13%, 13%, 12% and 12% of our total sales
	from the continuing operations, respectively, for the three months ended
	September 30, 2016. Although we do not currently sell our products online, we
	expect to do so in the future.

	Revenue



	Total revenues from the continuing operations decreased by
	$775,900 or 39.67% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
	the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a
	decrease of $482,244 or 29.01% in Humankinds revenues and a decrease of
	$293,656 or 99.97% in HLJ Huimeijias revenues for the three months ended
	September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease of the
	sales revenue in Humankind was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume of
	Waterlilies Soft Capsule, which was caused by our shift of marketing focus from
	such product to Propolis and Black Ant Capsule. The decrease of the sales
	revenue in HLJ Huimeijia was primary due to the expiration of its GMP
	certificate on December 31, 2015. During the last three months prior to such an
	expiration date, HLJ Huimeijia reduced its production and marketing operation as
	more attention was paid to the preparation of manufacturing and technical
	improvement in order to meet the requirements for obtaining a new GMP
	certificate. Since the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, HLJ Huimeijia has
	ceased all production activities, reconstructed its equipment and production
	line for the purpose of applying for the new GMP certificate while selling
	inventory produced before the expiration of the GMP certificate.


	Our total cost of sales from the continuing operations
	decreased by $663,679 or 46.77% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
	compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily
	due to a decrease of $413,391 or 35.37% in Humankinds cost of sales and a
	decrease of $250,288 or 99.98% in HLJ Huimeijias cost of sales for the three
	months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which
	were primarily due to the decrease in sales volume of Humankind and HLJ
	Huimeijia.


	Our gross margin from the continuing operations decreased by
	$112,221 from $537,104 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $424,883
	for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was mainly due to
	the decrease in sales volume of Humankind and HLJ Huimeijia as discussed
	above.

	Total operating expenses from the continuing operations for the
	three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $48,299 or 9.10%, as compared
	to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in operating expenses was
	primarily attributable to an increase of $81,385 or 23.33% in selling, general
	and administrative expenses, partly offset by a decrease of $33,086 or 18.18% in
	depreciation and amortization expenses. The increase in selling, general and
	administrative expenses was mainly due to the increased professional fees and
	increased salaries for management for the three months ended September 30, 2016
	as compared to the same period in 2015. The decreased in depreciation and
	amortization expenses was primarily due to the disposal of property, plant and
	equipment of HLJ Huimeijia incurred during the second quarter of fiscal year
	2016.


	Total operating expenses from the discontinued operations
	decreased from $196 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to nil for the
	corresponding period in 2016.

	Interest Income and Interest Expense



	Interest income from the continuing operations was $19,909 for
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $18,107 for the three
	months ended September 30, 2015. This increase of $1,802, or 9.95%, was mainly
	due to the increased average balance of bank deposits compared with the same
	period of 2015.


	Interest expense from the continuing operations was $21,686 for
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $9,938 or 31.43%, as
	compared to $31,624 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease
	of interest expense was mainly due to the decrease of short-term loan interest
	rate.



	Investment Income



	During the three months ended September 30, 2016, investment
	income from the continuing operations was $225,093, as compared to nil for the
	same period in 2015. On July 5, 2016, our Company entered into a one-year
	financial management agreement with the principal in the amount of $8,997,526
	(RMB 60,000,000) at the expected annual rate of return of 10%.



	Income Taxes



	Income taxes from the continuing operations increased by
	$21,624, or 66.73%, from $32,406 for the three months ended September 30, 2015
	to $54,030 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase was due
	to the increase in income before income taxes of one of the Companys
	subsidiaries, Humankind, with an increase from $129,622 for the three months
	ended September 30, 2015 to $216,121 for the same period of 2016.



	Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations and Income
	(Loss) Per Share



	Net income from the continuing operations was $24,023 for the
	three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net loss of $30,140 for
	the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase of $54,163, or 179.70%
	in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in investment income in
	the amount of $225,093 and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense
	in the amount of $33,086, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of
	$112,221 and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of
	$81,385 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same
	period of 2015.


	Income per share was $0.0004 for the three months ended
	September 30, 2016 and loss per share was $0.0005 for the three months ended
	September 30, 2015, respectively. This increase was primarily a result of the
	above increase in net income.


	41








	Net Loss from Discontinued Operations



	Net loss from the discontinued operations was nil for the three
	months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $196 for the three months ended
	September 30, 2015.



	Net Income (Loss)



	As a result of the foregoing, we had net income of $24,023 for
	the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net loss of $30,336 for
	the same period in 2015. After deduction of non-controlling interest in loss,
	net income attributable to the China Health Industries Holdings was $24,023 for
	the three months September 30, 2016, and net loss attributable to the China
	Health Industries Holdings was $30,334 for the same period in 2015.



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	We believe our current working capital position, together with
	our expected future cash flows from operations, loans from our major
	shareholder, will be adequate to fund our operations in the ordinary course of
	business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements and other
	contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, this
	belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks, and
	there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the
	future.


	The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents
	position, our working capital, and our cash flow activities from the continuing
	operations as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and for the three months
	ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

	For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our net decrease
	in cash and cash equivalents from the continuing operations totaled $9,004,410,
	which comprised of net cash used in investing activities in the amount of
	$9,010,455 and the negative effect of prevailing exchange rates on our cash
	position of $94,784, offset by net cash provided by operating activities in the
	amount of $15,744 and net cash provided by financing activities in the amount of
	$85,085.

	For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our net decrease
	in cash and cash equivalents from the continuing operations totaled $287,478,
	which comprised of net cash used in investing activities in the amount of
	$28,182 and the negative effect of prevailing exchange rates on our cash
	position of $518,767, offset by net cash provided by operating activities in the
	amount of $210,290 and net cash provided by financing activities in the amount
	of $49,181.


	Our working capital from continuing operations at September 30,
	2016 was $25,638,029, compared to working capital of $25,518,206 at June 30,
	2016. This increase of $119,823 or 0.47% was primarily attributable to the
	increase in interest receivable in the amount of $224,938 and the decrease in
	taxes payable in the amount of $144,770, offset by the decrease in accounts
	receivable in the amount of $183,076 and the increase in related party debts in
	the amount of $77,446.


	Net cash provided by operating activities from the continuing
	operations was $15,744 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily
	attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable of $178,748, partially offset
	by an increase in taxes payable of $143,283. Net cash used in investing
	activities from the continuing operations was $9,010,455 for the three months
	ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the expenditure in short-term
	investment of $9,003,737. Net cash provided by financing activities from
	continuing operations was $85,085 for the three months ended September 30, 2016,
	attributable to proceeds from related party debts in the amount of $85,085. The
	negative effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the
	amount of $94,784 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly a
	result of the effect of the devaluation of the RMB to the USD on the significant
	amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company in RMB. The exchange
	rates from USD to RMB were 6.6685 to 1 and 6.6459 to 1 as of September 30, 2016
	and June 30, 2016, respectively, and the average exchange rate from USD to RMB
	was 6.6639 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.


	Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing
	operations was $210,290 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily
	attributable to net loss attribute to the Company from continuing operations in
	the amount of $30,138, depreciation and amortization expenses of $233,185 as
	reconciled, as well as an increase in accounts payables and accrued expenses of
	$61,205, offset by a decrease in wages payable with an amount of $85,462. Net
	cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $49,181 for
	the three months ended September 30, 2015, attributable to collections of
	related party debts in the amount of $49,181. The negative effect of exchange
	rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $518,767 for the
	three months ended September 30, 2015 was mainly a result of the effect of the
	devaluation of the RMB to the USD on the significant amount of cash and cash
	equivalents held by the Company in RMB. The exchange rates from USD to RMB were
	6.3556 to 1 and 6.2000 to 1 as of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015,
	respectively, and the average exchange rate from USD to RMB was 6.3033 for the
	three months ended September 30, 2015.

	Other than as described in this report, we have no present
	agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of
	businesses, products, product rights or technologies or any other material
	capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of,
	and/or investments in, products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements
	or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or
	investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources
	of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and/or investments. We
	may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at
	all. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue
	restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause
	substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.



	Related Party Debts



	We had related party debts from the continuing operations in
	the amount of $2,790,852 as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $2,713,406 as
	of June 30, 2016, an increase of $77,446 or 2.85% . The amount of related party
	debts mainly consists of a loan from Mr. Xin Sun, the CEO of the Company. The
	loan is unsecured and non-interest bearing and has no fixed terms of repayment.
	There was no written agreement for the loan. See Note 10.





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are
	currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position
	or results of operations.



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	We prepare the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements in accordance with US GAAP. These accounting principles require us to
	make judgments, estimates and assumptions on the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities at the end of each fiscal period, and the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during each fiscal period. We continually evaluate these
	judgments and estimates based on our own historical experience, knowledge and
	assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding
	the future based on available information and assumptions that we believe to be
	reasonable.


	There have been no material changes during the three months
	ended September 30, 2016 in the Companys significant accounting policies to
	those previously disclosed in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
	ended June 30, 2016.

	Controls and Procedures







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures
	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our
	reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
	Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
	periods specified by the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also
	designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and
	communicated to our management, including our chief executive and chief
	financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure.


	At the conclusion of the period ended September 30, 2016, we
	carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
	our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
	officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
	15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.) Based upon that evaluation, our principal
	executive and principal financial officer concluded that, due to the material
	weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as discussed in our
	annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as of the
	end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure
	controls and procedures were not effective to satisfy the objectives for which
	they are intended.


	Despite the material weakness reported above, our management
	believes that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
	in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition,
	results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented due to the fact
	that we have retained a consultant who has U.S. GAAP experience to assist us in
	the preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting




	No changes in our internal control over financial reporting
	have come to managements attention during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
	that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal
	control over financial reporting.




	Limitations on Controls




	Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and
	procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
	detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and
	operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not
	absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of
	controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud
	will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
	the Company have been detected.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
