MCig And A Rival: The Choice Is Easy - mCig, Inc. (OTCMKTS:MCIG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»MCig And A Rival: The Choice Is EasyMay.26.17 | About: mCig, Inc. (MCIG) David Butler Value, event-driven, ETF investing, commoditiesSummaryThe US marijuana space is still a dicey subject.Within this penny stock market, it pays to at least buy the companies with profits.MCig inc. has been doing well at shifting its business into a diverse approach while avoiding debt.Despite a ton of press on their South American operations, Medical Marijuana Inc. hasn't gained any real ground in terms of making a profitable business.(Please keep in mind, these stocks are not for regular portfolios. These are trading plays for the most part. It is reckless in my opinion to keep these kinds of equities in a risk-averse portfolio.) Four years ago, my cousin and I both took positions in reckless Marijuana penny stocks. Am I proud of it? No. But hey, never look back. You're not going that way. He purchased mCig inc. (OTCQB:MCIG). I bought into Medical Marijuana Inc. (OTCPK:MJNA). I took big flak from some over my stance on mCig inc. after they posted positive earnings through the end of 2016. Due to new developments, I might have been very wrong here. The company has expanded from simply making e-cigarettes (a competitive space with multiple players) to various avenues for growth and expansion. There might be a business here The profits haven't come from what was their core business. Assuming their numbers are honest, the "mCig" e-cigarette amounts to the smallest profitable portion of their business. The company has been shifted to what seems to be a construction firm; with its "Grow Contractors" division. They're basically using knowledgeable contractors to build greenhouses/cannabis cultivation sites for Marijuana dispensaries and collectives. This amounted to $2.4 million of total business; the largest source of sales for the company. The most profitable part of the business lies under the CBD segment. These CBD products (cannabis derived oils that are promoted to have health benefits) only had $1.2 million in sales, but definitely carried the best margins. Net income on the segment was $888k. I have to say, on paper this is good stuff. Revenues for mCig grew 158% year over year to $4.5 million. Net income is also nothing but gold as the company went from losses of ($1.4 million) to net income of $1.5 million for fiscal year 2017. I'd also argue the company has a good cash blanket for its activities. Cash/equivalents increased 1,369% year over year to $1.5 million. The balance sheet also looks good with no long term debt on the books. That's probably mCig's biggest redeeming virtue. It's not making big debt payments. On the flip side, it has drastically diluted its stock to do so. That $850,552 in profit amounts to nothing for shareholders considering the 342.04 million shares outstanding.
 Before anyone could really call this "intelligent" investing, we need to see a few more quarters proving this profitability to not be a onetime affair. I'd particularly like to see diluted earnings per share that actually contributed more than a penny to shareholders. Medical Marijuana inc. I bought MJNA back in 2014 when I was a naïve idiot. It was the height of "weed mania" when all the profitless, debt ridden penny stocks were blowing up. Sigh, the foolishness of my actions still gets to me. Though I only took a very small position in MJNA, it was a total waste of cash (I'd like to point out that at the time of writing this, they actually have their Q1'17 results mislabeled at 2016 on their website…come on, management). It eventually took a loss to move on to other things. Through the years, the tide hasn't really changed in MJNA's favor. Revenues have actually declined for the company annually. This has finally be countered as of late with some strong quarterly revenue growth. That revenue growth however has done nothing in terms of producing profits. A decidedly large amount of MJNA's assets now lie in Brazilian operations. MJNA has had such a tough time profiting from its business in the United States that it has moved some of its sales to South America. In the Brazilian market, some of their products can be prescribed by doctors for 10 approved conditions. A weak Product The firm's biggest claim to fame is CBD enriched chewing gum. Frankly, in an age where nations are progressively moving toward legalized cannabis, this seems like an unnecessary product. The fact that they had to get it to Brazil to obtain prescription relevance says it all. If you're investing in this space, mCig is clearly the more appealing option. Their shares are far less diluted. With over 3.13 billion basic shares, MJNA's diluted losses are always low per shareholders, as will be any profits. There would also have to be some profits for this to be a viable investment. MJNA was the first publicly traded Marijuana stock. It's been around a while. In that time, it hasn't found a niche. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the only real time of high net income with over $39 million; and it certainly didn't come from revenues of $1.57 million. With a loss of a little over $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, MJNA managed to drastically improve itself over last year's Q1 loss of $11.1 million. Nevertheless, negative income is negative income.
 mCig has profits; and far less in debt. Will they keep having profits? That's the question. That's the price you pay for getting involved in this space. For those intent on buying in, mCig has the clear advantage.

GlobeNewswire



Feb 20, 2015 8:35 AM EST













 




























































    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Feb. 20, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mCig® Inc. (OTCBB:MCIG), a leading provider of advanced technologies and solutions to the global cannabis industry, is excited to announce the official start of CBD product line releases and the launch of a new website specifically geared for vaporizer users at: www.justCBDoil.com. mCig is unveiling its new CHILL! Just CBD Oil Vape Pen at the Academy Awards Celebrity Gift Suite, where the product, along with accessory kits will be handed out to A-list celebrity guests and awards nominees for sampling Sat., February 21 st.  Derived from industrial hemp grown in Europe, mCig procures only the finest CBD in the world which undergoes extensive and rigorous purity testing. mCig, Inc.'s CBD products are assembled and manufactured in the USA by approved and registered FDA facilities, and lab tested again for quality assurance. The Company is preparing for the vast market opportunities ahead with CBD products, retail and wholesale distributions, and supply chain acquisitions to rapidly increase revenues and shareholder value.  The new product named CHILL! by justCBDoil.com is a revolutionary ultra-pure formula and patent-pending e-liquid that produces a maximum CBD effect unlike anything else currently available. mCig, Inc. has partnered with Just Chill Products, LLC in Melbourne, Florida to manufacture and distribute a new-to-market CBD Hemp Oil formula, initially released in prefilled tanks. Just CBD Oil's CHILL! Prefilled Tank is ready-made for the popular mCig 2.x model vaporizer device and fits any universal 510 threaded battery. Natural flavorings, larger tank sizes, and sleek new vape pens are also scheduled for upcoming release on www.justCBDoil.com.  "The response to this specific breakthrough CBD Hemp Oil formulation has been overwhelming and we anticipate record sales, reinforced with high reorder rates on www.justCBDoil.com, the exclusive online retail site for our new CBD vape e-liquid. mCig, Inc.'s quality CBD products are 100% legal in all 50 states and over 40 countries, ready for retail shelves, and we are actively pursuing multiple distribution agreements. mCig Inc. is gearing towards success as we continue to build our brand and expand our revenue streams," said Paul Rosenberg, mCig CEO.  About mCig, Inc.  Headquartered in Beverly Hills, CA, mCig, Inc. (MCIG) is a leading provider of advanced technologies and solutions to the global cannabis industry. mCig manufactures and markets best-selling portable and home vaporizers, extraction related equipment, CBD Rich Hemp Oil-derived products, and related nutraceuticals based on natural compounds found in Cannabis and Hemp plants. The company owns the mCig and Vapolution brands, and has a 47% stake in VitaCig (VTCQ), makers of the VitaStik, a disposable vitamin vaporizer. The company believes that a well-regulated marijuana industry is emerging as more states follow the lead of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington in legalizing marijuana. A similar trend is developing within the CBD and Hemp industries following overwhelming consumer demand.

OMHE sold VitaCig to MCIG for $72k, but declares FMV of $1,078,457 as revenue.  ACCOUNTING TRICK \  June 27,2016 MCIG Screws Over Minority VTCQ Shareholders by selling Shell. June 27,2016 OMHE sells VitaCig to MCIG for $72,000. http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mcig-acquires-vitacig-business-and-395m-in-moq-contracts-otcqb-mcig-2137644.htm    0 MME Certificate - Missed 8/8/2014 deadline. 2 Years gone by and MCIG has FAILED to purchase an MME Certificate in the open market  0 Service Contracts - Rollies MJ Cigarettes announced March 2016. MCIG still looking for partners as of Conference Call 6/28/16. MCIG now stating they are "negotiating" for a Nevada MME certificate per 12/20/16 CC.  Gonna Sell a bunch of Sangreen Grow Rooms from China? I don't think so. As others have noted, people can purchase Cannapods at half the price. I'm predicting that they sell <3 in the next 3 months. It's kind of hard when you have 95 phantom salespeople from a faux call center where noone answers the phone.  6/12/16 “Filling Services” http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mcig-rollies-announces-a-new-service-for-marijuana-cigarettes-otcqb-mcig-2141633.htm 0 Rolling/Filling Service Contracts - Rolling services and paper at $3/200 count available since 6/12/2016 - but the 36ish Nevada MME MJ dispensaries currently operating want no part of their filling services because it was a stupid business model to begin with.  In FACT, The Shyster LIED about Lucy's. 10/24/16 http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mcig-inc-ceo-provides-corporate-update-2168970.htm  2/2/17 Lucy's DENIES ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH VELLUM/ROLLIES/MCIG \   In addition all the vague terminology of "fully funded", "managed", etc....are very vague. Paul needs to specify which contracts still exist, what is involved for each phase of each project - and specify how much revenues are from consulting/managing vs. constructing.  0 Agent ID - because MCIG has FAILED to partner with a real MME Certificate holder and has FAILED to sign a service contract of any kind. That rumor/spin of the Rollie's MJ FAILURE is just another example of spinning - and ADDITIONAL FAILURE on MCIG's part.  FAIL - VitaStik DEBACLE Officially Swept under rug. MCIG has not PR'd what legal counsel advised them to do about their Glomar response on Paul intentionally selling the VitaStik Trademark, Intl distribution rights, and patents.   FAIL - Rollie's MJ Cigarettes is dead. All Rollie's has is a mock up of branded packaging and rolling papers. GINORMOUS DISAPPOINTMENT. Just freakin papers....lol.  MCIG HOSES MINORITY VTCQ SHAREHOLDERS WITH MAL-B-GONE REVERSE ACQUISITION. MCIG manages to get all operations and vitacig products, gets 10ish% of Mal-B-Gone - and manages to protect preferred shares from dilution in case of a reverse split - all which benefits the company, but screws over minority VTCQ shareholders as they only get unwanted shares of an unknown pharmacy company that can only muster $1sh Million in revenues after 41 years in business. Reverse Split likely will result in pps plummeting further. Minority VTCQ shareholders holding onto bag of losses and praying for an opportunity to sell.  LIE - Rollie's Pre-Orders. There were NEVER Rollie's MJ Cigarette Pre-orders. 5/24/16 http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=122862633   Quote: In my last conversation with Paul, he told me that he was pleased with the pre-orders for Rollies.  ~Les    6/15/16 http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=123320336 Quote: I remind you that they will be selling product in both California and Nevada. Whether they have written orders, whether written pre-orders are even legal at this time, or they have verbal commitments, or a wink and a nod, the point Paul was making was that they have customers identified and ready to accept product shipment on day one. Whatever language you use to describe that is irrelevant to shareholders but could be an issue for regulators in one or both of those states.  ~Les    6/15/16 http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=123318188 Quote: You want to argue semantics. Basically, when asked about preorders Paul said he was happy with Rollies pre-orders. Whether that means formal written orders or verbal commitments from dispensaries and grow ops.  ~Les    LIE - Rollie's MJ Cigarette Rollout Date LIE. Paul clearly lied about the Rollie's MJ Cigarette Rollout Date of June 2016.  Paul's mail showing June 2016 Rollout Date http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=123453800  5/9/16 http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=122507882 Quote: Rollies will be available in Nevada in June. They're waiting for their grow op partner to harvest product. They may be available in California even sooner. They recently received their packaging shipment and are ready for production (keep in mind that it's still illegal to transport MJ across state lines so production has to occur in each state). They are currently waiting for testing to be completed on some new cigarette packing equipment and it should be ready for operation within two weeks. Here are some pictures of the new packaging ready for production to begin...  ~Les    LIE - Paul intentionally signed away VitaStik. See the two images of his signature on USPTO documents and Green Leaf Farms documents. These signatures were NOT CUT AND PASTE. What makes it a LIE is that Paul gave people the impression that shareholders would reap royalties of overseas sales ALREADY KNOWING THAT HE HAD ALREADY SIGNED AWAY VITASTIK AND SHAREHOLDERS WOULD NEVER SEE A SINGLE PENNY FROM THOSE SALES. $0 royalties. ZERO. Paul HAS YET TO ADMIT THAT HE SIGNED AWAY VITASTIK AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY 2015.

RECYCLING OLD IDEAS TO BAIT AND STRING ALONG TRADERS/SHAREHOLDERS  Extractors - table top extractors, CO2 Extractors, Emotek Extractors  THC - MadHatter, Emotek, and now Blanks  Construction - the perfect vehicle for MCIG to bait with and string along shareholders.  Colorado extraction and cultivation facility was the first FAILURE. Green Leaf Construction PER CONTRACT will result in $0 net profits. It's CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT Green Leaf will likely benefit MUCH MORE vs. MCIG - NOT EVEN CLOSE. It's being projected that GL will earn $16 MILLLION in PROFITS over 2 years AND RECURRING REVENUES FOR EACH MJ HARVEST OF BUD AND TRIM.  What does MCIG get? $0 Net Profits and marketing credit. No joke, Marketing Credit!!  WRONG = no concessions or contingencies in construction contract WRONG = $430,000 Marketing credit can be declared as profit WRONG = MCIG will get “up to 25%” royalties for overseas VitaStik branded sales. Try 0% considering Paul sold VitaStik trademark to Al Santos  MCIG Positives The best company, second to none, at BAIT and NO EXECUTE.
