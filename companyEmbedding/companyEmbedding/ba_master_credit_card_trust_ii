Welcome to the World of Travel Cards
Every day, a new credit card seems to launch, with travel and cashback cards taking the lead. Similar in many ways, travel cards can be thought of as the “adult” card, because the miles or points can be quite valuable, and there’s a little more thought to making them work, in part because there can be an annual fee to leverage (more on that later).
Travel cards offer a twofold bonus. First, you can use them to maximize the returns on your travel spending, saving you hundreds of dollars a year. Second, some offer special access to travel rewards, such as free nights in swanky hotels, access to exclusive airport lounges and more. Not only can travel cards benefit those who work around the world or who often travel for pleasure, they can reap great rewards for the occasional traveler. Just think – earn statement credits for a weekend getaway or a quick trip out of town. Here’s what you need to know to find the best one:

General rewards rate
Travel rewards cards offer rewards as a points system, where the points have a certain cash value applicable toward travel spending. Often, these cards refer to points as miles. They are pretty much the same thing, although the values can vary, going above $0.02 and below $0.01 for every point or mile earned.
When earning, you can get up to $0.03 for every dollar spent for a specific category, such as restaurants or worldwide travel. Others will offer a flat 2:1 miles-per-dollar ratio on all purchases. Take stock of how much you spend, on average, for categories like restaurants, gas and yes, even airfare to decide which kind of travel card works best for you. 
Certain Chase cards will increase the rewards rate if you redeem them through their travel purchase portal.  You can also often redeem for clothing, electronics and other goods with many cards’ miles, although you may not get as good of a rate of exchange.
Sign-up bonus
Besides the general rewards plan, you should closely examine the sign-up bonus when deciding on a travel rewards card. You will have to meet a minimum spend requirement in the first few months, so know your budget going in, to ensure you can meet the goal. Make sure you have the money to pay it back in full and on time so you don’t incur interest fees, otherwise, you have defeated the purpose of getting a bonus.
Airline-specific perks
Airline-specific cards can offer unique perks, such as free checked bags, priority boarding or lounge access. If you have a loyalty to a certain airline, the right rewards rate combined with these perks may make them a superior deal compared to more general travel cards. 
Transfer partnerships
Some travel cards have partnerships with specific hotel and airline rewards programs, sometimes with a 1:1 ratio. So, even if you have a co-branded card, you might be able to use your miles on other brands. 
Fine print and fees
Certain offers come with blackout dates in which you can’t apply your miles to reservations for certain flights or nights in a hotel. They’re usually reserved for heavily trafficked times, such as holidays or days near major events. Again, having a plan comes in handy. Do you require fuss-free redemptions? Or do you travel enough during off-peak times that blackout dates won’t bother you?
Also, pay attention to expiration dates. Your miles can expire if you don’t use them by a certain deadline. Others  allow you to keep your miles as long as your account is active.
Some cards may require you to book through an airline’s website in order to apply your points to the cost of your flight.
Finally, some travel cards will offer a certain reimbursement amount if your trip is delayed. They can also have trip insurance, lost luggage reimbursement and other benefits.
Be mindful of annual fees. You’ll want to make sure you will use the card enough to offset an annual fee.  Also, cards specific to a hotel or airline may offset the annual fee cost with certain perks, like one free night’s stay or free flight every year you keep your account open. Many cards waive the fee for the first year.

Want more information?
Below are a variety of frequently asked questions and answers regarding travel rewards and programs. You can also read our detailed reviews of travel credit cards once you have narrowed your choices down to a few cards. The reviews can help you confirm which offer fits your needs. If you’re homing in on a card for a specific airline or hotel, we have reviews for those, too.
What is a travel credit card?
A travel credit card can reward you for travel behavior, such as eating at restaurants or staying at hotels. Some are loyalty cards in which you benefit from using specific hotel or airline brands. Others, such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, have an open-ended reward and redemption system that allows you to redeem for all manner of travel expenses.
Travel cards are an excellent way to get reimbursed for vacations, make purchases on shopping portals, gain access to airport lounges, get free baggage checks and more. Today, there is a huge selection of travel cards, so it’s important to shop around and pick the one that’s best for your lifestyle.
What are airline miles?
Airline miles were originally designed for airline loyalty programs in which you got credit in the way of “miles” for your spending on a card. Today, miles cards sometimes are not attached to a specific airline, such as Discover it Miles, or a card may have partnerships with a variety of airlines, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred.
There are also hotel travel cards, which will typically refer to the benefits as “points.” Whether called points or miles, these benefits can earn you savings in the hundreds each year. By putting miles toward flights or points toward hotel stays, you can get a statement credit for vacation expenses and more.
How do I get a travel credit card?
When you apply for a travel credit card, the card issuer will gather some information, including Social Security number, name and address, and income. Fill out the form honestly, because you can have the card revoked if you’re caught in a lie. Income can be money you have access to, rather than just your salary, so if you and your spouse are employed, you can combine the incomes. This is helpful if you are an at-home parent and the family has just one income.
Many cards will approve or decline you within minutes. If you are approved, you may be able to shop online with your new account. Your card will arrive within a few days in the mail.
How to compare travel credit cards
Here's how to compare travel credit cards:
Track your spending for 2 months. You'll want to see how much you spend on items such as groceries and gas.
Study a mix of travel cards, including Chase Sapphire Preferred, Delta Gold from American Express and Barclaycard Arrival Plus. Each has a specific type of model: The Sapphire Preferred offers a vast variety of partnerships with airlines and hotels; the Delta Gold rewards you for spending at a specific brand; and the Arrival Plus is a good choice for general travel.
Compare the signup bonuses and decide if you can afford the required spend. Also, look at the annual fees and compare to the benefits your receive, such as free baggage checks, miles earned, and rental car insurance.
Why do creditors offer travel cards?
On the surface, it doesn't make sense why creditors or credit card issuers offer travel credit cards.  But it makes sense, once you understand the issuer business model. Here's how it works:

Card issuers charge fees such as late payment fees, annual fees, balance transfer fees and cash advance fees. For example, when you transfer a balance to your new card, you are usually charged a 3%-5% fee or $5-$10, whichever is greater. Even if the card offers a 0% intro APR, and you pay your balance by the time the offer ends, the bank still gets a take.
Card issuers, as you probably know, benefit from interest fees you pay when you carry a balance past a month. These fees are hefty, with the average APR running at about 15%. If you make a $500 purchase and your APR is 17%, a monthly minimum payment will mean that you pay for 24 months and pay $92 in interest. Great for the issuer, not so amazing for you. That's why it's important not to carry a balance, or you'll wash away the earnings you've made with your travel card.
Card issuers and networks earn a processing fee for each transaction that is typically paid by the merchant. Called interchange fees, they are based on the volume and value of transactions. Usually, the consumer is not impacted by this fee, which can be a percentage of the transaction of say, about 2%, plus a flat fee of perhaps $0.10 per transaction. That said, you can be charged a “checkout fee” for using your card.

With all these fees floating around, what do you do? First off, pay in full and on time each month. That will keep you from paying late fees and interest fees. Also, keep an emergency fund so you won't be tempted to take out a cash advance. Finally, ask the merchant if you are being charged a checkout fee for using your Visa or MasterCard. If so and it's a big purchase, you may want to think about shopping elsewhere.
What are the advantages of a travel credit card?
Travel cards have a number of advantages, including the ability to earn statement credits for travel and sometimes luxury benefits, such as access to airport lounges.
If you are loyal to a specific hotel or airline brand, you can earn double miles for spending on that brand and even earn stays and other loyalty benefits. Some cards, such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, allows you to earn 2X miles on everything, then you can earn a statement credit on travel purchases of your choosing. This allows you to shop around for the best hotel, airline, limousine service, condo, rental car, and so on. Add to that, your miles don’t expire, although there can be a deadline for redeeming a specific purchase.
What are the disadvantages of a travel credit card?
There are a few disavantages to travel cards, but nothing that can’t be overcome.
As you know, travel cards can have an annual fee, but that doesn’t have to be a disadvantage. Simply make sure you will spend enough to cover the fee. If, for example, you have a $59 annual fee and you get 2X miles on every purchase, you’ll need to spend a minimum of $3,000 throughout the year to get 6,000 miles, which is enough to cover the annual fee.
Another challenge, and this is true for all credit cards, is that you can incur interest fees if you carry over a balance. There’s an easy answer, though. Just don’t charge anything you don’t already have the money to cover, and pay in full and on time each month.
How do frequent flyer credit cards work?
Frequent flyer credit cards reward you more for airline-related expenses including baggage checks, tickets, and food and drink. The higher end cards might also gain you access to such benefits as brand-specific airport lounges. The more you use the card on airline expenses, the more you benefit with miles that can be redeemed for flights.
Heads up that frequent flyer miles can expire, so read the fine print. Also, there can be blackout dates, so before taking out a card, make sure it’s a product you’ll use based on your current habits. Do you only travel for the holidays? Do you not really have an interest in airport lounges? That will impact the card you apply for.
How do you use your airline miles?
Cards vary widely when it comes to using your airline miles. Some cards offer a portal that allows you to redeem for qualified packages, flights, hotels and condos, and more, such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus. The Arrival Plus allows you to redeem on any qualifying travel expense through a card portal that tracks how many points you need to redeem an item and how much more time you have to redeem for each item. Others limit how you use the miles to specific brands. For example, the American Express Delta cards’ miles can be specifically used for Delta flights and other Delta expenses.
What are bonus miles?
Many travel cards offer a signup bonus in which you spend a certain amount on your card within a certain period of time, usually 3 months or 90 days, in exchange for a one-time bulk of miles or points. Some cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred, also give you points for behaviors such as signing up your first authorized user within a certain amount of time. You typically have to be a new cardholder.
While the bonus miles are a great draw for the new cardholder, there are a couple of things you want to make sure about before signing up. First, do you have the cash on hand to pay back the purchases you make to qualify for the bonus? You’ll want to be able to pay it back by the due date of that month, or you’ll incur interest charges, which basically would defeat the purpose of the bonus miles. Remember, a credit card is not designed to be a long-term loan.
Second, are you going to use the card enough to make the annual fee worth your while? Calculate how many miles you need to make up for the fee, even if the fee is waived the first year, because you want to consider a card to be a financial product for the long haul. Why? Because the longer you keep a card and treat it well, the better it is for your credit.
How many miles does it take to get a free flight?
Miles redemptions for a flight vary widely, and it depends on the type of ticket you want (ie. First class) and when and where you travel, but for example, on an Oct. 28, 2016, Delta flight from LAX to JFK (main cabin), it would have run you 25,000 miles.
Miles can also be used to upgrade your seat, purchase a companion’s ticket or buy refreshments. Miles often don’t expire (read the fine print), so it can be worth your while to save up for a big trip. Just double down on paying for things you would buy anyway to earn those miles. Sometimes you can pay rent, car insurance and utilities with your credit card. Just make sure there are no fees for those charges.
How do you use a travel credit card to save money?
Using a travel card to save money only works if you use your card for purchases you plan to make anyway and if you pay your card bill in full and on time each month. That way, you avoid late fees and interest charges. You also want to make sure that your planned spending will put your miles or points above the annual fee. So, if you have an annual fee of $95, and the redemption is at $0.01 for every mile, you want to make sure you plan to earn at least 9,500 miles or points in a year.
Ideally, you want to focus on your best travel or rewards card, and put as many purchases as possible on it so that you earn maximum miles.
What do you need to consider before getting an airline credit card?
4 things to consider before getting an airline credit card:

Are you going to earn more points or miles than the value of the annual fee? This can be a deal-breaker, because there is no point is taking out a card that you won’t be using to the fullest extent.
Will you be able to pay off the balance each month and on time? Again, you don’t want to be in a situation where you are paying interest charges each month. Only put charges on your card that you can pay off by the deadline.
Will you have an opportunity to use the miles or points? You don’t have to be a big traveler to take advantage of many cards, but you want to make sure this is a card that you will benefit from.
If it’s a loyalty card, will you realistically use it for that brand without cramping your style? If you aren’t dedicated to a particular brand of hotel or airline, there are a number of great cards that allow you the freedom to use all manner of travel brands.

How do you strategically use an airline credit card?
9 strategies to maximize airline rewards:

Research thoroughly before choosing your card. Read the fine print. Do miles expire, and when? Are there blackout dates? Can you live with the limitations?
Make it your go-to card. See if you can pay your rent or utilities with it. Buy your groceries with it.
Don’t spend just to earn miles. Only use it to buy what you were going to buy anyway.
If you can’t pay it off in full each month, there’s no point in acquiring it. The interest fees will overshadow any miles or points you’ve earned.
Never go over the limit or pay late. These are wasted dollars.
Letting points expire are a waste. Keep track of when points are due to expire and plan ahead to use them so you aren’t wasting them on expensive travel dates. Also, with some programs, earning just one point can reset the expiration date.
Stay flexible and try a variety of travel dates when redeeming. For example, international flights are sometimes cheaper midweek. And flying on Christmas Day can be cheaper than flying on Christmas Eve.
Sign up for loyalty programs, use shopping portals and use travel portals that might earn you additional points, such as the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. Frequently check for deals.
Make a goal to use points for a trip, then do it.

What do you look for in a travel rewards credit card?
Here are 7 things to look for in a travel rewards credit card:

Is it flexible enough for your needs? There’s no point in taking out a card if you’ll never redeem the miles.
Will you earn more points than the cost of the annual fee? This is a deal breaker.
Will you use it without overspending? Never carry over a charge from month to month.
Are the benefits, such as complimentary auto rental insurance or airport lounges, items you will use? If not, there may be a good card for you with a lower annual fee.
Do you want a card with a shopping portal? This is a great way to save some money, although heads up that the rate of exchange can be lower.
Will you use the loyalty program, if there is one? For example, hotel brands might offer one free night after a certain number are purchased.
Are blackout dates or points expiration rules a deal breaker? As always, read the fine print.

How much is a frequent flyer mile worth?
While a frequent flyer mile is often worth $0.01, it can be more or less, depending on the program. For example, according to our valuation system, the Discover it Miles valuation is $.01 for every mile, while the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal, with the Chase Sapphire Preferred, is valued at $0.0126. That means if you have accumulated 30,000 miles with your Discover it Miles card, those miles are worth $300. If you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred and you want to redeem them in the Ultimate Rewards portal, you will get the equivalent to $378 when you redeem. (CreditCards.com’s valuation system: A reward value is determined by calculating the cost per reward unit [point or mile] for obtaining a good or service.)
How do you redeem airline miles?
When redeeming airline miles, sometimes it’s as simple as going into a portal after the purchase and clicking a button. In other cases, such as the American Express Delta cards, you log into your Delta account to purchase your tickets. Before choosing a card, make sure you are clear about the steps and decide if you can live with those steps.
In the same way that you need to make sure that you’ll take full advantage of the card’s benefits and that you’ll maximize the savings, you want to ensure that the way that you redeem suits your lifestyle. Some cards are very easy to use, allowing you to redeem for pretty much anything that is travel-related, including limousine service. Others allow you to maximize your miles with a travel portal that gives you a bonus for redemptions.
Do frequent flyer miles expire?
Frequent flyer miles often expire. Some, such as Delta, don’t. Others require your account to remain active, although that can be as simple as earning a single mile before the expiration date. Make sure you read the fine print so you aren’t scrambling to use your miles.The key is to stay organized. Plan a specific trip for your miles and budget how many miles you need to earn to reach your goal. Never, ever, go over what you can afford, and mark on your calendar when the miles would expire.
Can you transfer airline miles to hotel points?
Usually you can’t transfer airline miles to hotel points, but there are exceptions. The question is really: Should you do it? The answer to that is typically no, because the transfer ratios are rarely favorable. It’s best to choose your card carefully and make sure you will use it well.
Before applying for a card, look at your past history. Do you love and use the brand that the card co-brands with? Have you used that brand in the past, and will you use it in the future? How often will you use it? If you can see yourself earning enough points or miles to make the card worthwhile, go for it.
Can you transfer miles to another person?
You might be able to transfer miles to another person, but it may not be to your advantage financially because you may be charged a fee for the transfer. Instead, book an award seat for someone else by entering their name instead of yours in the portal. Just keep in mind that in the case of international flights, some airlines require to see the card that was used. Sometimes, even the cardholder has to be present at flight time, or the ticket isn’t honored.
Can you transfer miles from one airline to another?
Typically, you can’t transfer miles directly between airline loyalty programs, although you may be able to earn and redeem miles for flights on partner airlines. In fact, in some cases, partnerships offer a 1:1 ratio.
Research which airlines your card’s co-brand has partnerships with, taking special care to look for airlines that fly out of your city or to destinations you often travel to. Also, research the transfer ratio.
Before applying for a card, research several cards, because the best deal may not be your favorite brand. You may in fact find that a more general card will give you more generous miles earned or that a card includes partnerships with your favorite brand.
Is a travel credit card right for me?
There are a few factors that will help you decide if a travel card is right for you.
First, do you have strong credit? Travel cards typically require good or excellent credit, so there is no point in applying unless you have at least a 700 FICO score, the dominant scoring model that lenders use. It has a range of 300-850, with 850 as the best.
Do you have a good handle on your finances? To maximize a travel card, you need to be able to juggle a couple of balls. It’s not difficult, but if you are not sure how much money is coming in, how much you spend each month, and what you are spending it on, you may want to hold off on getting a travel card. Why? Because to use the travel card successfully, you will want to use the card as much as possible, but never on something you don’t already have the money for. A cashback card such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited may be a better choice for you for now, because it offers a straight 1.5% cash back and there’s no annual fee.
Finally, do you travel at least somewhat? You don’t have to be a jetsetter, but to take full advantage of the card, you’ll want to at least be someone who travels a couple of times a year, or on a few weekend trips a year. The best way to assess this is to look at your travel habits in the past year, study how much you spent, and track which airlines and hotels you stayed at.
With a little effort on the front end, a travel card can save you hundreds a year on travel expenses, give you free nights or even flights, or even grant you access to luxury airport lounges. Find the right card for you.

A balance transfer can be a great way to consolidate payments and avoid interest if you're carrying a balance. With the right card, you can even reap rewards and benefits after you pay off the transferred balance. If you know how these offers work, and you know what other perks to look for, you can find the best balance transfer card to minimize your interest and maximize your rewards.
If you're not familiar with balance transfers, our balance transfer card reviews will help you discover what the details of each card are, and show you what rewards are worth.
What is the meaning of balance transfer?
A balance transfer means you transfer the balance from one credit card to a card typically with a lower interest rate.  Let's say you have $3,000 on Card A with a 17% APR. That means if you pay the minimum amount, it will take you 126 months and you will pay $2,241 in interest. If you transfer that $3,000 to Card B, with an introductory 0% APR for 18 months, that means you have 18 months to pay off the balance without paying interest fees, thereby potentially avoiding the cost of $2,241.  Balance transfers are also an option if you want to streamline your payments. Simply transfer your balances to a single card and make one payment a month.
What is a balance transfer card?
A balance transfer card is a credit card that consumers typically use to avoid paying a higher interest fee.  The balance on Card A is transferred to Card B, which may have a low or 0% introductory APR. Credit card companies will sometimes attract new customers with little to no interest for a set period, sometimes as long as 21 months, such as the Citi Simplicity. Balance transfer cards may also have a 0% introductory APR for purchases. For example, the Simplicity has an introductory 0% APR of 21 months for purchases. Each credit card specifies which balances will be paid first typically starting with the lowest–rate balances. Some balance transfer card rules specify that only transferred balances qualify for the lower rate, while new purchases collect interest at the regular, higher APR.
What is a balance transfer fee?
A balance transfer fee is the charge for transferring a balance from one credit card to another. The more you transfer, the larger the fee. A typical fee is 3%–5%, with a minimum of $5 or $10. For example, if you transfer a $10,000 debt from another card, you might pay a $300 fee right away. While that expense may seem hefty, assess whether you will actually save by transferring to a 0% introductory APR card to avoid interest fees, because you can easily spend thousands on interest fees. However, make sure you will be able to pay off the debt by the time the introductory offer ends, because the new card will likely revert to a go–to APR that can be 15% or more. See if it makes sense for you by using our balance transfer calculator.

Keep in mind that some balance transfer cards don't have balance transfer fees, such as the Barclaycard Ring Mastercard.
What is a balance transfer intro period?
A balance transfer introductory period refers to a low or 0% APR offer a credit card issuer provides for a limited period of time as an incentive to become a cardholder. A cardholder can pay down debt transferred from another card while not paying interest for the debt for an introductory period of time. A balance transfer intro period can last up to 21 months. After the set period, the interest rate can increase to a “go–to rate” of 15% or more. You should make sure you evaluate the balance transfer interest rate during the promotional period, the length of the promotional period, and the balance transfer fee when deciding which balance transfer offer is best for you.
What is balance transfer intro APR?
An introductory APR period is the amount of time you have to pay off the amount you've transferred without paying interest. A 0% APR period can last up to 21 months. Most balance transfer cards, with a few exceptions, charge you to move your balance. Generally, this fee is a percent of the balance you're transferring ranging from 3% to 5% depending on the card or $5–$10, whichever is greater. Since most cards' default rate can be higher than the rate you had on your old card, paying off your debt within the 0% period is crucial. Read the fine print, as some cards will void the 0% deal if you miss a payment.
How does a balance transfer on a credit card work?
Transferring the balance from one credit card to a card with a lower APR is referred to as a balance transfer. It should be noted that transferring isn't the same as repaying. When you use a balance transfer card, you are transferring the debt from Card A to Card B. Then, if Card B has an introductory offer, you can typically have a set amount of time, up to 21 months, to pay off the debt without paying any interest fees, although there can be a balance transfer fee. Other reasons to transfer a balance can be to consolidate your debts. However, avoid closing a credit card account, because having available credit helps your credit rating. So, if you transfer debt from Card A, now you have a card without any debt, which increases your credit utilization ratio (the ratio of your available credit to how much you owe). The lower the ratio, the better. That means if you keep Card A open, your available credit is boosted, and your ratio is lower. Also, Card A's payment history can help your credit. Just be sure to keep Card A's account active by charging a small monthly amount, and pay it on time and in full each month.
Are credit card balance transfers a good idea?
Transferring a credit card balance can be a good idea if you've incurred card debt and you are paying the minimum monthly amount. That can translate to high monthly APR fees that can be avoided if you transfer your debt to a card with a 0% introductory APR. However, make sure you have a plan to pay off the debt before the introductory offer ends, because balance transfer cards typically have a “go–to” rate that can be 15% or more once the offer ends.

Another good reason for transferring a card balance is consolidation. If you have debt on multiple cards, and you want to avoid the hassle of multiple payments, taking out a good balance transfer card can be wise. However, get to the root of the problem. Why do you have debt on multiple cards? If you are using your credit cards to buy items not in your budget, the problem may not be the cards. It may be your spending habits.

Also, taking out a new credit card to transfer a balance can be a bad idea if you are planning to take out an installment loan (a car loan or a mortgage) in the coming months, because lenders look for “hard pulls” or evidence of recent requests for credit. If you plan to buy a car or house soon, weigh whether any card debt you have could impact your application with whether lenders would be concerned about new cards. When in doubt, check with your lender before making any financial move.
Do balance transfers help your credit?
A balance transfer can certainly improve your credit – in the long term. A number of aspects of your credit score come into play when you transfer a balance to a new credit card, notably your payment history, which is your history of on–time payments, and your credit utilization, which is your available credit compared to your debt. To a lesser extent, the length of your old card's history and taking out a new card can also impact your credit. Here's how:

 Payment History
The most important (and most obvious) factor in play during a balance transfer is the opportunity to establish a better payment history. Payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score, the scoring model most used by lenders. Transferring debt from a high interest account to one with a 0% APR into period can significantly lessen the burden of maintaining a monthly payment schedule. You may have to pay a lump sum upfront in the form of a transfer fee, but the money you will save on interest can more than make up for it over time. If you pay more than the minimum amount and establish a plan to pay off the transferred balance before the introductory period expires, you will be debt–free years before you would if you pay the minimum. This will both save you money and improve your financial responsibility in the eyes of future creditors.
Credit Utilization
Along with an improved payment history, balance transfers can boost your credit by lowering your credit utilization (limit–to–balance) ratio. In fact, the second most important part of your FICO score is amount owed, at 30%. The credit utilization ratio is a measure of the debt you owe in comparison to the credit limit available to you. If you keep the old, paid–off card, that automatically boosts your ratio, because you have available credit with no debt. However, don't incur any additional debt once the new credit line has been established, or you'll defeat the purpose of building credit and get yourself back in your debt predicament.
Length of Credit History
Some 15% of your FICO score is made up by the length of credit history. And that's another great reason to keep your old card, so that you continue building your time with an older product.
New Credit
Some 10% of your FICO score is made up by new credit in your file. That's actually a reason to pause before taking out a balance transfer card – a new credit product can ding your rating, albeit not by much. Just be deliberate about your card choice, and make sure you don't have plans to take out an installment loan (car loan or mortgage) in the coming months, because lenders will be looking for any new products when they review your file.
Credit Mix in Use
The remaining 10% of your FICO score encourages a mix of credit products, such as credit cards and installment loans. For this reason, don't take out a balance transfer card without a plan, but a new balance transfer card can help your credit by allowing you to consolidate and to help you pay down your card debt.

Are balance transfers bad for your credit?
Used incorrectly, balance transfers can be bad for your credit. Used right, it can be great for your credit. Here's what you need to know:

When you apply for a balance transfer credit card – or any type of credit – it dings your credit. As a result, your credit score will drop by a few points. But if you plan to use the card to get your debt under control, that benefit can outweigh the disadvantage of those few lost points, which will be recovered within a few short months of good payment habits.
Planning to cut loose of that old card that has been weighing on your credit soul? Hold up, because a paid–off card with good credit payment history is credit gold. Here's how: First, the FICO scoring model likes it when you have a lot of available credit, but not much debt. So, if you keep the old card, you've increased your available credit when you take out the new card, and your percentage of debt goes down because of that additional available credit. Second, FICO loves credit accounts with a history of on–time payments, so it's worth your while to hang on to that card.
You've made the right decision to keep your old card, but you plan to lock it up in a sock drawer. Stop! By not using your old card, you run the risk of letting the account lapse, and that payment history clock stops. Keep using the card each month, but responsibly. More on that later.
Although you need to keep using your old card, you don't want to incur additional debt, because then your credit utilization ratio – remember the debt to available credit percentage? – will be too high. Here's what to do: Put a small monthly charge you would have anyway, such as your gym membership, on auto debit. But be sure to pay in full each month.
In some cases, making a payment even a single day late can cause the issuer to cancel your 0% APR period and leave you immediately subject to the high interest rates you sought to escape in the first place. Also, this will affect your payment history, so be sure to pay on time, or your credit will be surely affected.

Things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card
Balance transfer credit cards are a great way to improve your credit, used correctly. Used incorrectly, these cards can wreak havoc on your credit.
There are 5 things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card.

Can I withstand the credit score effects?
Applying for a new card requires a hard inquiry, which will temporarily drop your credit score. This can be recovered rather quickly and is generally not cause for worry. However, if you plan to take out an installment loan in the next few months, such as a car loan or a mortgage, these slight dings impact the interest rates or even whether you can land the loan of your choice. If your new card is the only credit you have on the horizon, then the drop in points will be temporary and relatively harmless, provided you continue to pay on time and keep your debt down.
What is the available credit limit?
The credit limit should be sufficient to cover the desired transfer amount without maxing out the new account. This way, you can take maximum advantage of the lower interest rates and improve your credit utilization ratio simultaneously. This ratio looms large for the FICO scoring model, the model most used by lenders. It is the amount of available credit you have compared to the amount of debt you have. The lower the percentage of debt, the better. That means the higher the new card's limit, the better, because any credit you aren't using counterbalances your debt.
How much is the transfer fee?
Low interest or 0% intro APR transfer cards usually require a transfer fee that typically ranges between 3% and 5% of the balance or $5–$10, whichever is greater. In most cases, this fee is minuscule in comparison to the interest charges you would otherwise pay and is therefore a good tradeoff. However, if the balance is low enough, it may not be worth paying the transfer fee in the first place. It's also worth noting that some card issuers waive the balance transfer fee, such as the Barclaycard Ring Mastercard.
How long is the introductory APR period?
The appeal of a balance transfer card comes in the form of a low or 0% intro APR, but these rates don't last forever. These teaser rates can be for up to 21 months, such as the Citi Simplicity. Look at all the card's benefits, though, because some cards have a shorter intro APR, such as the Blue Cash Everyday, yet they offer an introductory cashback offer and cash back for such purchases as groceries and gas. (Terms apply.) Think about how you'll use your card in the long haul. That said, make sure you only use such a card for purchases you can afford to pay off and after the balance transfer is paid so that you don't return to the cycle of debt you're trying to escape. Some cards, such as the Blue Cash Everyday, have a 0% intro APR for purchases as well.
Can I stay disciplined throughout the process?
Be true to yourself. If not, you could only worsen your existing situation. If you struggle with making monthly payments on time or don't trust your ability to cease acquiring debt, having another card at your disposal is probably not the best option. In fact, you may have difficulty even getting a new card if you have a history of late payments. Conversely, if you feel you are responsible enough to stick to the plan you have set for yourself, a balance transfer can bring you budgetary glory. If you think you can keep the old card active without incurring new debt, and you can pay down your new card without buying new items, a balance transfer card could be right for you.

How to select the right balance transfer card
Looking to land a balance transfer credit card? Here's how to select the right one for you:

Required credit scoreEven rejected applications require a hard inquiry and will ding your credit. Make sure you are within range of the card issuer's required credit. For a card that requires good credit, you need a FICO score of about 700 on a scale of 300–850. The higher the score, the more likely you'll land the card, although other factors also play in, such as multiple inquiries and wages. If you have your eye on a card that requires excellent credit, plan to have a score of at least 760, possibly more.
Sufficient credit limitThe available credit line should be substantial enough to cover the sum you're looking to transfer. Ideally, you would like to have a credit limit that allows for a full transfer and some breathing room. The higher your limit, the better, not because you can spend it, but because you won't. If you have air in your limit, or available credit that isn't being used, that can help boost your credit score.
Balance transfer feeMost balance transfer cards have a transfer fee of 3%–5% or $5–$10, whichever is greater. But some, such as the Chase Slate, offer for an introductory period of no transfer fee.
Lengthy introductory periodBalance transfer cards will offer low or 0% intro APR for up to 21 months. Use our handy–dandy payoff calculator to see how much time you need to pay each month and pay off the balance before the introductory offer ends. You don't want to get into a situation where you still have a balance when the offer ends, so choose wisely.
Reasonable ongoing APRWhile you don't want to have a balance remaining when the introductory offer ends, pay attention to the go–to APR rate, which is the interest rate your account will revert to once the offer ends. Ultimately, the go–to rate shouldn't matter, because you are paying your card bill in full and on time each month (right?), but it's good to pay attention to the details, just in case.
Annual feeOn the surface, you want a card without an annual fee, right? But annual fees are sometimes waived the first year, and the benefits of a card (such as cash back on a Blue Cash Preferred) can make the annual fee worthwhile. Think in the long term about how you plan to use your new card. If you solely want it for the introductory APR offer, you don't want an annual fee. If you plan to make it your go–to card once the balance is paid off, expand your horizons and look at balance transfer cards with bonus signup points or cash back and other perks.
Acceptable terms & conditionsThere are usually conditions that must be adhered to in order to take full advantage of the balance transfer. For example, an issuer will likely require a transfer to be completed within a specified amount of time to lock in the offered rates. In other cases, the introductory APR may be nullified if you are late on a single payment and the regular APR could kick in immediately. ALWAYS read the fine print!

How do you transfer a balance from one credit card to another?
Transferring a balance from one credit card to another is pretty straightforward. 
Simply place a call to the new creditor's customer service line. Communicate that you would like to transfer a balance onto your new card and a representative will guide you from there. You may also accomplish this online, though the exact procedure will vary depending on the bank. Heads up that you will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee, although some cards do not charge one, such as Barclaycard Ring Mastercard. Also, make sure you get terms with the new card that will allow you to pay the debt in full by the end of the introductory offer. So, if you owe $3,600 and the offer is 0% APR for 12 months, that means you need to make sure you can pay $300 a month for a year. That way, you don't pay interest rates on the balance.
How long does it take to transfer a balance from one credit card to another?
Generally, a balance transfer can be expected to clear within 7 days of the request being placed. However, the exact amount of time it will take varies and is dependent on a number of issues. Many people report that their balance transfers have been accomplished in under 48 hours while others have complained of a transfer taking upwards of two weeks to complete. Unfortunately, there's no clear–cut timeline.
In order to better gauge how long a transfer will take, consider the following factors:

Account AgeIf your account with the receiving creditor has been active prior to the transfer request, it will likely complete more quickly than with a newly opened account.
Transfer ProcessIf the money can be transferred electronically to the creditor, it will often take less time than payment via physical check.
Balance AmountLarge balances may take longer to complete, whereas balances of less than a specified amount could be fast–tracked in accordance with issuer policy.
Issuer/CreditorSimply, some banks just have a better reputation when it comes to completing balance transfers. Chase and Citi are two that come to mind.
Application MethodIf possible, submit your application online to ensure quality control; information relayed over the phone is subject to being misunderstood or incorrectly entered.
Time of RequestIs it close to the weekend? Are there any major holidays coming up? If so, the process might be delayed until normal business resumes.

Can you transfer a balance from one card to another from the same bank?
Typically, a bank does not allow a balance transfer between two cards it has issued. That's because it doesn't make good business sense for the financial institution. After all, banks and card issuers operate to make money on the debt you owe and a balance transfer represents a means of saving the cardholder money on that debt.
That said, the structure of a balance transfer exists as a win–win for all parties involved when the debt is being transferred from one creditor to another, as it is almost always done. This way, both parties are satisfied for the following reasons:

The new creditor takes on an existing debt but, more importantly, gains a new customer.
The customer pays a relatively modest transfer fee (typically 3% to 5% of the balance) but saves money in the long run by taking advantage of the 0% intro APR period and lower interest rates.

How to properly use a balance transfer card
Here are tips to properly use a balance transfer card:

Cease applying for new cardsOnce you get a balance transfer card, don't take out any more cards. Every time a card issuer checks your credit, which is done when you apply for a card, that dings your credit rating. A cluster of inquiries may paint you as being financially unstable. Also, additional cards only increase the temptation to spend.
Keep existing accounts openThe average age of your accounts is taken into consideration when determining your creditworthiness. Therefore, keeping older, established lines of credit active following a transfer only helps your credit rating. It will also help you obtain a more admirable credit utilization ratio, which is the second most important factor taken into account by lenders. The ratio compares the available credit to the amount owed. The closer to 0% the better. Finally, charge a small amount on your old card that you would spend anyway, and pay in full and on time each month. That keeps your account active, and it will actually help build your credit in no time.
Stick to your payment planBy now you should have planned out a strategy that will allow you to pay off the full balance before the introductory period runs out. This includes budgeting for any necessary fees, determining how much you will need to pay each month and identifying all stipulations that must be observed as part of the balance transfer agreement.
Stop incurring additional debtQuit adding to the problem. After all, there's a reason you sought a balance transfer in the first place. Halting charges on both the old and new accounts will save you from paying on the interest rates you fled and will make it much easier to abide by your payment schedule if the remaining balance isn't in constant fluctuation. Also, when you make new purchases, you run the risk of incurring interest fees, even while you are trying to pay off your old debt.

While 0% introductory offers are a great way to get out from under crushing debt, they can be a great way to get deeper into a hole, as well.
With a 0% offer, you can pay off debt interest-free for up to 21 months, depending on the card, saving you hundreds of dollars in interest fees. But it's important to have a plan for how you're going to pay off the charges. How much can you pay down each month? Will you be able to pay off the charges before the offer ends? Otherwise, you'll just pay interest fees on the charges once the offer ends.
The trick is to understand the rules of the game before committing to this kind of card. From balance transfer fees to go-to rates, we'll tell you how to choose a 0% intro interest card, pitfalls to avoid and how to use it going forward.
What are 0% APR credit cards?
Some credit cards have 0% introductory APR offers. What does that mean? Simply that you pay no interest on a card balance for a set amount of time, up to 21 months. This is handy when you've incurred debt and you can't get out from under the interest fees or you have a big purchase coming up.
There are basically two types of offers, sometimes in a single card:

Balance Transfer — This 0% intro APR offer encourages you to transfer your balances from older cards to the card with the offer. There is usually a balance transfer fee of 3%–5% or $5–$10, whichever is greater, but it can still be worth your while if you have a larger balance. That's because interest rates compound quickly, with you owing hundreds of dollars in interest within a few months.
Purchases — You can make a big purchase on your new card and pay interest–free for a set amount of time.

What does 0% intro APR mean?
The term “0% intro APR” means that you can pay interest–free for a set amount of time on balance transfers and/or purchases. The offer's length of time varies by card and can be as little as 6 months and as long as 21 months. For example, the Discover it offers an intro 0% APR on purchases for 6 months and a 0% APR on balance transfers for 18 months, while the Citi Diamond Preferred offers a 0% intro APR on both purchases and balance transfers for 21 months.
Heads up that there is usually a balance transfer fee, and if you are late paying, the card issuer might kick in the go–to APR. But if you pay on time and map out paying the debt before the offer ends, you can save hundreds of dollars.
How to choose a 0% APR offer
When it's time to choose a 0% APR offer, a number of issues come into play, including length of the offer and balance transfer fees. Here's what you need to know:

Check the length of the offer. Check how long the introductory rate (sometimes called the “intro rate” or “teaser rate”) will last. While you may think that the longer the introductory period, the better, it's actually more important to plan how much you can afford to pay each month so that you don't owe money when the offer ends.
Know your “go–to rate.” That's the rate after the introductory period. While this shouldn't be a deal-breaker, because you're going to pay in full each month (right?), it's prudent to know all the aspects of the card, including the go–to.
Ask about balance transfer fees if you plan to transfer an existing credit card balance to the new card. The fees generally run 3% to 5% of the balance transferred or $5-$10, whichever is greater. A few cards offer no balance transfer fee, such as the Chase Slate. Watch your mail: Card issuers often run special offers when they lower or waive the fees. 
Weigh other benefits, such as the 5% cash back offer of the Discover it Cashback Match, which also has a 14–month 0% intro APR on both purchases and balance transfers. Sometimes it's actually better to have a shorter offer period, because the card has benefits you'll use after the offer ends.

What is a go–to APR?
A go–to APR is the rate that kicks in once the 0% intro APR offer ends. So, if the card you've chosen offers an 18–month 0% intro APR, you have 18 months to pay for the balance, then the go–to rate kicks in. Your credit rating and your history of payments help decide what your rate will be. The better your payment history and the higher your credit rating, the lower the go–to rate.
What is the average interest rate on a credit card?
The average interest rate on credit cards varies based in part on the Federal Reserve's monthly decision on interest rates. Currently, the national average for credit cards is about 15.75%, but that can vary based on type of card. Low interest cards, of course, have the lowest average, at under 13%. Business and student cards are also low, both under 14%. The highest are instant approval, at just over 18% and bad credit, at over 23%.
That said, you should not be too concerned about a card's interest rate, because it's best to pay your card bill in full each month. It's better for your credit because FICO, the dominant credit scoring model, tracks your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of available credit you have compared to the balance that you owe. The lower the balance, the lower your ratio, which FICO loves.
What is a good interest rate on a credit card?
Rather than choose a credit card because it has a “good” interest rate, look at the card's features, because credit cards are not meant to be long–term loans.
The national average for credit card interest rates is about 15.75%. Depending on the type of card, the interest rate will vary, with low interest cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top. But that shouldn't concern you too much.
Instead, look at the 0% intro rate for balance transfers and purchases when choosing a card. Then, make sure you can pay off the debt before the go–to rate kicks in. If you know you're going to go past the intro rate period, then make sure you pay on time to improve your credit rating, because your credit rating and your on–time payments are two factors for what your go–to rate will be.
What determines the APR on a credit card?
The APR on a credit card is determined by a number of factors, including the Federal Reserve's current rate, your credit rating, the type of card you choose, and whether you have been paying on time.
The national average go–to interest rate for credit cards is about 15.75% — that's higher or lower depending on the type of card, with low interest and student cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top.
When the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark for rates, you'll typically see credit cards' rates inch up.
Your credit rating and whether you pay on time also factor into your rate; credit cards can have a range from which they assign your go–to rate.
Watch out, because you can drive your APR up by paying late or going over the limit. That can also land you with fines and even loss of the card.
How do you calculate interest on a credit card?
The easiest way to calculate interest on a credit card is with our handy–dandy calculators. You can figure out how much interest you'll owe if you pay the minimum; look at how much you need to pay on a balance transfer each month to avoid interest rates; or see how long it will take you to pay off your debt.
That said, it helps to understand how credit card issuers calculate interest. According to Discover, just divide your APR (say it's 15%) by 365 days, or .041096%. So, if you have a balance of $1,000, the daily interest rate is $0.41, which accrues each day. At the end of the month, you owe $1,013.
That may not seem like much, but it can add up quickly. If you pay the minimum on $1,000 each month (15% APR), it will take you 54 months and you will pay $370.46 in interest. Better to just pay in full each month and not put anything on your card you can't afford to buy with cash.
How do you avoid paying interest on a credit card?
It's easy to avoid paying interest on a credit card – just pay in full each month before the due date. Remember, credit cards aren't meant to be long–term lenders. They should be for building credit and convenience. You don't want to use a card for an emergency when you don't have the cash nearby, because the interest fees can overwhelm you. Instead, build an emergency fund that you can tap when the unexpected occurs, such as a broken–down car or a medical bill.
In fact, it can actually be a good idea to pay more than once a month. Just to be safe, if you pay in full several times a month, you can potentially improve your credit even more, because you don't know when issuers report to credit bureaus – pay several times a month and increase the chance of having a low balance when issuers report. (FICO, the dominant credit scoring model, bases your rating on what the credit bureaus gather about your finances.)
Here's how it works: FICO compares how much available credit you have to how much of a balance you have. The lower the ratio the better. So, if you have $10,000 available credit and you owe $1,000, your credit utilization ratio is only 10%. Owe $3,000? The ratio jumps to 30%. If you pay several times a month, you increase the chance of lowering your ratio, which is a critical part of your score.
How do you use a 0% APR credit card?
There are myriad ways to use a 0% APR credit card. From making a big purchase, such as an appliance or grill, to using it to pay down an existing balance, 0% APR cards can simplify your life. There are some things you need to know, though:
The best way to use a 0% introductory period offer is to calculate how much you can pay each month for how long. So, if you make a $3,600 purchase, and can pay $300 a month, a 12–month offer is enough for you. If you plan to use the card for a balance transfer, keep in mind that you will probably have a balance transfer fee of 3%–5%. That means you will owe $108–$180 right out of the gate. But that can be worth your while if the interest you would pay otherwise is higher than the fees.
Is using a 0% APR card a good way to build credit?
Any credit card (including a 0% APR card) that is used wisely is a good way to build credit. With a new card, you are increasing your available credit, which can be helpful for your FICO rating. Also, each month that you pay on time, your credit rating gets a little kick. And if you are diligent about paying down your debt, that will also improve your credit as the balance goes down, provided you don't incur additional debt.
That said, taking out a credit card is only good for your credit if you are responsible with it. It is the fastest way to build credit, no matter the type of card, but it can be a disaster if you let charges pile up or if you don't pay on time each month. Before committing to a new card, make sure you will use it correctly.
Can you use a 0% APR credit card to help pay off student loans?
Paying off student loans with a 0% APR credit card can be tricky. First, you might owe more than you can pay off in the maximum offer of 21 months, which means you would probably be strapped with higher interest rates than you were paying on the student loan.
Also, you will probably have a charge of 3%–5% on the total, which is another expense you may not have expected.
Finally, it is actually worth your while to hang on to the student loan, because it's an installment loan. FICO, the dominant scoring model, likes a mix of credit types, and if you have a credit card and an installment loan, that can give your credit score a little boost, provided you're paying on time.
Should I cancel my 0% interest card once I pay off the balance?
It's rare when you should cancel your 0% interest card once you pay off the balance. That's because keeping it on hand is a great way build your credit. Here's why:
Let's say you paid off $3,000 within the 15 months your 0% intro interest offer lasted. Awesome, right? Now, you're so sick of credit cards, you want to cancel the card and go all cash. But not so fast.
Here's the deal: The fastest way to build credit is to have a credit card and to pay in full and on time each month. FICO, the dominant scoring model, loves it when you do that, and you will be rewarded within months of your good habits.
Still hate credit cards and want to pay in cash? There's a way to have the best of both worlds. Keep your card account active by putting a charge on it each month that you would make any way, such as your gym membership, then pay it off before the due date. Then, use cash envelopes or whatever system you prefer to stay within budget.
Whatever you do, don't put the card in your sock drawer, because it's only a matter of time before the issuer cancels the card because it's inactive.

Choose the Right Cashback Card for You
There are few credit cards as versatile as the cashback card.
No matter your purchase habits, there's likely a cashback card for you. You can earn cash without having to think about it. You can max out rewards by pairing this kind of card with a travel rewards card, such as a Chase Freedom or Freedom Unlimited card and a Chase Sapphire Preferred. With a few cashback cards, you can even build your credit when it's not at its best while earning cash back.
Many have no annual fee. There is also the option of rotating categories or flat cashback percentages. We'll explain all that in easy-to-understand language. Here's what you need to know:
What is a cashback credit card?
A cashback credit card is a card that allows you to earn cash for making purchases. Most require good or excellent credit, which means you need at least a FICO score of 700 before you even think about applying. FICO, the credit scoring model most used by lenders, rates on a scale of 300-850, with 850 as the best.
Cashback cards are an excellent gateway card into travel cards, which can be more complicated to maneuver and typically have an annual fee. Because cashback cards often don’t have annual fees, you don’t have to worry about a minimum spend to make the card worth your while.
Once you’ve built your credit, pick out a cashback card and practice good money-management habits with it. That means keep a budget, plan what you’ll use your card for (only spend what you have the money to repay), and pay in full and on time each month.
After you’ve successfully managed your cashback card for about a year, then it’s time to look at possibly upgrading to a travel or rewards card for more intense benefits.
Why use cashback credit cards?
You may be wondering why you should use a cashback credit card. If you can pay your balance in full and on time each month, you can earn cash back in the hundreds each year. Say you have a card that pays 2% back on everything, and there is no annual fee. If you spend $1,000 a month for a year, you will get $240 back at the end of that year. 
Also, by paying in full and on time each month, you will improve your credit, because FICO, the dominant scoring model, loves it when you don't carry a balance on your credit cards, and it really loves when you pay on time.
How do I get a cashback credit card?
When you apply for a cashback credit card, the card issuer will gather some information, including Social Security number, name and address, and income. Fill out the form honestly, because you can have the card revoked if you’re caught in a lie. Income can be money you have access to, rather than just your salary, so if you and your spouse are employed, you can combine the incomes. This is helpful if you are an at-home parent and the family has just one income.
Many cards will approve or decline you within minutes. If you are approved, you may be able to shop online with your new account. Your card will arrive within a few days in the mail.
How do cashback credit cards work?
Cashback credit cards work in a variety of ways, usually offering a percentage back for your purchases.
Say you have a Wells Fargo Cash Wise card, which gives 1.5% back on everything. That means if you spend $1,000 a month on groceries, gas and other expenses, at year end, you'll earn $180 back. And because many cashback cards don't have annual fees, you're not having to clear that “fee hurdle.”
Some cashback cards are a little more complicated. They might pay for quarterly categories, for example, such as the Discover it Cashback Match. Categories can have reward limits -- for example, the Cashback Match gives you 5% back for up to $1,500 a quarter. Categories can include wholesale clubs, restaurants, gas and more. The advantage with a card that has quarterly categories is that you get a higher reward. However, there are usually signups, limits and you have to keep track of which categories qualify.
Depending on the card, cash back can be in the form of credit statements, bank deposit, checks, even merchandise through shopping portals. For example, Discover Deals allows you to get cashback bonuses or money off your purchases. Through these shopping portals, you can shop for clothing, gifts, health and beauty aids, travel and more. Some cards, such as the Wells Fargo Propel, allow you to redeem for gift cards.
What are signup bonuses on cashback cards?
Many cashback cards offer a signup bonus, typically between $100 and $200, with a required spend within a certain amount of time, usually 90 days or 3 months.
The required spend is usually below that of a travel card, typically $1,000 or less. This makes it easier to meet the requirements and earn the cash bonus. For example, the Chase Freedom Unlimited offers $150 after a $500 spend within your first 3 months of card membership.
Make sure you have the cash to pay back the required spend, because if you carry the charge over month-to-month, you basically undo the benefit of the bonus by paying interest fees.
How do you use a cashback credit card to save money?
Using a cashback card to save money only works if you use your card for purchases you plan to make anyway and if you pay your card bill in full and on time each month. That way, you avoid late fees and interest charges. You also want to make sure that your planned spending will put your cash back above any annual fee. So, if you have an annual fee of $95, and the redemption is at 2% on every dollar spent, you want to make sure you plan to spend at least $4,750 in a year.
Ideally, you want to focus on your best cashback, travel or rewards card, and put as many purchases as possible on it so that you earn maximum miles.
How do you strategically use a cashback credit card?
7 strategies to maximize cashback rewards:

Research thoroughly before choosing your card. Read the fine print.
When choosing a card, assess what kind of card it is, whether it has a flat cashback rate or rotating categories. If you like the opportunity to earn as much as 10% back on select categories your first year, then a rotating card might be a good choice. Just make sure you are willing to do the quarterly signups and keep track of the categories. If not, a flat rate card may be best. This way, you can earn up to 2% back on everything.
Make it your go-to card. See if you can pay your rent, insurance and utilities with it, but make sure there are no additional charges. Buy your groceries with it.
Don’t spend just to earn cash back. Only use it to buy what you were going to purchase anyway.
If you can’t pay it off in full each month, there’s no point in acquiring it. The interest fees will overshadow any cash back you’ve earned.
Never go over the limit or pay late. These are wasted dollars.
Use shopping portals. Frequently check for deals.

What do you look for in a cashback credit card?
Here are 4 things to look for in a cashback credit card:

Is it flexible enough for your needs? There’s no point in taking out a card if you’ll never use it.
Is there an annual fee? Will you earn more cash back than the cost of the annual fee? This is a deal breaker.
Will you use it without overspending? Never carry over a charge from month to month. If you aren’t sure, it might be best to choose a credit-builder card and put a small charge on it each month, paying in full before the due date.
Do you want a card with a shopping portal? This is a great way to save some money.

Why do creditors offer cashback cards?
On the surface, it doesn't make sense why creditors or credit card issuers offer cashback credit cards. Used correctly, you can get hundreds of dollars back each year. But it makes sense, once you understand the issuer business model. Here's how it works:

Card issuers charge fees such as late payment fees, annual fees, balance transfer fees and cash advance fees. For example, when you transfer a balance to your new card, you are usually charged a 3%-5% fee or $5-$10, whichever is greater. Even if the card offers a 0% intro APR, and you pay your balance by the time the offer ends, the bank still gets a take.
Card issuers, as you probably know, benefit from interest fees you pay when you carry a balance past a month. These fees are hefty, with the average APR running at about 15%. If you make a $500 purchase and your APR is 17%, a monthly minimum payment will mean that you pay for 24 months and pay $92 in interest. Great for the issuer, not so amazing for you. That's why it's important not to carry a balance, or you'll wash away the earnings you've made with your cashback card.
Card issuers and networks earn a processing fee for each transaction that is typically paid by the merchant. Called interchange fees, they are based on the volume and value of transactions. Usually, the consumer is not impacted by this fee, which can be a percentage of the transaction of say, about 2%, plus a flat fee of perhaps $0.10 per transaction, although there can be what is called a checkout fee that the consumer pays.

With all these fees floating around, what do you do? First off, pay in full and on time each month. That will keep you from paying late fees and interest fees. Also, keep an emergency fund so you won't be tempted to take out a cash advance. Finally, ask the merchant if you are being charged a checkout fee for using your Visa or MasterCard. If so and it's a big purchase, you may want to think about shopping elsewhere.
What are typical cashback rates?
There is no typical cashback rate. Cards can pay out a flat 1.5% or 2% or they can give a higher rate for specific types of purchases. For example, the Blue Cash Everyday offers 3% back on purchases made at U.S. supermarkets for up to $6,000 a year. (It's 1% after that.) That comes to $180 back. Terms apply.
Some cards, such as the Chase Freedom, pay out for categories that you sign up for each quarter. The Freedom, for example, offers 5% back on quarterly categories for up to $1,500 spend, or $75 back each quarter.
How to compare cashback credit cards
Here's how to compare cashback credit cards:
Track your spending for 2 months. You'll want to see how much you spend on items such as groceries and gas. Also, look at how much you spend at specific stores, such as Sam's Club or Amazon.com.
Study a mix of cashback cards, including Discover it Cashback Match, Blue Cash Preferred and Chase Freedom Unlimited. Each has a specific type of model: The Cashback Match offers quarterly categories (as does the Chase Freedom); Blue Cash Preferred offers yearlong rewards for specific categories; and the Chase Freedom Unlimited (as well as the Wells Fargo Cash Wise) offers a percentage for all purchases.
If Amazon is a go-to for you, the Cashback Match may be a good choice for you. If you have a family and spend a lot on groceries, the Blue Cash Preferred can be a good option. And if you don't want to be pinned down by what you use your card for, the Cash Wise might be the one to choose.
What are rotating categories?
Cards with rotating categories usually give you a higher percentage back than other cards, but only for a quarter. Categories can be restaurants, groceries, gas and more. In the last year, Amazon.com and warehouse clubs have increased in popularity.
You usually have to sign up each quarter, but if you don't mind tracking which categories you'll use each month, you can get as much as 10% back at the end of your first year. One thing, there is usually a limit to how much you can spend toward the quarter, typically $1,500 a quarter. After that it's 1%.
An alternative is the flat rate, which gives you the same amount back regardless of the purchase. The amount is usually 1.5%-2% back. So, if you get 2% back on everything, it doesn't matter what you are using your card for — groceries, clothes shopping, whatever. If you spend $1,000 a month with your card, you get $240 back at the end of your year. And there is no maximum spend.
What are common cashback categories?
There’s no guarantee, and categories change from year to year, but here are common cashback categories:

Restaurants
The Cashback Match is generous with this category, as is the Chase Freedom. This is a good category for the millennial to target if your evenings center around trying out new restaurants or during the workweek checking out the latest lunch spot.
Amazon.com
Do a lot of shopping online? The Cashback Match has featured this category, giving you 5% back on Amazon shopping for up to $1,500 in the selected quarter, up to $75 back -- $150 back at the end of your first year.
Wholesale clubs
This is an increasingly popular category for cashback cards, sometimes as a quarterly category and sometimes in a limited time offer.
Grocery stores
Groceries are a favorite category for cashback cards. In addition, during the quarter when grocery stores were featured, Chase Freedom included drugstores. If you shop for a family, this can be a good category — with the Discover it Cashback Match, for example, you can spend $500 a month on groceries and max out the spend, giving you back $75 for that quarter. And don't forget the additional $75 back at the end of your first year.
Transportation
Some cards give a higher percent for gas, such as the Blue Cash Preferred. Others, such as the Chase Freedom, also give 5% back during specific quarters on parking, tolls and Amtrak purchases. This category is a good choice for the daily commuter or if you do a whole lot of shuttling the kids and the soccer team.

Advantages for cashback credit cards
Cashback credit cards have a number of advantages, including:
A cashback card gives you, well, cash back, sometimes hundreds of dollars a year. If you use it strategically as your card of choice, you can enjoy not only statement credits, but shopping deals as well, depending on the card. By using the card for everything from grocery shopping to furniture purchases, the cash back can add up. Just don’t make purchases you don’t have the money to pay back – remember, a credit card isn’t designed to be a long-term loan.
Another, lesser-known advantage is that cashback cards can be great practice for a travel or rewards card. These cards typically have an annual fee, which you have to factor in when calculating how much money you need to spend in a year to make the card worth your while. Also, travel cards can require some maneuvering to make it worth your while, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred’s Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. The portal is an excellent way to maximize your points, but it’s a bit more complicated than just spending and getting your periodic statement credit.
Cashback cards also offer variety in structure. If you want something simple and straightforward, you can get a flat-rate card, such as the Wells Fargo Cash Wise. Want to maximize cash back? The Discover it Cashback Match is a great choice. There are also cards that are a mix of the two – such as the Blue Cash Preferred and the Blue Cash Everyday. These cards give you extra cash back for specific categories year-round, plus a minimum cash back for everything else.
Disadvantages to cashback credit cards
From incurring additional debt to impacted credit, there can be disadvantages to cashback credit cards, none of which are insurmountable.
On the plus side, you can earn cash back for using your cashback card. On the downside, you can end up owing more than you can pay off or even harming your credit. Here are possible disadvantages to cashback cards and what you can do about them:

Annual Fee
    A few cashback cards carry an annual fee. While that isn't necessarily a drawback, you want to plan out the use of your new card to make sure you will benefit in the long run if it has an annual fee. Say your card has an annual fee of $95 and you get 6% back on groceries for up to $6,000 spend a year. That means you want to make sure you will spend at least $1,600 for the year on your card for groceries, assuming you don't buy anything else. If you spend $500 a month on groceries, or $6,000 for the year, that means you'll get back $360, or $265 after you pay the annual fee. Bottom line: Make sure you know if you will earn more cash back than needed to pay the annual fee.
Carrying a Balance
    Carrying a balance can be a detriment to cashback cards. Here's why: Say you have a $3,000 balance on your card, but you can only pay the minimum. That means if the card's APR is 17%, it will take you 126 months and you will pay $2,241 in interest fees. If you spend $6,000 a year on your card, even if you are paying it off as you go, but still are paying the minimum on that $3,000, your cash back will be little more than the expense of fees, because of that annual fee of $95. In 10 years, you can earn $3,600 back on groceries, but the annual fee comes to $950. So you have spent $2,241 on interest fees and $950 in annual fees, meaning that you've spent most of your cash back on fees. Bottom line: Don't incur a balance on your cashback card. Only use the card for expenses you can pay back at the end of the month.
Late Payments
    It can be tempting to use your cashback card with wild abandon because of the benefits earned. But never spend more than you can afford, and pay in full and on time each month. Why? Because if you are late on your account, that is reported to the credit bureaus, and ultimately, it is reflected on your credit score. In fact, history of on-time payments is the most important aspect of your FICO credit rating, making up 35% of your score. (FICO is the scoring model most used by lenders.) Bottom line: Pay in full and on time each month to maximize your cash back and to build your credit.

How do you redeem cash rewards?
You can redeem cash rewards a number of ways, depending on the card. In most cases, you get a statement credit, but some issuers allow you to spend your cash back on shopping or gift cards. In some cases, you can deposit the cash back in a bank account or get a check cut. Issuers might give a better deal for the statement credit, though, so check. Some Bank of America cards give you 10% back when you deposit your credit in a Bank of America checking or savings account. If you have a preferred account, your cash back for deposits increases to 25% and even up to 75%.
What is a statement credit?
Most cashback credit cards give you your cash in what's called a statement credit. That means that on your monthly statement, you'll see a positive balance that you can use toward your monthly bill. Some issuers also allow you to deposit your cash back into a bank account or even get a check cut, however, there can be financial incentives to opt for a statement credit. Some issuers, such as Bank of America, give you incentives to deposit your cash back into a checking or saving account held with that bank. Others give you the option of using your cash back toward an online shopping portal.
Are there limitations on where I can spend my cashback rewards?
There can be limitations on where you can spend your cashback rewards, because issuers have different rules for how you can get your cash back. You usually get your cash through statement credits, but some issuers offer you the option to park your cash in a savings or checking account (you can get a 10% bonus when you do this with your BankAmericard Cash Rewards, provided it's a Bank of America account), while other issuers allow you to redeem with gift cards, such as the Barclaycard CashForward.
Some issuers, such as Discover, also have portals where you can shop with your cash back while getting discounts on goods and gift cards.
Are cashback rewards taxable as income?
Cashback rewards are usually not taxable as income; they are typically considered a discount by the IRS. The same is true of rewards points and miles.
“However, there may be times when you need to reduce the amount of a [business] deduction to reflect the discount that a cash back reward provides you with,” says TurboTax.
TurboTax gives the example of when you are self-employed and you purchase a cellphone that you only use for business. Although your phone is deductible on your taxes, TurboTax points out that you can only deduct your actual cost. So, if you get a $150 rebate for your $200 phone, you really only paid $50 for the phone, and that's how much you can deduct.
How can I maximize my cashback rewards?
There are a number of ways you can maximize your cashback rewards. It starts with choosing your card.

Make a list of your spending habits for a month. Write everything! Then, categorize by type of store — grocery stores, gas stations, wholesale clubs, Amazon.com, restaurants.
Do you see a pattern? If you are spending a lot on groceries, you might want the Blue Cash Preferred. If you spend a fair amount on a mix, such as wholesale clubs and Amazon.com, the Cashback Match may be a good choice. And if your shopping is truly eclectic, or you don't want to get strapped to categories, you'll want to look at a fixed-rate card, such as the Cash Wise.
Look at ways to put charges on the card that you make anyway. Check if you can charge your rent, insurance and utilities, for example.
Figure out how much you will be spending on your card, if this is your go-to card. Just make sure you have it in your budget to pay off the card in full and on time each month.
Don't apply for multiple cards at once. That can sabotage your credit. Pick a card, looking at the annual fee, and any other benefits, such as balance transfer offers. Also, make sure you will earn more than the annual fee.
Some cards, such as the Freedom cards, can be paired with other cards to maximize rewards. For example, you can pair the Freedom products with the Chase Sapphire Preferred, allowing you to fully maximize the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal for travel.

Is a cashback card right for me?
If you’re wondering whether a cashback card is right for you, ask yourself these 4 questions:
What is your FICO score? If it is below 700 on a scale of 300-850, don’t bother to apply except in a few cases. In some cases, a score higher than 750 is required, so do your research. Check your credit at MyFICO.com. If it’s below 700, take out one of your free credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com and check it for accuracy. Get the credit bureau to correct any inaccuracies, and consider getting a credit-builder card to build your credit. Within months, you’ll see a difference.
Do you have a budget? This is a must to ensure you don’t go over on your spending. You’ll want to only spend on your card what you already have in the bank. Credit cards are for credit building, convenience, and in this case, cash back, not to be used as a long-term loan.
Do you pay your bills on time? If you have any trouble paying your bills on time, having a credit card can be problematic. That’s because you can face late fees and hurt your credit. Instead of a card with rewards or cash back, which takes a little organization, see if you can get a credit-builder card to practice on.
Are you intrigued by travel and rewards cards, but not sure if you have the organizational skills to manage them? A cashback cards might be a good choice. If you choose a simple, flat-rate cashback card, you can use it and forget it. It gives you the opportunity to earn money back while focusing on spending and paying the monthly bill. If you want something that gives you a little more in rewards and practice tracking your spending, choose one with quarterly categories or category spending limits.

I'm wanting a card that will give me cash back or points(not sure how it works) mainly for airplane tickets, (I like Southwest Airlines the best)I want to be able to use the card on any purchase. I have great credit. We are wanting to eventually pay for all the tickets for my family to go on vacation. Which would be the best card?

The are a number of travel rewards credit cards that might be a good fit for you. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one great option because you can transfer the points you earn with this card directly to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account. A few other good choices for flexible travel rewards would be the Discover It Miles, Capital One Venture or BankAmericard Travel Rewards.

Which card is best for my daughter who wants to earn free airfare from NC to maui, and possibly asia.  We need to be able to earn this airfare quickly, as her trip is this september.  I have excellent credit, and I want to earn the most miles possible (even if we have to spend some money on the card).  As long as it's free the first year, it's fine.

The Capital One Venture and the Barclaycard Arrival Plus would both be great options for your situation. Both of these cards come with big sign up bonuses and offer flexible travel rewards!

One great choice for your situation would be the Discover It Cashback Match. This card comes with an extra long intro APR that would help you finance your home remodel interest free and there is also an excellent cash back rewards program so you can earn rewards on all of your purchases.

I'm retired but with a secure income and top rated credit.  I also pay off my balance every month.  What's the best cash back card for someone who spends about $1400 a month?

Picking the best cash back card for you will depend on how you spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express and BankAmericard Cash Rewards would both be excellent options as they offer bonus cash back on certain purchases. But if you would prefer and credit cards with a consistently high rewards rate on all purchases, the Citi Double Cash would be a great choice.

If you have no credit, you will probably need to start with a secured credit card. Secured cards work just like normal credit cards, but you have to put down a refundable security deposit to get approved. After a year or so of responsible use, you will have built up your credit enough to get approved to a standard, unsecured credit card. The Capital One Secured MasterCard and the Discover it Secured Credit Card are both great options.

Hello,
Right now I have a $5,000 dollar balance on a card with a 20.65% APR. and an annual fee that is billed monthly $3. I have a 732 Credit score and want to look in to a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR so I can get a more manageable credit card debt. Which card would you recommend?

The Chase slate card doesn't have the frills or points, but it is an excellent balance transfer card.

Must have extensive dental work. I am looking for a new card just for this. I would like no interest for max. months. Would the dental work be considered a purchase? The dentist doesn't offer terms. I have excellent credit-mid 800's. Cash back would be great, but not necessary.

If the merchant will allow you to pay with a credit card then the transaction should be considered a purchase. If you're looking for the longest possible intro APR, consider the Citi Simplicity or the Citi Diamond Preferred. These cards don't offer cash back, so if you'd like cash back plus a long intro period check out the Discover It Cashback Match.

Deciding which rewards card is best may vary based on how you usually spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express  is probably your best choice. But if you're simply looking for a credit card with a great flat rewards rate on every purchase, the Citi Double Cash is an excellent option.

I have Capital One Venture One and an American Express Centurion.  I do a lot of international travel and own my own business.   Capital One Venture One is my choice for small purchases.  Centurion for everything else since I MUST spend over $250,000 annually.

	0% Credit Cards & Interest Free Credit Cards

	Low interest rate (or 0%) credit cards can save you hundreds of dollars on balance transfers and on routine purchases carried over as credit card balances. Or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management. Whatever your goals or motivation, zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit. You can find out more about credit score here.

	Keep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards, namely those that offer a Variable APR and those that give you a Fixed APR.  Just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages, a fixed rate APR will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan. If your card company decides to raise it – which is somewhat rare – they will first notify you of that change according to Federal law requirements. With a variable rate, your APR is tied to a prevailing rate such as the Prime Interest Rate. If the prime rate increases then your APR will most likely follow in a similar fashion.

	Generally speaking, credit card companies and banks will extend either 6 or 21 month offers – within the 0% to 3.99% annual interest rate range. That can generate a considerable discount when normal APRs are averaging around 15% or higher. Once the introductory promotional period expires, the APR on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate. Of course the ideal balance is a credit card that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive, competitively priced low interest rate for the long term.

	The interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card. That’s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases. That’s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon, no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be.

I'm wanting a card that will give me cash back or points(not sure how it works) mainly for airplane tickets, (I like Southwest Airlines the best)I want to be able to use the card on any purchase. I have great credit. We are wanting to eventually pay for all the tickets for my family to go on vacation. Which would be the best card?

The are a number of travel rewards credit cards that might be a good fit for you. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one great option because you can transfer the points you earn with this card directly to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account. A few other good choices for flexible travel rewards would be the Discover It Miles, Capital One Venture or BankAmericard Travel Rewards.

Which card is best for my daughter who wants to earn free airfare from NC to maui, and possibly asia.  We need to be able to earn this airfare quickly, as her trip is this september.  I have excellent credit, and I want to earn the most miles possible (even if we have to spend some money on the card).  As long as it's free the first year, it's fine.

The Capital One Venture and the Barclaycard Arrival Plus would both be great options for your situation. Both of these cards come with big sign up bonuses and offer flexible travel rewards!

One great choice for your situation would be the Discover It Cashback Match. This card comes with an extra long intro APR that would help you finance your home remodel interest free and there is also an excellent cash back rewards program so you can earn rewards on all of your purchases.

I'm retired but with a secure income and top rated credit.  I also pay off my balance every month.  What's the best cash back card for someone who spends about $1400 a month?

Picking the best cash back card for you will depend on how you spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express and BankAmericard Cash Rewards would both be excellent options as they offer bonus cash back on certain purchases. But if you would prefer and credit cards with a consistently high rewards rate on all purchases, the Citi Double Cash would be a great choice.

If you have no credit, you will probably need to start with a secured credit card. Secured cards work just like normal credit cards, but you have to put down a refundable security deposit to get approved. After a year or so of responsible use, you will have built up your credit enough to get approved to a standard, unsecured credit card. The Capital One Secured MasterCard and the Discover it Secured Credit Card are both great options.

Hello,
Right now I have a $5,000 dollar balance on a card with a 20.65% APR. and an annual fee that is billed monthly $3. I have a 732 Credit score and want to look in to a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR so I can get a more manageable credit card debt. Which card would you recommend?

There are a number of great balance transfer offers that may be a good option for you. Check out our balance transfer credit cards page to see all the best options! There are cards with no intro balance transfer fee and others with 0% intro APR for up to 21 months!

The Chase slate card doesn't have the frills or points, but it is an excellent balance transfer card.

Must have extensive dental work. I am looking for a new card just for this. I would like no interest for max. months. Would the dental work be considered a purchase? The dentist doesn't offer terms. I have excellent credit-mid 800's. Cash back would be great, but not necessary.

If the merchant will allow you to pay with a credit card then the transaction should be considered a purchase. If you're looking for the longest possible intro APR, consider the Citi Simplicity or the Citi Diamond Preferred. These cards don't offer cash back, so if you'd like cash back plus a long intro period check out the Discover It Cashback Match.

Deciding which rewards card is best may vary based on how you usually spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express  is probably your best choice. But if you're simply looking for a credit card with a great flat rewards rate on every purchase, the Citi Double Cash is an excellent option.

We applied for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card last year and it has become the best credit card that I have ever owned. Customer service is first class and you speak to a person when you call. I redeemed miles for a trip recently and though I could not get the exact departure date, the day earlier worked fine. When I try to book with another card on American, I can never get the dates that I want or I have to use extra miles. It became so frustrating and now I can say, I have found THE CARD that works for us.

If you're interested in travel rewards, the Discover It Miles or the Chase Sapphire Preferred are both excellent options as the offer generous rewards rates and flexible redemption options.

The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one of the most popular travel rewards cards on the market, and for good reason! This card comes with one of the best sign up bonuses available and the point you earn can be redeemed in a number of ways to make sure you always get great bang for your buck.

I am most interested in international travel and am searching for a CC I can use as a business credit card (law practice) with the most airline travel benefit for my preferred locations. Have been considering Chase Ink Preferred. Any helpful thoughts?

The Ink Business Preferred Credit Card is certainly one of the best options for a business credit card with travel rewards. It offers one of the best sign up bonuses available and a very flexible travel rewards program. Another card to consider is the Capital One Spark Miles for Business.

Do you earn miles or travel rewards on any card for a balance transfer or only on new purchases?

Credit cards generally only offer rewards on net purchases (purchases minus returns). Transactions like balance transfers or cash advances will not earn rewards.

The Capital One Venture is an excellent credit card if you're looking for the most flexibile travel rewards. You earn double miles with every purchase and miles can be redeemed at any airline or hotel with no blackout dates!

The The Platinum Card from American Express offers complimentary access to their luxurious Centurian Lounges whenever you have a flight that same day. Another great option is the Citi Prestige which offers complimentary Priority Pass  membership as long as you carry the card!

	Choose the best travel credit card

	Those who travel by air – plus anyone who would like to be able to fly by getting free or discounted airfares by using their credit cards – are perfect candidates for airline credit cards. These are essentially awards or reward credit cards that let the cardholder rack up airline miles, points, or similar value which can then be converted into a free ticket to fly to a favorite destination.

	The best airline credit cards will often provide special features and amenities in addition to the free miles that are especially tailored to the needs and preferences of air travelers. Other travel rewards include free tickets for a fellow passenger, preferential rates on hotels and rental cars, double rewards points for dining, entertaining, and coupons that provide access to airline VIP lounges inside airports.

	Most airline credit cards have interest rates comparable to other credit cards, but many charge an annual fee that might range anywhere from $49-$125. You should examine the pros and cons of each card, comparing their benefits and features against their fees to calculate which one is the best fit and offers the most flexibility at the best price. Be sure to keep in mind that while some of these cards let you transfer your points or accumulated rewards to any airline, others restrict you to one or two specific air carriers. Your free miles might have a "catch" to them. Choose a flexible card that lets you apply your awards to any air carrier or one that will help you earn airline miles and perks on the flight that you use most of the time for personal travel or for business rewards.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Welcome to the World of Travel Cards
Every day, a new credit card seems to launch, with travel and cashback cards taking the lead. Similar in many ways, travel cards can be thought of as the “adult” card, because the miles or points can be quite valuable, and there’s a little more thought to making them work, in part because there can be an annual fee to leverage (more on that later).
Travel cards offer a twofold bonus. First, you can use them to maximize the returns on your travel spending, saving you hundreds of dollars a year. Second, some offer special access to travel rewards, such as free nights in swanky hotels, access to exclusive airport lounges and more. Not only can travel cards benefit those who work around the world or who often travel for pleasure, they can reap great rewards for the occasional traveler. Just think – earn statement credits for a weekend getaway or a quick trip out of town. Here’s what you need to know to find the best one:

General rewards rate
Travel rewards cards offer rewards as a points system, where the points have a certain cash value applicable toward travel spending. Often, these cards refer to points as miles. They are pretty much the same thing, although the values can vary, going above $0.02 and below $0.01 for every point or mile earned.
When earning, you can get up to $0.03 for every dollar spent for a specific category, such as restaurants or worldwide travel. Others will offer a flat 2:1 miles-per-dollar ratio on all purchases. Take stock of how much you spend, on average, for categories like restaurants, gas and yes, even airfare to decide which kind of travel card works best for you. 
Certain Chase cards will increase the rewards rate if you redeem them through their travel purchase portal.  You can also often redeem for clothing, electronics and other goods with many cards’ miles, although you may not get as good of a rate of exchange.
Sign-up bonus
Besides the general rewards plan, you should closely examine the sign-up bonus when deciding on a travel rewards card. You will have to meet a minimum spend requirement in the first few months, so know your budget going in, to ensure you can meet the goal. Make sure you have the money to pay it back in full and on time so you don’t incur interest fees, otherwise, you have defeated the purpose of getting a bonus.
Airline-specific perks
Airline-specific cards can offer unique perks, such as free checked bags, priority boarding or lounge access. If you have a loyalty to a certain airline, the right rewards rate combined with these perks may make them a superior deal compared to more general travel cards. 
Transfer partnerships
Some travel cards have partnerships with specific hotel and airline rewards programs, sometimes with a 1:1 ratio. So, even if you have a co-branded card, you might be able to use your miles on other brands. 
Fine print and fees
Certain offers come with blackout dates in which you can’t apply your miles to reservations for certain flights or nights in a hotel. They’re usually reserved for heavily trafficked times, such as holidays or days near major events. Again, having a plan comes in handy. Do you require fuss-free redemptions? Or do you travel enough during off-peak times that blackout dates won’t bother you?
Also, pay attention to expiration dates. Your miles can expire if you don’t use them by a certain deadline. Others  allow you to keep your miles as long as your account is active.
Some cards may require you to book through an airline’s website in order to apply your points to the cost of your flight.
Finally, some travel cards will offer a certain reimbursement amount if your trip is delayed. They can also have trip insurance, lost luggage reimbursement and other benefits.
Be mindful of annual fees. You’ll want to make sure you will use the card enough to offset an annual fee.  Also, cards specific to a hotel or airline may offset the annual fee cost with certain perks, like one free night’s stay or free flight every year you keep your account open. Many cards waive the fee for the first year.

Want more information?
Below are a variety of frequently asked questions and answers regarding travel rewards and programs. You can also read our detailed reviews of travel credit cards once you have narrowed your choices down to a few cards. The reviews can help you confirm which offer fits your needs. If you’re homing in on a card for a specific airline or hotel, we have reviews for those, too.
What is a travel credit card?
A travel credit card can reward you for travel behavior, such as eating at restaurants or staying at hotels. Some are loyalty cards in which you benefit from using specific hotel or airline brands. Others, such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, have an open-ended reward and redemption system that allows you to redeem for all manner of travel expenses.
Travel cards are an excellent way to get reimbursed for vacations, make purchases on shopping portals, gain access to airport lounges, get free baggage checks and more. Today, there is a huge selection of travel cards, so it’s important to shop around and pick the one that’s best for your lifestyle.
What are airline miles?
Airline miles were originally designed for airline loyalty programs in which you got credit in the way of “miles” for your spending on a card. Today, miles cards sometimes are not attached to a specific airline, such as Discover it Miles, or a card may have partnerships with a variety of airlines, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred.
There are also hotel travel cards, which will typically refer to the benefits as “points.” Whether called points or miles, these benefits can earn you savings in the hundreds each year. By putting miles toward flights or points toward hotel stays, you can get a statement credit for vacation expenses and more.
How do I get a travel credit card?
When you apply for a travel credit card, the card issuer will gather some information, including Social Security number, name and address, and income. Fill out the form honestly, because you can have the card revoked if you’re caught in a lie. Income can be money you have access to, rather than just your salary, so if you and your spouse are employed, you can combine the incomes. This is helpful if you are an at-home parent and the family has just one income.
Many cards will approve or decline you within minutes. If you are approved, you may be able to shop online with your new account. Your card will arrive within a few days in the mail.
How to compare travel credit cards
Here's how to compare travel credit cards:
Track your spending for 2 months. You'll want to see how much you spend on items such as groceries and gas.
Study a mix of travel cards, including Chase Sapphire Preferred, Delta Gold from American Express and Barclaycard Arrival Plus. Each has a specific type of model: The Sapphire Preferred offers a vast variety of partnerships with airlines and hotels; the Delta Gold rewards you for spending at a specific brand; and the Arrival Plus is a good choice for general travel.
Compare the signup bonuses and decide if you can afford the required spend. Also, look at the annual fees and compare to the benefits your receive, such as free baggage checks, miles earned, and rental car insurance.
Why do creditors offer travel cards?
On the surface, it doesn't make sense why creditors or credit card issuers offer travel credit cards.  But it makes sense, once you understand the issuer business model. Here's how it works:

Card issuers charge fees such as late payment fees, annual fees, balance transfer fees and cash advance fees. For example, when you transfer a balance to your new card, you are usually charged a 3%-5% fee or $5-$10, whichever is greater. Even if the card offers a 0% intro APR, and you pay your balance by the time the offer ends, the bank still gets a take.
Card issuers, as you probably know, benefit from interest fees you pay when you carry a balance past a month. These fees are hefty, with the average APR running at about 15%. If you make a $500 purchase and your APR is 17%, a monthly minimum payment will mean that you pay for 24 months and pay $92 in interest. Great for the issuer, not so amazing for you. That's why it's important not to carry a balance, or you'll wash away the earnings you've made with your travel card.
Card issuers and networks earn a processing fee for each transaction that is typically paid by the merchant. Called interchange fees, they are based on the volume and value of transactions. Usually, the consumer is not impacted by this fee, which can be a percentage of the transaction of say, about 2%, plus a flat fee of perhaps $0.10 per transaction. That said, you can be charged a “checkout fee” for using your card.

With all these fees floating around, what do you do? First off, pay in full and on time each month. That will keep you from paying late fees and interest fees. Also, keep an emergency fund so you won't be tempted to take out a cash advance. Finally, ask the merchant if you are being charged a checkout fee for using your Visa or MasterCard. If so and it's a big purchase, you may want to think about shopping elsewhere.
What are the advantages of a travel credit card?
Travel cards have a number of advantages, including the ability to earn statement credits for travel and sometimes luxury benefits, such as access to airport lounges.
If you are loyal to a specific hotel or airline brand, you can earn double miles for spending on that brand and even earn stays and other loyalty benefits. Some cards, such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, allows you to earn 2X miles on everything, then you can earn a statement credit on travel purchases of your choosing. This allows you to shop around for the best hotel, airline, limousine service, condo, rental car, and so on. Add to that, your miles don’t expire, although there can be a deadline for redeeming a specific purchase.
What are the disadvantages of a travel credit card?
There are a few disavantages to travel cards, but nothing that can’t be overcome.
As you know, travel cards can have an annual fee, but that doesn’t have to be a disadvantage. Simply make sure you will spend enough to cover the fee. If, for example, you have a $59 annual fee and you get 2X miles on every purchase, you’ll need to spend a minimum of $3,000 throughout the year to get 6,000 miles, which is enough to cover the annual fee.
Another challenge, and this is true for all credit cards, is that you can incur interest fees if you carry over a balance. There’s an easy answer, though. Just don’t charge anything you don’t already have the money to cover, and pay in full and on time each month.
How do frequent flyer credit cards work?
Frequent flyer credit cards reward you more for airline-related expenses including baggage checks, tickets, and food and drink. The higher end cards might also gain you access to such benefits as brand-specific airport lounges. The more you use the card on airline expenses, the more you benefit with miles that can be redeemed for flights.
Heads up that frequent flyer miles can expire, so read the fine print. Also, there can be blackout dates, so before taking out a card, make sure it’s a product you’ll use based on your current habits. Do you only travel for the holidays? Do you not really have an interest in airport lounges? That will impact the card you apply for.
How do you use your airline miles?
Cards vary widely when it comes to using your airline miles. Some cards offer a portal that allows you to redeem for qualified packages, flights, hotels and condos, and more, such as the Barclaycard Arrival Plus. The Arrival Plus allows you to redeem on any qualifying travel expense through a card portal that tracks how many points you need to redeem an item and how much more time you have to redeem for each item. Others limit how you use the miles to specific brands. For example, the American Express Delta cards’ miles can be specifically used for Delta flights and other Delta expenses.
What are bonus miles?
Many travel cards offer a signup bonus in which you spend a certain amount on your card within a certain period of time, usually 3 months or 90 days, in exchange for a one-time bulk of miles or points. Some cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred, also give you points for behaviors such as signing up your first authorized user within a certain amount of time. You typically have to be a new cardholder.
While the bonus miles are a great draw for the new cardholder, there are a couple of things you want to make sure about before signing up. First, do you have the cash on hand to pay back the purchases you make to qualify for the bonus? You’ll want to be able to pay it back by the due date of that month, or you’ll incur interest charges, which basically would defeat the purpose of the bonus miles. Remember, a credit card is not designed to be a long-term loan.
Second, are you going to use the card enough to make the annual fee worth your while? Calculate how many miles you need to make up for the fee, even if the fee is waived the first year, because you want to consider a card to be a financial product for the long haul. Why? Because the longer you keep a card and treat it well, the better it is for your credit.
How many miles does it take to get a free flight?
Miles redemptions for a flight vary widely, and it depends on the type of ticket you want (ie. First class) and when and where you travel, but for example, on an Oct. 28, 2016, Delta flight from LAX to JFK (main cabin), it would have run you 25,000 miles.
Miles can also be used to upgrade your seat, purchase a companion’s ticket or buy refreshments. Miles often don’t expire (read the fine print), so it can be worth your while to save up for a big trip. Just double down on paying for things you would buy anyway to earn those miles. Sometimes you can pay rent, car insurance and utilities with your credit card. Just make sure there are no fees for those charges.
How do you use a travel credit card to save money?
Using a travel card to save money only works if you use your card for purchases you plan to make anyway and if you pay your card bill in full and on time each month. That way, you avoid late fees and interest charges. You also want to make sure that your planned spending will put your miles or points above the annual fee. So, if you have an annual fee of $95, and the redemption is at $0.01 for every mile, you want to make sure you plan to earn at least 9,500 miles or points in a year.
Ideally, you want to focus on your best travel or rewards card, and put as many purchases as possible on it so that you earn maximum miles.
What do you need to consider before getting an airline credit card?
4 things to consider before getting an airline credit card:

Are you going to earn more points or miles than the value of the annual fee? This can be a deal-breaker, because there is no point is taking out a card that you won’t be using to the fullest extent.
Will you be able to pay off the balance each month and on time? Again, you don’t want to be in a situation where you are paying interest charges each month. Only put charges on your card that you can pay off by the deadline.
Will you have an opportunity to use the miles or points? You don’t have to be a big traveler to take advantage of many cards, but you want to make sure this is a card that you will benefit from.
If it’s a loyalty card, will you realistically use it for that brand without cramping your style? If you aren’t dedicated to a particular brand of hotel or airline, there are a number of great cards that allow you the freedom to use all manner of travel brands.

How do you strategically use an airline credit card?
9 strategies to maximize airline rewards:

Research thoroughly before choosing your card. Read the fine print. Do miles expire, and when? Are there blackout dates? Can you live with the limitations?
Make it your go-to card. See if you can pay your rent or utilities with it. Buy your groceries with it.
Don’t spend just to earn miles. Only use it to buy what you were going to buy anyway.
If you can’t pay it off in full each month, there’s no point in acquiring it. The interest fees will overshadow any miles or points you’ve earned.
Never go over the limit or pay late. These are wasted dollars.
Letting points expire are a waste. Keep track of when points are due to expire and plan ahead to use them so you aren’t wasting them on expensive travel dates. Also, with some programs, earning just one point can reset the expiration date.
Stay flexible and try a variety of travel dates when redeeming. For example, international flights are sometimes cheaper midweek. And flying on Christmas Day can be cheaper than flying on Christmas Eve.
Sign up for loyalty programs, use shopping portals and use travel portals that might earn you additional points, such as the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. Frequently check for deals.
Make a goal to use points for a trip, then do it.

What do you look for in a travel rewards credit card?
Here are 7 things to look for in a travel rewards credit card:

Is it flexible enough for your needs? There’s no point in taking out a card if you’ll never redeem the miles.
Will you earn more points than the cost of the annual fee? This is a deal breaker.
Will you use it without overspending? Never carry over a charge from month to month.
Are the benefits, such as complimentary auto rental insurance or airport lounges, items you will use? If not, there may be a good card for you with a lower annual fee.
Do you want a card with a shopping portal? This is a great way to save some money, although heads up that the rate of exchange can be lower.
Will you use the loyalty program, if there is one? For example, hotel brands might offer one free night after a certain number are purchased.
Are blackout dates or points expiration rules a deal breaker? As always, read the fine print.

How much is a frequent flyer mile worth?
While a frequent flyer mile is often worth $0.01, it can be more or less, depending on the program. For example, according to our valuation system, the Discover it Miles valuation is $.01 for every mile, while the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal, with the Chase Sapphire Preferred, is valued at $0.0126. That means if you have accumulated 30,000 miles with your Discover it Miles card, those miles are worth $300. If you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred and you want to redeem them in the Ultimate Rewards portal, you will get the equivalent to $378 when you redeem. (CreditCards.com’s valuation system: A reward value is determined by calculating the cost per reward unit [point or mile] for obtaining a good or service.)
How do you redeem airline miles?
When redeeming airline miles, sometimes it’s as simple as going into a portal after the purchase and clicking a button. In other cases, such as the American Express Delta cards, you log into your Delta account to purchase your tickets. Before choosing a card, make sure you are clear about the steps and decide if you can live with those steps.
In the same way that you need to make sure that you’ll take full advantage of the card’s benefits and that you’ll maximize the savings, you want to ensure that the way that you redeem suits your lifestyle. Some cards are very easy to use, allowing you to redeem for pretty much anything that is travel-related, including limousine service. Others allow you to maximize your miles with a travel portal that gives you a bonus for redemptions.
Do frequent flyer miles expire?
Frequent flyer miles often expire. Some, such as Delta, don’t. Others require your account to remain active, although that can be as simple as earning a single mile before the expiration date. Make sure you read the fine print so you aren’t scrambling to use your miles.The key is to stay organized. Plan a specific trip for your miles and budget how many miles you need to earn to reach your goal. Never, ever, go over what you can afford, and mark on your calendar when the miles would expire.
Can you transfer airline miles to hotel points?
Usually you can’t transfer airline miles to hotel points, but there are exceptions. The question is really: Should you do it? The answer to that is typically no, because the transfer ratios are rarely favorable. It’s best to choose your card carefully and make sure you will use it well.
Before applying for a card, look at your past history. Do you love and use the brand that the card co-brands with? Have you used that brand in the past, and will you use it in the future? How often will you use it? If you can see yourself earning enough points or miles to make the card worthwhile, go for it.
Can you transfer miles to another person?
You might be able to transfer miles to another person, but it may not be to your advantage financially because you may be charged a fee for the transfer. Instead, book an award seat for someone else by entering their name instead of yours in the portal. Just keep in mind that in the case of international flights, some airlines require to see the card that was used. Sometimes, even the cardholder has to be present at flight time, or the ticket isn’t honored.
Can you transfer miles from one airline to another?
Typically, you can’t transfer miles directly between airline loyalty programs, although you may be able to earn and redeem miles for flights on partner airlines. In fact, in some cases, partnerships offer a 1:1 ratio.
Research which airlines your card’s co-brand has partnerships with, taking special care to look for airlines that fly out of your city or to destinations you often travel to. Also, research the transfer ratio.
Before applying for a card, research several cards, because the best deal may not be your favorite brand. You may in fact find that a more general card will give you more generous miles earned or that a card includes partnerships with your favorite brand.
Is a travel credit card right for me?
There are a few factors that will help you decide if a travel card is right for you.
First, do you have strong credit? Travel cards typically require good or excellent credit, so there is no point in applying unless you have at least a 700 FICO score, the dominant scoring model that lenders use. It has a range of 300-850, with 850 as the best.
Do you have a good handle on your finances? To maximize a travel card, you need to be able to juggle a couple of balls. It’s not difficult, but if you are not sure how much money is coming in, how much you spend each month, and what you are spending it on, you may want to hold off on getting a travel card. Why? Because to use the travel card successfully, you will want to use the card as much as possible, but never on something you don’t already have the money for. A cashback card such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited may be a better choice for you for now, because it offers a straight 1.5% cash back and there’s no annual fee.
Finally, do you travel at least somewhat? You don’t have to be a jetsetter, but to take full advantage of the card, you’ll want to at least be someone who travels a couple of times a year, or on a few weekend trips a year. The best way to assess this is to look at your travel habits in the past year, study how much you spent, and track which airlines and hotels you stayed at.
With a little effort on the front end, a travel card can save you hundreds a year on travel expenses, give you free nights or even flights, or even grant you access to luxury airport lounges. Find the right card for you.

While 0% introductory offers are a great way to get out from under crushing debt, they can be a great way to get deeper into a hole, as well.
With a 0% offer, you can pay off debt interest-free for up to 21 months, depending on the card, saving you hundreds of dollars in interest fees. But it's important to have a plan for how you're going to pay off the charges. How much can you pay down each month? Will you be able to pay off the charges before the offer ends? Otherwise, you'll just pay interest fees on the charges once the offer ends.
The trick is to understand the rules of the game before committing to this kind of card. From balance transfer fees to go-to rates, we'll tell you how to choose a 0% intro interest card, pitfalls to avoid and how to use it going forward.
What are 0% APR credit cards?
Some credit cards have 0% introductory APR offers. What does that mean? Simply that you pay no interest on a card balance for a set amount of time, up to 21 months. This is handy when you've incurred debt and you can't get out from under the interest fees or you have a big purchase coming up.
There are basically two types of offers, sometimes in a single card:

Balance Transfer — This 0% intro APR offer encourages you to transfer your balances from older cards to the card with the offer. There is usually a balance transfer fee of 3%–5% or $5–$10, whichever is greater, but it can still be worth your while if you have a larger balance. That's because interest rates compound quickly, with you owing hundreds of dollars in interest within a few months.
Purchases — You can make a big purchase on your new card and pay interest–free for a set amount of time.

What does 0% intro APR mean?
The term “0% intro APR” means that you can pay interest–free for a set amount of time on balance transfers and/or purchases. The offer's length of time varies by card and can be as little as 6 months and as long as 21 months. For example, the Discover it offers an intro 0% APR on purchases for 6 months and a 0% APR on balance transfers for 18 months, while the Citi Diamond Preferred offers a 0% intro APR on both purchases and balance transfers for 21 months.
Heads up that there is usually a balance transfer fee, and if you are late paying, the card issuer might kick in the go–to APR. But if you pay on time and map out paying the debt before the offer ends, you can save hundreds of dollars.
How to choose a 0% APR offer
When it's time to choose a 0% APR offer, a number of issues come into play, including length of the offer and balance transfer fees. Here's what you need to know:

Check the length of the offer. Check how long the introductory rate (sometimes called the “intro rate” or “teaser rate”) will last. While you may think that the longer the introductory period, the better, it's actually more important to plan how much you can afford to pay each month so that you don't owe money when the offer ends.
Know your “go–to rate.” That's the rate after the introductory period. While this shouldn't be a deal-breaker, because you're going to pay in full each month (right?), it's prudent to know all the aspects of the card, including the go–to.
Ask about balance transfer fees if you plan to transfer an existing credit card balance to the new card. The fees generally run 3% to 5% of the balance transferred or $5-$10, whichever is greater. A few cards offer no balance transfer fee, such as the Chase Slate. Watch your mail: Card issuers often run special offers when they lower or waive the fees. 
Weigh other benefits, such as the 5% cash back offer of the Discover it Cashback Match, which also has a 14–month 0% intro APR on both purchases and balance transfers. Sometimes it's actually better to have a shorter offer period, because the card has benefits you'll use after the offer ends.

What is a go–to APR?
A go–to APR is the rate that kicks in once the 0% intro APR offer ends. So, if the card you've chosen offers an 18–month 0% intro APR, you have 18 months to pay for the balance, then the go–to rate kicks in. Your credit rating and your history of payments help decide what your rate will be. The better your payment history and the higher your credit rating, the lower the go–to rate.
What is the average interest rate on a credit card?
The average interest rate on credit cards varies based in part on the Federal Reserve's monthly decision on interest rates. Currently, the national average for credit cards is about 15.75%, but that can vary based on type of card. Low interest cards, of course, have the lowest average, at under 13%. Business and student cards are also low, both under 14%. The highest are instant approval, at just over 18% and bad credit, at over 23%.
That said, you should not be too concerned about a card's interest rate, because it's best to pay your card bill in full each month. It's better for your credit because FICO, the dominant credit scoring model, tracks your credit utilization ratio, which is the amount of available credit you have compared to the balance that you owe. The lower the balance, the lower your ratio, which FICO loves.
What is a good interest rate on a credit card?
Rather than choose a credit card because it has a “good” interest rate, look at the card's features, because credit cards are not meant to be long–term loans.
The national average for credit card interest rates is about 15.75%. Depending on the type of card, the interest rate will vary, with low interest cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top. But that shouldn't concern you too much.
Instead, look at the 0% intro rate for balance transfers and purchases when choosing a card. Then, make sure you can pay off the debt before the go–to rate kicks in. If you know you're going to go past the intro rate period, then make sure you pay on time to improve your credit rating, because your credit rating and your on–time payments are two factors for what your go–to rate will be.
What determines the APR on a credit card?
The APR on a credit card is determined by a number of factors, including the Federal Reserve's current rate, your credit rating, the type of card you choose, and whether you have been paying on time.
The national average go–to interest rate for credit cards is about 15.75% — that's higher or lower depending on the type of card, with low interest and student cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top.
When the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark for rates, you'll typically see credit cards' rates inch up.
Your credit rating and whether you pay on time also factor into your rate; credit cards can have a range from which they assign your go–to rate.
Watch out, because you can drive your APR up by paying late or going over the limit. That can also land you with fines and even loss of the card.
How do you calculate interest on a credit card?
The easiest way to calculate interest on a credit card is with our handy–dandy calculators. You can figure out how much interest you'll owe if you pay the minimum; look at how much you need to pay on a balance transfer each month to avoid interest rates; or see how long it will take you to pay off your debt.
That said, it helps to understand how credit card issuers calculate interest. According to Discover, just divide your APR (say it's 15%) by 365 days, or .041096%. So, if you have a balance of $1,000, the daily interest rate is $0.41, which accrues each day. At the end of the month, you owe $1,013.
That may not seem like much, but it can add up quickly. If you pay the minimum on $1,000 each month (15% APR), it will take you 54 months and you will pay $370.46 in interest. Better to just pay in full each month and not put anything on your card you can't afford to buy with cash.
How do you avoid paying interest on a credit card?
It's easy to avoid paying interest on a credit card – just pay in full each month before the due date. Remember, credit cards aren't meant to be long–term lenders. They should be for building credit and convenience. You don't want to use a card for an emergency when you don't have the cash nearby, because the interest fees can overwhelm you. Instead, build an emergency fund that you can tap when the unexpected occurs, such as a broken–down car or a medical bill.
In fact, it can actually be a good idea to pay more than once a month. Just to be safe, if you pay in full several times a month, you can potentially improve your credit even more, because you don't know when issuers report to credit bureaus – pay several times a month and increase the chance of having a low balance when issuers report. (FICO, the dominant credit scoring model, bases your rating on what the credit bureaus gather about your finances.)
Here's how it works: FICO compares how much available credit you have to how much of a balance you have. The lower the ratio the better. So, if you have $10,000 available credit and you owe $1,000, your credit utilization ratio is only 10%. Owe $3,000? The ratio jumps to 30%. If you pay several times a month, you increase the chance of lowering your ratio, which is a critical part of your score.
How do you use a 0% APR credit card?
There are myriad ways to use a 0% APR credit card. From making a big purchase, such as an appliance or grill, to using it to pay down an existing balance, 0% APR cards can simplify your life. There are some things you need to know, though:
The best way to use a 0% introductory period offer is to calculate how much you can pay each month for how long. So, if you make a $3,600 purchase, and can pay $300 a month, a 12–month offer is enough for you. If you plan to use the card for a balance transfer, keep in mind that you will probably have a balance transfer fee of 3%–5%. That means you will owe $108–$180 right out of the gate. But that can be worth your while if the interest you would pay otherwise is higher than the fees.
Is using a 0% APR card a good way to build credit?
Any credit card (including a 0% APR card) that is used wisely is a good way to build credit. With a new card, you are increasing your available credit, which can be helpful for your FICO rating. Also, each month that you pay on time, your credit rating gets a little kick. And if you are diligent about paying down your debt, that will also improve your credit as the balance goes down, provided you don't incur additional debt.
That said, taking out a credit card is only good for your credit if you are responsible with it. It is the fastest way to build credit, no matter the type of card, but it can be a disaster if you let charges pile up or if you don't pay on time each month. Before committing to a new card, make sure you will use it correctly.
Can you use a 0% APR credit card to help pay off student loans?
Paying off student loans with a 0% APR credit card can be tricky. First, you might owe more than you can pay off in the maximum offer of 21 months, which means you would probably be strapped with higher interest rates than you were paying on the student loan.
Also, you will probably have a charge of 3%–5% on the total, which is another expense you may not have expected.
Finally, it is actually worth your while to hang on to the student loan, because it's an installment loan. FICO, the dominant scoring model, likes a mix of credit types, and if you have a credit card and an installment loan, that can give your credit score a little boost, provided you're paying on time.
Should I cancel my 0% interest card once I pay off the balance?
It's rare when you should cancel your 0% interest card once you pay off the balance. That's because keeping it on hand is a great way build your credit. Here's why:
Let's say you paid off $3,000 within the 15 months your 0% intro interest offer lasted. Awesome, right? Now, you're so sick of credit cards, you want to cancel the card and go all cash. But not so fast.
Here's the deal: The fastest way to build credit is to have a credit card and to pay in full and on time each month. FICO, the dominant scoring model, loves it when you do that, and you will be rewarded within months of your good habits.
Still hate credit cards and want to pay in cash? There's a way to have the best of both worlds. Keep your card account active by putting a charge on it each month that you would make any way, such as your gym membership, then pay it off before the due date. Then, use cash envelopes or whatever system you prefer to stay within budget.
Whatever you do, don't put the card in your sock drawer, because it's only a matter of time before the issuer cancels the card because it's inactive.

A balance transfer can be a great way to consolidate payments and avoid interest if you're carrying a balance. With the right card, you can even reap rewards and benefits after you pay off the transferred balance. If you know how these offers work, and you know what other perks to look for, you can find the best balance transfer card to minimize your interest and maximize your rewards.
If you're not familiar with balance transfers, our balance transfer card reviews will help you discover what the details of each card are, and show you what rewards are worth.
What is the meaning of balance transfer?
A balance transfer means you transfer the balance from one credit card to a card typically with a lower interest rate.  Let's say you have $3,000 on Card A with a 17% APR. That means if you pay the minimum amount, it will take you 126 months and you will pay $2,241 in interest. If you transfer that $3,000 to Card B, with an introductory 0% APR for 18 months, that means you have 18 months to pay off the balance without paying interest fees, thereby potentially avoiding the cost of $2,241.  Balance transfers are also an option if you want to streamline your payments. Simply transfer your balances to a single card and make one payment a month.
What is a balance transfer card?
A balance transfer card is a credit card that consumers typically use to avoid paying a higher interest fee.  The balance on Card A is transferred to Card B, which may have a low or 0% introductory APR. Credit card companies will sometimes attract new customers with little to no interest for a set period, sometimes as long as 21 months, such as the Citi Simplicity. Balance transfer cards may also have a 0% introductory APR for purchases. For example, the Simplicity has an introductory 0% APR of 21 months for purchases. Each credit card specifies which balances will be paid first typically starting with the lowest–rate balances. Some balance transfer card rules specify that only transferred balances qualify for the lower rate, while new purchases collect interest at the regular, higher APR.
What is a balance transfer fee?
A balance transfer fee is the charge for transferring a balance from one credit card to another. The more you transfer, the larger the fee. A typical fee is 3%–5%, with a minimum of $5 or $10. For example, if you transfer a $10,000 debt from another card, you might pay a $300 fee right away. While that expense may seem hefty, assess whether you will actually save by transferring to a 0% introductory APR card to avoid interest fees, because you can easily spend thousands on interest fees. However, make sure you will be able to pay off the debt by the time the introductory offer ends, because the new card will likely revert to a go–to APR that can be 15% or more. See if it makes sense for you by using our balance transfer calculator.

Keep in mind that some balance transfer cards don't have balance transfer fees, such as the Barclaycard Ring Mastercard.
What is a balance transfer intro period?
A balance transfer introductory period refers to a low or 0% APR offer a credit card issuer provides for a limited period of time as an incentive to become a cardholder. A cardholder can pay down debt transferred from another card while not paying interest for the debt for an introductory period of time. A balance transfer intro period can last up to 21 months. After the set period, the interest rate can increase to a “go–to rate” of 15% or more. You should make sure you evaluate the balance transfer interest rate during the promotional period, the length of the promotional period, and the balance transfer fee when deciding which balance transfer offer is best for you.
What is balance transfer intro APR?
An introductory APR period is the amount of time you have to pay off the amount you've transferred without paying interest. A 0% APR period can last up to 21 months. Most balance transfer cards, with a few exceptions, charge you to move your balance. Generally, this fee is a percent of the balance you're transferring ranging from 3% to 5% depending on the card or $5–$10, whichever is greater. Since most cards' default rate can be higher than the rate you had on your old card, paying off your debt within the 0% period is crucial. Read the fine print, as some cards will void the 0% deal if you miss a payment.
How does a balance transfer on a credit card work?
Transferring the balance from one credit card to a card with a lower APR is referred to as a balance transfer. It should be noted that transferring isn't the same as repaying. When you use a balance transfer card, you are transferring the debt from Card A to Card B. Then, if Card B has an introductory offer, you can typically have a set amount of time, up to 21 months, to pay off the debt without paying any interest fees, although there can be a balance transfer fee. Other reasons to transfer a balance can be to consolidate your debts. However, avoid closing a credit card account, because having available credit helps your credit rating. So, if you transfer debt from Card A, now you have a card without any debt, which increases your credit utilization ratio (the ratio of your available credit to how much you owe). The lower the ratio, the better. That means if you keep Card A open, your available credit is boosted, and your ratio is lower. Also, Card A's payment history can help your credit. Just be sure to keep Card A's account active by charging a small monthly amount, and pay it on time and in full each month.
Are credit card balance transfers a good idea?
Transferring a credit card balance can be a good idea if you've incurred card debt and you are paying the minimum monthly amount. That can translate to high monthly APR fees that can be avoided if you transfer your debt to a card with a 0% introductory APR. However, make sure you have a plan to pay off the debt before the introductory offer ends, because balance transfer cards typically have a “go–to” rate that can be 15% or more once the offer ends.

Another good reason for transferring a card balance is consolidation. If you have debt on multiple cards, and you want to avoid the hassle of multiple payments, taking out a good balance transfer card can be wise. However, get to the root of the problem. Why do you have debt on multiple cards? If you are using your credit cards to buy items not in your budget, the problem may not be the cards. It may be your spending habits.

Also, taking out a new credit card to transfer a balance can be a bad idea if you are planning to take out an installment loan (a car loan or a mortgage) in the coming months, because lenders look for “hard pulls” or evidence of recent requests for credit. If you plan to buy a car or house soon, weigh whether any card debt you have could impact your application with whether lenders would be concerned about new cards. When in doubt, check with your lender before making any financial move.
Do balance transfers help your credit?
A balance transfer can certainly improve your credit – in the long term. A number of aspects of your credit score come into play when you transfer a balance to a new credit card, notably your payment history, which is your history of on–time payments, and your credit utilization, which is your available credit compared to your debt. To a lesser extent, the length of your old card's history and taking out a new card can also impact your credit. Here's how:

 Payment History
The most important (and most obvious) factor in play during a balance transfer is the opportunity to establish a better payment history. Payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score, the scoring model most used by lenders. Transferring debt from a high interest account to one with a 0% APR into period can significantly lessen the burden of maintaining a monthly payment schedule. You may have to pay a lump sum upfront in the form of a transfer fee, but the money you will save on interest can more than make up for it over time. If you pay more than the minimum amount and establish a plan to pay off the transferred balance before the introductory period expires, you will be debt–free years before you would if you pay the minimum. This will both save you money and improve your financial responsibility in the eyes of future creditors.
Credit Utilization
Along with an improved payment history, balance transfers can boost your credit by lowering your credit utilization (limit–to–balance) ratio. In fact, the second most important part of your FICO score is amount owed, at 30%. The credit utilization ratio is a measure of the debt you owe in comparison to the credit limit available to you. If you keep the old, paid–off card, that automatically boosts your ratio, because you have available credit with no debt. However, don't incur any additional debt once the new credit line has been established, or you'll defeat the purpose of building credit and get yourself back in your debt predicament.
Length of Credit History
Some 15% of your FICO score is made up by the length of credit history. And that's another great reason to keep your old card, so that you continue building your time with an older product.
New Credit
Some 10% of your FICO score is made up by new credit in your file. That's actually a reason to pause before taking out a balance transfer card – a new credit product can ding your rating, albeit not by much. Just be deliberate about your card choice, and make sure you don't have plans to take out an installment loan (car loan or mortgage) in the coming months, because lenders will be looking for any new products when they review your file.
Credit Mix in Use
The remaining 10% of your FICO score encourages a mix of credit products, such as credit cards and installment loans. For this reason, don't take out a balance transfer card without a plan, but a new balance transfer card can help your credit by allowing you to consolidate and to help you pay down your card debt.

Are balance transfers bad for your credit?
Used incorrectly, balance transfers can be bad for your credit. Used right, it can be great for your credit. Here's what you need to know:

When you apply for a balance transfer credit card – or any type of credit – it dings your credit. As a result, your credit score will drop by a few points. But if you plan to use the card to get your debt under control, that benefit can outweigh the disadvantage of those few lost points, which will be recovered within a few short months of good payment habits.
Planning to cut loose of that old card that has been weighing on your credit soul? Hold up, because a paid–off card with good credit payment history is credit gold. Here's how: First, the FICO scoring model likes it when you have a lot of available credit, but not much debt. So, if you keep the old card, you've increased your available credit when you take out the new card, and your percentage of debt goes down because of that additional available credit. Second, FICO loves credit accounts with a history of on–time payments, so it's worth your while to hang on to that card.
You've made the right decision to keep your old card, but you plan to lock it up in a sock drawer. Stop! By not using your old card, you run the risk of letting the account lapse, and that payment history clock stops. Keep using the card each month, but responsibly. More on that later.
Although you need to keep using your old card, you don't want to incur additional debt, because then your credit utilization ratio – remember the debt to available credit percentage? – will be too high. Here's what to do: Put a small monthly charge you would have anyway, such as your gym membership, on auto debit. But be sure to pay in full each month.
In some cases, making a payment even a single day late can cause the issuer to cancel your 0% APR period and leave you immediately subject to the high interest rates you sought to escape in the first place. Also, this will affect your payment history, so be sure to pay on time, or your credit will be surely affected.

Things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card
Balance transfer credit cards are a great way to improve your credit, used correctly. Used incorrectly, these cards can wreak havoc on your credit.
There are 5 things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card.

Can I withstand the credit score effects?
Applying for a new card requires a hard inquiry, which will temporarily drop your credit score. This can be recovered rather quickly and is generally not cause for worry. However, if you plan to take out an installment loan in the next few months, such as a car loan or a mortgage, these slight dings impact the interest rates or even whether you can land the loan of your choice. If your new card is the only credit you have on the horizon, then the drop in points will be temporary and relatively harmless, provided you continue to pay on time and keep your debt down.
What is the available credit limit?
The credit limit should be sufficient to cover the desired transfer amount without maxing out the new account. This way, you can take maximum advantage of the lower interest rates and improve your credit utilization ratio simultaneously. This ratio looms large for the FICO scoring model, the model most used by lenders. It is the amount of available credit you have compared to the amount of debt you have. The lower the percentage of debt, the better. That means the higher the new card's limit, the better, because any credit you aren't using counterbalances your debt.
How much is the transfer fee?
Low interest or 0% intro APR transfer cards usually require a transfer fee that typically ranges between 3% and 5% of the balance or $5–$10, whichever is greater. In most cases, this fee is minuscule in comparison to the interest charges you would otherwise pay and is therefore a good tradeoff. However, if the balance is low enough, it may not be worth paying the transfer fee in the first place. It's also worth noting that some card issuers waive the balance transfer fee, such as the Barclaycard Ring Mastercard.
How long is the introductory APR period?
The appeal of a balance transfer card comes in the form of a low or 0% intro APR, but these rates don't last forever. These teaser rates can be for up to 21 months, such as the Citi Simplicity. Look at all the card's benefits, though, because some cards have a shorter intro APR, such as the Blue Cash Everyday, yet they offer an introductory cashback offer and cash back for such purchases as groceries and gas. (Terms apply.) Think about how you'll use your card in the long haul. That said, make sure you only use such a card for purchases you can afford to pay off and after the balance transfer is paid so that you don't return to the cycle of debt you're trying to escape. Some cards, such as the Blue Cash Everyday, have a 0% intro APR for purchases as well.
Can I stay disciplined throughout the process?
Be true to yourself. If not, you could only worsen your existing situation. If you struggle with making monthly payments on time or don't trust your ability to cease acquiring debt, having another card at your disposal is probably not the best option. In fact, you may have difficulty even getting a new card if you have a history of late payments. Conversely, if you feel you are responsible enough to stick to the plan you have set for yourself, a balance transfer can bring you budgetary glory. If you think you can keep the old card active without incurring new debt, and you can pay down your new card without buying new items, a balance transfer card could be right for you.

How to select the right balance transfer card
Looking to land a balance transfer credit card? Here's how to select the right one for you:

Required credit scoreEven rejected applications require a hard inquiry and will ding your credit. Make sure you are within range of the card issuer's required credit. For a card that requires good credit, you need a FICO score of about 700 on a scale of 300–850. The higher the score, the more likely you'll land the card, although other factors also play in, such as multiple inquiries and wages. If you have your eye on a card that requires excellent credit, plan to have a score of at least 760, possibly more.
Sufficient credit limitThe available credit line should be substantial enough to cover the sum you're looking to transfer. Ideally, you would like to have a credit limit that allows for a full transfer and some breathing room. The higher your limit, the better, not because you can spend it, but because you won't. If you have air in your limit, or available credit that isn't being used, that can help boost your credit score.
Balance transfer feeMost balance transfer cards have a transfer fee of 3%–5% or $5–$10, whichever is greater. But some, such as the Chase Slate, offer for an introductory period of no transfer fee.
Lengthy introductory periodBalance transfer cards will offer low or 0% intro APR for up to 21 months. Use our handy–dandy payoff calculator to see how much time you need to pay each month and pay off the balance before the introductory offer ends. You don't want to get into a situation where you still have a balance when the offer ends, so choose wisely.
Reasonable ongoing APRWhile you don't want to have a balance remaining when the introductory offer ends, pay attention to the go–to APR rate, which is the interest rate your account will revert to once the offer ends. Ultimately, the go–to rate shouldn't matter, because you are paying your card bill in full and on time each month (right?), but it's good to pay attention to the details, just in case.
Annual feeOn the surface, you want a card without an annual fee, right? But annual fees are sometimes waived the first year, and the benefits of a card (such as cash back on a Blue Cash Preferred) can make the annual fee worthwhile. Think in the long term about how you plan to use your new card. If you solely want it for the introductory APR offer, you don't want an annual fee. If you plan to make it your go–to card once the balance is paid off, expand your horizons and look at balance transfer cards with bonus signup points or cash back and other perks.
Acceptable terms & conditionsThere are usually conditions that must be adhered to in order to take full advantage of the balance transfer. For example, an issuer will likely require a transfer to be completed within a specified amount of time to lock in the offered rates. In other cases, the introductory APR may be nullified if you are late on a single payment and the regular APR could kick in immediately. ALWAYS read the fine print!

How do you transfer a balance from one credit card to another?
Transferring a balance from one credit card to another is pretty straightforward. 
Simply place a call to the new creditor's customer service line. Communicate that you would like to transfer a balance onto your new card and a representative will guide you from there. You may also accomplish this online, though the exact procedure will vary depending on the bank. Heads up that you will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee, although some cards do not charge one, such as Barclaycard Ring Mastercard. Also, make sure you get terms with the new card that will allow you to pay the debt in full by the end of the introductory offer. So, if you owe $3,600 and the offer is 0% APR for 12 months, that means you need to make sure you can pay $300 a month for a year. That way, you don't pay interest rates on the balance.
How long does it take to transfer a balance from one credit card to another?
Generally, a balance transfer can be expected to clear within 7 days of the request being placed. However, the exact amount of time it will take varies and is dependent on a number of issues. Many people report that their balance transfers have been accomplished in under 48 hours while others have complained of a transfer taking upwards of two weeks to complete. Unfortunately, there's no clear–cut timeline.
In order to better gauge how long a transfer will take, consider the following factors:

Account AgeIf your account with the receiving creditor has been active prior to the transfer request, it will likely complete more quickly than with a newly opened account.
Transfer ProcessIf the money can be transferred electronically to the creditor, it will often take less time than payment via physical check.
Balance AmountLarge balances may take longer to complete, whereas balances of less than a specified amount could be fast–tracked in accordance with issuer policy.
Issuer/CreditorSimply, some banks just have a better reputation when it comes to completing balance transfers. Chase and Citi are two that come to mind.
Application MethodIf possible, submit your application online to ensure quality control; information relayed over the phone is subject to being misunderstood or incorrectly entered.
Time of RequestIs it close to the weekend? Are there any major holidays coming up? If so, the process might be delayed until normal business resumes.

Can you transfer a balance from one card to another from the same bank?
Typically, a bank does not allow a balance transfer between two cards it has issued. That's because it doesn't make good business sense for the financial institution. After all, banks and card issuers operate to make money on the debt you owe and a balance transfer represents a means of saving the cardholder money on that debt.
That said, the structure of a balance transfer exists as a win–win for all parties involved when the debt is being transferred from one creditor to another, as it is almost always done. This way, both parties are satisfied for the following reasons:

The new creditor takes on an existing debt but, more importantly, gains a new customer.
The customer pays a relatively modest transfer fee (typically 3% to 5% of the balance) but saves money in the long run by taking advantage of the 0% intro APR period and lower interest rates.

How to properly use a balance transfer card
Here are tips to properly use a balance transfer card:

Cease applying for new cardsOnce you get a balance transfer card, don't take out any more cards. Every time a card issuer checks your credit, which is done when you apply for a card, that dings your credit rating. A cluster of inquiries may paint you as being financially unstable. Also, additional cards only increase the temptation to spend.
Keep existing accounts openThe average age of your accounts is taken into consideration when determining your creditworthiness. Therefore, keeping older, established lines of credit active following a transfer only helps your credit rating. It will also help you obtain a more admirable credit utilization ratio, which is the second most important factor taken into account by lenders. The ratio compares the available credit to the amount owed. The closer to 0% the better. Finally, charge a small amount on your old card that you would spend anyway, and pay in full and on time each month. That keeps your account active, and it will actually help build your credit in no time.
Stick to your payment planBy now you should have planned out a strategy that will allow you to pay off the full balance before the introductory period runs out. This includes budgeting for any necessary fees, determining how much you will need to pay each month and identifying all stipulations that must be observed as part of the balance transfer agreement.
Stop incurring additional debtQuit adding to the problem. After all, there's a reason you sought a balance transfer in the first place. Halting charges on both the old and new accounts will save you from paying on the interest rates you fled and will make it much easier to abide by your payment schedule if the remaining balance isn't in constant fluctuation. Also, when you make new purchases, you run the risk of incurring interest fees, even while you are trying to pay off your old debt.

Advertising Practices
We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.
Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.
If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.
To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the Bank of America Online Privacy Notice and our Online Privacy FAQs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
