The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

TETRA Innovation Group (TIG)















Since 1981, TETRA Technologies, Inc. has served the global oil and gas industry with dedication, focus, and integrity. Since our inception, TETRA has had one goal…to deliver the best quality products and services based on innovative technologies, and best practices. We began in 1981 as a pioneer in the burgeoning completion fluids industry. Armed with new technology and a passion to succeed, our founders proved that focusing on customer needs positions us as a leader and supplier of choice in this market. 

To secure a guaranteed resource for our customers, we chose to make a substantial investment in the first clear brine fluid manufacturing facility dedicated to the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas operators cannot afford to take chances when drilling in the ultradeep basins around the world. They cannot risk damaging their payzone with an off-the-shelf clear brine fluid. TETRA offers customized, cost-effective, formation-specific fluids. Since we manufacture the completion fluids we sell, our customers have supply assurance to have what they need, when they need it, no matter the volume. 
TETRA’s Fourchon CBF facility is one of the largest on the Gulf Coast, providing quick turnaround and advanced fluid management service. Our many facilities serve, not only deepwater operators, but onshore and inland waterway customers as well. Speed and efficiency are coupled with the technology to blend our fluids to the condition found in any well. By controlling and monitoring the chemistry of our products, from manufacturing to placement in the wellbore, TETRA’s unique ability to produce fluids specially for our customer’s well conditions, sets us apart for all others in the industry. Since our customers need productive, trouble-free completions, our trained fluid engineers are able to design the optimum program for a successful displacement to provide a clean wellbore. 
Our customers also want innovative, cost-effective, frac water management solutions, including treatment, transfer, and storage. To meet that need, we manage the entire lifecycle of the frac water, keeping it reusable, utilizing technology, equipment, and best practices that respect the environment. With the largest fleet of onshore flow back well testing equipment in the USA and an extensive international fleet, TETRA has amassed a complete inventory of well testing technology and equipment that optimizes production through improving reservoir performance. 
The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price and to deliver significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services.
When wells run dry, TETRA provides the highest quality in construction, diving, cutting, plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning solutions and has been doing so since 1994.

Tetra Pond Bio-Active Pressure Filter with Green Free UV Clarifier


						The Tetra Bio-Active Pressure Filters with GreenFree UV Clarifier are designed similar and include the same benefits as the regular pressure filters.

Use pumps between 2,500 - 5,000 GPH on all models
2 Year Manufacturer Warranty
Pressure Filter & UV Sterilizer with easy Back Flush operation
For Maximum Flow use with 1.5" ID tubing. Also fits with 1.25" ID tubing

The Tetra UV Bio-Active Pressure Filter also integrates an Ultra-Violet Clarifier that provides permanent control of suspended algae which cause green water. The dome on top of the Tetra Bio-Active Pressure  Filter protects the clarifier.Note: Do not use with pumps that exceed 4500 gallons per hour. This could damage the filter. Do not use pumps with flows less than 2500 gal/hr. A minimum of 2500 gallons per hour is necessary to perform the backflush operation. All pressure filters restrict the flow from your pump. Expect about a 45% reduction in the water flow through the filter.How It Works:

Mechanical Filtration: Pond water flows down through the bio-activators, which remove suspended debris and dirt from the water.
Biological Filtration: Occurs on the massive surface areas found in the bio-activators. Beneficial bacteria will naturally colonize on the surface area and convert harmful pollutants in the water into relatively harmless nitrate, which are absorbed by the aquatic plants and from partial water changes. This is known as the "Nitrogen Cycle".

Open Profile Bio-Activators: TetraPond's new Bio-Active Pressure Filters come equipped with open-profile bio-activators which offer superior filtration and backflush performance over closed bio-media and foam.These bio-activators have been perfected and used in the commercial aquaculture industry where demanding filtration is required due to extreme environmental conditions. The advanced technological design of the bio-activators provides a large active surface area for the beneficial bacteria to colonize.During the backflush operation, these bio-activators provide unrestricted water flow to all the surfaces so that dirt and debris are thoroughly removed while leaving the beneficial bacteria on the bio-activator surfaces intact and robust.Filtration Process:
Pump water from the pond to the pressure filter.
Water is mechanically and biologically filtered.
Filtered water is forced up the center tube. In models with a UV Clarifier, the UV light destroys the single-celled algae's ability to reproduce.
Filtered water is forced under pressure to the waterfall or stream.

Tubing Attachment: For maximum flow, use 1-1/2 inch ID tubing. Also fits 1-1/4 inch ID tubing.Tip: For maximum flow; attach the largest tubing fitting. Use a saw to cut the filter outlet / inlet fitting(s) to match the tubing you have selected.How the Greenfree UV Clarifier Works: The TetraPond UV clarifier works by exposing single-celled algae to very high levels of Ultra Violet light as the pond water containing them is pumped through the clarifier. The water containing single-celled algae comes in close contact with the light from the UV bulb that is protected from the water by a quartz glass sleeve.The ultraviolet radiation disrupts the algae's ability to reproduce. The algae die and clump together, and then the algae can be easily removed by the bio-activators inside the pressure filter.For most ponds with normal levels of green water algae, the clearing process should take about one week. However, with thicker algal blooms this may take 2-3 weeks. The UV clarifier will reduce the growth of the algae, but water clarity is also dependent on the pond filter removing the dead algae.When installing the UV clarifier on a pond that already contains green water, the clarifying process can be rapidly accelerated by use of TetraPond Water Clarifier liquid that clumps single-celled algae and other particles together so they can easily be removed by the filter bio-activators.Unplug the UV clarifier if the pond is being treated with fish medications.Important: The pressure filter is not for submersible use, and should not be installed inside the pond.
