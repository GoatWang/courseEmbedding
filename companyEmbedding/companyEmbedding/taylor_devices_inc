					Full Description



Taylor Devices, Inc., incorporated on July 22, 1955, is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of shock absorption, rate control and energy storage devices for use in various types of machinery, equipment and structures. The Company manufactures and sells a single group of similar products that have a range of applications for customers. The Company's product categories include Seismic Dampers, Fluidicshoks, Crane and Industrial Buffers, Self-Adjusting Shock Absorbers, Liquid Die Springs and Vibration Dampers.The Company's Seismic Dampers are designed to ameliorate the effects of earthquake tremors on structures. As of May 31, 2016, Fluidicshoks were small, extremely compact shock absorbers with up to 19,200 inch-pound capacities, produced in 15 standard sizes for primary use in the defense, aerospace and commercial industry. As of May 31, 2016, crane and industrial buffers were larger versions of the Fluidicshoks with up to 60,000,000 inch-pound capacities, produced in over 60 standard sizes for industrial application on cranes, ships, container ships, railroad cars, truck docks, ladle and ingot cars, ore trolleys and car stops. Self-adjusting shock absorbers, which include versions of Fluidicshoks and crane and industrial buffers, automatically adjust to different impact conditions, and are designed for high cycle application primarily in heavy industry. Liquid die springs are used as component parts of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of tools and dies. Vibration dampers are used primarily by the aerospace and defense industries to control the response of electronics and optical systems subjected to air, ship, or spacecraft vibration.The Company competes with United Technologies.

Machined Springs









 


Machined Springs 

Introduction 
 




Home
 



Machined Springs
Taylor  Devices’ Machined Springs offer high precision, lightweight,  tension/compression operation, linearity, long life, and repeatability – with a  selection of metal alloys limited only by the imagination.
Originally  developed and qualified for military systems, our Machined Springs are used  today on diverse applications, including the International Space Station, newly  deployed helicopters, commercial aircraft engines, space vehicle rocket engines,  aircraft cargo handling systems, an abort system for a NASA rocket, a  classified U.S. Navy shipboard shock mitigation system, and precision vibration  isolation systems for airborne military optical systems, among many others.
Highly  precise analytical capabilities, as well as unique manufacturing processes, allow  Taylor Devices to produce Machined Springs to extremely stringent customer  requirements.
Benefits of Machined Springs include: 


Precision control of spring rate; usually ±2% or  better.


Tuning to establish a specific load at a specified  height.


Materials  including high strength steels, stainless steels, and various high temperature  alloys.


Designed for ultimate fatigue resistance.


Simultaneous  control of spring rate for operation in compression, tension, shear, and  torsion.


Machined-in  end fittings provide easy and rigid attachment.


Available  styles include helical, double start helical, and non-twisting beam types.


Maximum  corrosion resistance by using various special alloys and special coatings.


Accurately  tunable to a specific natural frequency.


High  linearity – Machined Springs are inherently linear because residual stresses  are eliminated and the coils never rest against each other as the spring  deflects.  Spring rate is the same in  both tension and compression.


Damping can be added using special materials.

                  One-piece  construction – Mounting flanges, attachment threads and other fittings can be  part of the Machined Spring.  The Spring  can be an integral part of the machine instead of an add-on.

Taylor  Devices’ Machined Springs are designed and manufactured for each specific  application.  Simply provide us with your  desired specifications and we will promptly provide a quotation.

Taylor Devices, Inc.














THE LEADER IN INNOVATIVE SHOCK CONTROL
Incorporated in 1955, Taylor Devices, Inc. is the leading manufacturer of Shock Absorbers, Liquid Springs, Shock Isolation Systems, Seismic Isolators, Vibration Dampers, Powerplant Snubbers, and other types of Hydro-Mechanical Energy Management Products.  Our products form the cutting edge of technology in our marketplace, and are backed by our 50+ years of successful experience in the shock and vibration control field.  Our products offer a turn-key solution to shock and vibration problems, with Taylor Devices providing full analysis, development, manufacturing and testing capabilities to satisfy the most exacting customer requirements.
TAYLOR DEVICES’ FACILITIES
Taylor Devices’ facilities are sited at two locations in the city of North Tonawanda, New York:
Tonawanda Island Facilities - Located at 90 Taylor Drive, includes corporate and engineering operations, product assembly and testing facilities, research and development, bonded storage and repair activities, and a portion of the Company’s production machining operations.
Buffalo Bolt Way Facilities - Located at One Buffalo Bolt Way, this site opened in 2012 and currently includes three buildings totaling 50,000 square feet in area on eight acres of land.  The Buffalo Bolt Way buildings include production machining, finishing, and packaging operations.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
As a defense contractor, Taylor Devices actively participates in funded Government directed research, in addition to the Company's internal R&D program.  Research projects are structured within three areas:  basic research, applied research, and product development.  The scope of the Company's research activity includes passive and active structural control, natural and man-made environmental effects, fluid chemistry, interdisciplinary interfaces, seal development, structural dynamics, and vehicle control and handling. Corporate policy dictates that virtually all basic and most applied research is conducted internally by full-time R&D Company employees.  This assures maximum width and breadth of emergent R&D activities with a minimum of corporate limitations imposed on research personnel.
PLANNING FOR FUTURE TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS
Taylor Devices' is constantly refining and improving its Shock Isolator designs and is tremendously proud of the performance of the Company's products in both military and commercial service.  Projects are now underway to adapting active control-structure interfaces into the firm's isolation systems.  These will allow the integration of electrically powered active controls into shock and vibration control products of this new century, when control by artificial intelligence or neural solution techniques are expected.

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."
