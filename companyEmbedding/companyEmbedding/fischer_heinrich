Fischer-Heinrich Replacement Parts Service « Return to suppliers list





OverviewSpare Parts FAQ 
In most cases, Transatlantic Connection, Inc. can supply new, 
		  original replacement parts from Fischer-Heinrich through our European and Asian Parts Service. 

		  Please contact us with the nameplate information (manufacturer, part number, serial number, etc.) 
		  for the part you are looking for. We will check with Fischer-Heinrich to see if the part is available, 
		  and provide a quotation to you. 

		  Transatlantic Connection’s Parts Service can help you get parts quickly and easily, 
		  without having to deal with overseas communication, payment, and shipping headaches. 
		  While we are not typically the official representative for a manufacturer, 
		  our global logistics network can quickly obtain virtually any "overseas" 
		  replacement part quickly and cost-effectively. 

		  To learn more about our European and Asian Parts Service, 
		  please visit our Overview and 
		  Frequently Asked Questions pages.



What exactly is your Spare Parts Service?Transatlantic Connection supplies spare parts originating from Europe and Asia. We aren't the official US representative for most of the companies we supply parts for, but we can get the parts quickly and cost-effectively through our global network of suppliers and shipping companies. Buying those hard-to-find overseas parts from us is easy -- we handle all the international communication, payment, and shipping issues for you.
What information do I need to provide to you?The more information the better. Typically, we would like to have whatever information can be found on the nameplate, but we need at least the manufacturer's name and part number. Information we would like to have when it is available/appropriate: serial number, town of manufacture, ratio (for gearboxes), electrical information (voltage, frequency, etc.)
Are you the official representative for all these companies?Transatlantic Connection is the US representative for many companies, but we do not officially represent most of the companies we are able to supply replacement parts for.
Can I get parts faster than you have quoted? Generally, yes. Parts typically arrive in the US via our weekly consolidated shipment, but we can coordinate a special shipment to save a few days. In extremely urgent cases, we are also able to arrange courier service. Should a critical spare part not be in stock at the manufacturer, we will also work with them to expedite production if possible.
Are you supplying the original part, or a substitute?Transatlantic Connection supplies the original manufacturer part. If the original is no longer available, we will work with the manufacturer of the part to identify a suitable replacement.
Can you provide technical support for products?For companies we represent, our technical staff in Rockford, IL is available to provide support. For parts from other manufacturers, our technical support team may not have the answer, but will work with the manufacturer to provide needed support. We are typically not able to provide technical support for parts not supplied by our company. 
Will I be billed separately for international inbound freight, customs clearing, and duty costs?In almost all cases, our quote to you includes all costs related to international shipment -- we won't surprise you with high additional charges at invoice. You only need to pay for the part and to get it from Rockford, Illinois to your location. In some cases, we may quote certain costs separately. If this is the case, the costs will be clearly shown on the quote.
Can you get "proprietary" parts?Sometimes parts are custom-designed for a particular OEM. If this is the case, the parts are usually only available from the OEM. In certain instances, we are able to supply parts, so please contact us with information for your specific part.
Do you stock parts?While we do stock some items, most items need to come from the manufacturer.
What types of parts are available?Virtually any type of component is available. We have supplied parts for most typical industrial equipment, but also some unusual ones -- hydroelectric plants, ski lifts, wind turbines, and ships.
From what countries can you get parts?Our supply chain is strongest in Germany, the UK, Japan, and Korea, but we can obtain parts from virtually all European and Asian countries.
The nameplate on my part is all in a foreign language. I don't know what number is what!Send us a photo of the nameplate. Several of our staff members are multi-lingual and can help with translation.
How long do I have to wait for a quote?For some items we have price lists, allowing us to quote right away. However, for most items, we need to check with the manufacturer for current pricing and lead time. Because of international time changes, this process typically takes at least a day, but can take longer depending on the time the manufacturer needs to calculate pricing.
Can you repair parts?We can typically coordinate repair at the manufacturer. If a part is deemed unrepairable, we will only invoice for the shipment cost to the manufacturer and any evaluation charge they have.
What is the warranty on parts I purchase from Transatlantic Connection?We extend the same warranty as the manufacturer of the part. Contact us for specifics on a particular part.

Heinrich Koch
Product Manager PolyestersUhde Inventa-Fischer
Heinrich Koch studied process engineering at the Technical University of Stuttgart, Germany. He received his diploma in 1988.For several years he was engaged at company BEKUM, a specialist for blow molding machinery. Starting with the design of extruders, he later on continued as manager of the research and development department.In 1997, he joined Karl Fischer Anlagenbau in Berlin, Germany, and as Project Engineer was involved in PET production and PET recycling projects.From 1999 to 2009, he was Project Manager for polycondensation plants for PET and other polymers, within the regions of Asia, Europe and Americas, and from boosting studies up to lump sum turnkey projects.In 2010, he became Product Manager Polyesters.
 
AbstractEnergy savings in PET polycondensation
The yields for use of raw material in PET polycondensation process has reached values of more than 99%. What can be further optimized is the use of utilities and especially energy, either as heating energy or as electrical energy.
Since many years developments have been made to optimize the use of heating energy. This resulted in less numbers of reactors, and one example is the 2R-process of UIF. But also the internals inside the reactors have been adapted to allow better efficiency. As an example stands the debottlenecking of existing plants by upgrading the equipment.
A further big step has been the introduction of the Melt-to-resin MTR® Technology, a continuous polycondensation process to produce PET bottle grade chips without the solid state polycondensation step. The elimination of a complete process step means less equipment with potential energy consumers. Even more important is the use of the latent heat crystallization after pelletizing which prevents the cooling of precursor chips to ambient conditions as it is state of the art in conventional PET bottle grade plants.
