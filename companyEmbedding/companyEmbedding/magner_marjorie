      ■ Marjorie Magner was promoted to chairman and chief executive
      officer (CEO) of Citigroup's highly profitable Global Consumer
      Group in August 2003 after almost two decades with Citigroup, the New York
      financial-services giant that emerged from the merger of the Travelers
      Group and Citicorp in 1998. She served as the Global Consumer
      Group's chief operating officer (COO) from April 2002 until her
      promotion. Under her leadership the organization, including retail
      banking, credit cards, and consumer finance, generated more than half of
      Citigroup's revenue during the first two quarters of 2003.
      Including her employment at Commercial Credit, a predecessor company,
      Magner had been with Citigroup since 1987. Associates depicted her as a
      personable leader whose drive, enthusiasm, and passion were tempered by a
      low-key personality.
    

      EARLY CAREER
    

      Following her graduation from the Krannert School of Management at Purdue
      University in 1974, Magner joined the Chemical Bank operations division,
      where her business-focused master's degree made her unique in a
      work environment dominated by men. Even though her gender was notable, and
      sometimes an issue, she forged ahead. When she was excluded from meetings
      held by male coworkers, she showed up without an invitation. "It
      was very brazen and I wasn't a particularly brazen person in those
      days. But I would show up and say, 'I know you forgot to tell me
      about this meeting, but it's okay. I'm here now,
      let's start.' They didn't do it much after
      that," she was quoted as saying (
      
        US Banker
      
      , October 2003). By the time she left Chemical she was managing director
      of the chemical-technologies division.
    

      MOVES TO CITIGROUP
    

      Magner started her Citigroup career at Commercial Credit, a forerunner of
      Citigroup, in 1987. Her move followed that of her Chemical Bank mentor,
      Robert Willumstad, who was a vice president when she started at Chemical.
      In addition to their common work experience, the two shared Brooklyn
      roots. Magner told the 
      
        New York Daily News
      
       that "People from Brooklyn are a little scrappy. It's a
      hard working community with high expectations" (August 7, 2003).
      Her responsibilities steadily increased; she served as president, CEO, and
      then chairman of CitiFinancial, the successor company to Commercial
      Credit. In 2000 she became head of Citigroup's Primerica Financial
      Services and Citibanking North America, and by 2002 she had been named COO
      of the Global Consumer Group.
    

      SIGNIFICANT PROMOTION
    

      In August 2003 Magner was promoted to chairman and CEO of the Global
      Consumer Group, reporting to Bob Willumstad. She had earned the respect of
      Citigroup Chairman and CEO Sandy Weill, who praised her for her skills in
      acquisitions and consolidations, a key Citigroup business strategy, and
      for her integrity. The appointment was part of Citigroup's
      succession plan for Weill, then in his early 70s. At the time of her
      promotion, Magner's responsibilities included North
       American Retail Banking, the Global Retail Banking product, CitiFinancial
      North America, CitiCapital, and Women and Company, which offered
      professional women financial services tailored to their needs. Analysts
      praised her as a high-caliber leader with extensive Citigroup experience
      that equipped her well for the job. Analyst Ken Worthington of CIBC World
      Markets said that "She is one of the best operators this company
      has. She has a tremendous track record" (
      
        New York Daily News
      
      , August 7, 2003).
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Magner, as described by associates and analysts at the time of her 2003
      promotion, was a calm and steady executive who motivated her employees
      through high expectations and confidence in their abilities. Although
      Magner told 
      
        US Banker
      
       that her management style was almost "boring" because it
      was so consistent (September 2003), one analyst commented that she was a
      "quality executive who knows the businesses very well" (
      
        American Banker
      
      , August 7, 2003).
    

      Magner served on the board of trustees for Brooklyn College, and she was a
      member of the dean's advisory council of the Krannert School of
      Management at Purdue. She also supported Krannert by returning as a guest
      lecturer in the 2003 Purdue Old Masters program. She had previously been
      on the boards of directors for the Welfare to Work Partnership, Dress for
      Success Worldwide, Port Discovery Children's Museum (Maryland), and
      the Maryland Business Roundtable for Education.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
