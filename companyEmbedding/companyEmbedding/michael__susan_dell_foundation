Grants & impact investing

Working with innovative organizations around the globe, we seek to identify, test, refine and grow non-obvious solutions to big, obvious problems. Since 1999, we have committed $1.38 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa.
We believe that through this work, we can transform the lives of children living in urban poverty today and improve the future for every generation.
This chart is updated quarterly and is based on funds committed from 1999 to date.

Home Funding 






Funding 

In working to create lasting social change our philanthropic approach is simple: identify the best individuals and organizations working on an issue, and then help ensure they grow and scale effectively.
The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation has always recognized the power of providing grants to partner organizations that we knew were already working hard to improve the lives of urban children living in poverty. By aligning with organizations that are already making a difference, we continue to make an immediate impact on the lives of thousands of children.






 









There’s no shortage of challenges in education, family economic stability and childhood health. To meet these challenges head on, it’s essential that we’re nimble in our approach. That’s why we use a range of financial tools and structures to support our work. In addition to our core grant making, we also use a selective, mission-driven impact investment strategy to help develop specific products and tools, as well as spur new markets that serve the poor, and we employ direct service agreements when an opportunity calls for specialized expertise.












Grants






We seek to fund projects that directly serve or impact children living in urban poverty, particularly in the areas of education, childhood health and family economic stability (including microfinance). The grants listed below represent grants that were active during the last 12 months. If you are looking to apply for a grant, please visit the apply page.

Home About us 






About us 

For more than 15 years, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation has worked relentlessly to help children living in urban poverty. In our early years, we focused our efforts on improving education and children’s health in Central Texas. But within a few short years, our reach expanded, first nationally and then globally. And in that time, one important lesson that we’ve learned is this: progress doesn’t come in giant rolling waves; it’s earned, one child at a time.
We start by identifying the people and places most in need and then work closely with our partners to find solutions that combine bold thinking with real-world experiences and hard data. We firmly believe that true progress and transformative, sustainable change is the product of time, hard work, and a willingness to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those who live and breathe the challenges we aim to overcome. Every child deserves a total commitment to every step forward – no matter how big or small. And they deserve a team that has the experience, resources and desire to make a difference in both the long and short term.
The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and its partner organizations are that team. Since 1999, we’ve committed more than $1.38 billion to the efforts of those organizations. We work together closely, as equals, to earn every inch of progress that we make. And in little and big ways, we move every child closer to the opportunities they deserve in life to achieve more.

United States
We want to help children and their families live healthier lives.








Across the nation, low-income students and families often struggle with community barriers to wellness. Many disadvantaged communities are wrestling with reliable access to affordable fresh food and safe physical activity.
Successful initiatives that reach across sectors to increase access to health, build demand for healthy choices, and promote healthy behaviors, are being replicated to broaden their impact. Health care is being redefined to promote wellness in a wide array of settings, and to employ strategies that support wellness instead of treating disease. Our team is a hands-on group. Because we have to be on the ground in communities where work is happening to make progress. To change social norms. To help children and their families live healthier lives.

A firsthand look at the new Dell Seton Medical Center












Central Texas
The work of our partners translates beyond the walls of institutions to create models of health from the lab bench to the patient bedside to healthier, engaged communities.








In Austin, as in most large urban areas, the zip code where one lives has a major impact on one’s health and life expectancy. Many factors contribute to such disparity, including poverty, access to healthy food and physical activity opportunities, education, rates of crime and violence, and existence (or lack thereof) of essential community infrastructure such as housing, and access to health care services.
We believe that Austin will be the beneficiary of health innovations that will come from a variety of partners – some steeped in experience and bringing the best they’ve seen to Central Texas, and some with new and refreshing perspectives. The work of our partners translates beyond the walls of institutions to create models of health from the lab bench to the patient bedside to healthier, engaged communities. We are excited by the promise of a community no longer focused on treating illness, but promoting wellness.

Technology report: Ed-Fi, the student info data base

14
May


Julia Lawrence of Education News is reporting on the growing acceptance of Ed-Fi in the article, Ed-Fi Signs Up More States, Teachers and Companies:
Collecting data on students in order to closely tailor the classroom experience to student strengths got easier last year with roll-out of Ed-Fi™ Tool Suite, a free software solution to help educators conduct useful analysis in a timely manner. Since its launch in July 2011, Ed-Fi™ has been used by schools and districts in 8 states, with 4 more taking advantage of the software’s functionality through the Shared Learning Collaborative. Nearly one in three teachers and as many students are now making use of this technology nationwide.
The software was designed to comply with the Common Education Data Standards which allows seamless transfer of knowledge between schools, school districts and the states. Companies who have licensed the software in order to integrate it in their own education-targeted products include e-Scholar, Curriculum Associates and Wireless Generation, among others. http://www.educationnews.org/technology/ed-fi-signs-up-more-states-teachers-and-companies/
The stated goal is to make student data more accessible and user-friendly for educators. A significant part of the push for more data has to with the introduction of Common Core Standards. See, Will ‘Common Core Standards’ increase education achievement? https://drwilda.wordpress.com/2012/02/page/2/
According to the Ed-Fi site, Ed-Fi is a product of the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation:
Developed for the K-12 sector, Ed-Fi is open, XML-based, and CEDS-aligned to integrate information from a broad range of existing sources so it can be sifted, analyzed and put to use every day.
Ed-Fi enables educators to:

Easily access current, accurate classroom and student-level data 
Develop more effective, progress-based lesson plans 
Strengthen student academic growth and achievement 
Conduct more objective, fact-based parent-teacher dialogues 
Integrate data from existing systems such as student information systems (SIS), grade book applications, curriculum planning systems, and benchmark testing and reporting systems 

Ed-Fi enables districts and agencies to:

Access consistent, comparable performance data across districts, schools and states 
Continuously monitor, assess and improve program effectiveness 
Manage evolving compliance-reporting requirements 
Integrate with existing infrastructures 
Ensure system interoperability 
Accommodate future technological developments 

Ed-Fi enables vendors to:

Develop reusable products for multiple districts, states and other vendors 
Align to existing national standards 
Address shifting requirements without major code overhauls 
Streamline and systematize complex integration processes 
Develop productized solutions for use among multiple districts, states and vendors 
Focus on innovations that address emerging needs and open new markets 

Available free of charge, Ed-Fi licenses provide school districts, state education agencies and vendors with access to all Ed-Fi components.
About Ed-Fi and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation
The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation was established in 1999 to help improve the lives of children in need around the world. The Ed-Fi initiative supports the goal of ensuring that all children have access to quality education in public schools, one of the foundation’s key objectives.
Designed to function as a national data standard, Ed-Fi was developed based on input from vendors as well as state and local education agencies. The Ed-Fi data standard is governed by foundation representatives working in collaboration with an advisory council of education agency representatives from states that opt to implement the standard. The Ed-Fi standard is vendor-neutral and does not require any specific vendor’s hardware, software or protocols.

http://www.ed-fi.org/faqs/
Here is a portion of the press release from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation:
AUSTIN, Texas, May 8, 2012 /PRNewswire/ — Since launching in July 2011, the Ed-Fi Tool Suite, including the data standard and dashboards, has gained significant momentum in K-12 education among state education agencies, school districts and vendors.  Eight states have licensed or are in discussions to license the Ed-Fi Tool Suite, and an additional four states will benefit from Ed-Fi-enabled tools through the Shared Learning Collaborative. This represents 34% of K-12 students and 36% of teachers across the United States. 
Ed-Fi is the only free, flexible and complete ed-tech solution to empower educators with relevant, timely, student-centric information that enables better data collection and reporting to improve decision making, facilitate targeted action plans and drive higher student outcomes. The Ed-Fi data standard aligns with Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) and facilitates secure data exchange among disparate data systems in the K-12 education sector. The Ed-Fi data standard enables interoperability among education systems that states and districts have already implemented, and enables organizations to build on prior investments in existing IT systems and processes. Most importantly, it puts the transformative power of information in the hands of teachers and other educators when and where they need it most: their classrooms.
Arizona, Kansas and New Mexico join Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texasin using Ed-Fi to power their ongoing efforts to ensure that educators have the information and insight they need to understand the individual needs of every student and be equipped to respond.
Vendors including e-Scholar, Curriculum Associates, SunGard and Wireless Generation have also licensed Ed-Fi. Further, the Shared Learning Collaborative (SLC) has chosen Ed-Fi to power its scalable shared technology services, which aim to accelerate progress toward personalized learning for every K-12 student in the United States.  The SLC will help existing and future instructional technology investments in states, districts and schools work better together, and will extend the reach and potential of Ed-Fi to additional states including Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina….
Ed-Fi does not replace existing education data or information systems, nor does it supplant existing data standards; it enables them to work together to give educators nationwide what they need: holistic portraits of students that are detailed, easy to understand and up-to-date at any given moment. Moreover, Ed-Fi addresses a long-standing challenge to meaningful systemic improvement in schools nationwide: The multiple and often non-interoperable information and education data systems used by schools, districts and states.
“Ed-Fi fills the persistent need in the education sector to harness the power of data already collected in school districts and states,” said Fey.
STATE EDUCATION AGENCY QUOTES
“Joining Ed-Fi and uniting behind a common data standard is an important step forward for Arizona’s education community to provide powerful student-level data to educators,” said Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal. “Arizona is undergoing transformative education reform, and improving the quality of education through sound data-driven decision making is a key part of that change. I applaud the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation for offering such a robust education technology solution, at no cost, to the Arizona Department of Education.”
“Colorado has consolidated 19 primary data collections, and we now have eight. We were able to do this by taking a student-based approach to data as compared to the old way of approaching data based on programs.  Ed-Fi wholly supports this enterprise view of data.  By streamlining the flow of information and eliminating redundant data requests, Colorado can reduce the data administration burden for schools while shifting resources towards using data to enhance performance,” said Robert Hammond, Commissioner of Education, Colorado.
“Use of the Ed-Fi standard allowed us to significantly accelerate the development life cycle for our Education Insight warehouse and dashboard projects, enabling us to move from analysis to production in just 12 months. Ed-Fi provided a compass that guided the transformation of data from a variety of disparate data sources into meaningful real-time metrics for classroom decision-making, while allowing us to customize the teacher dashboard to the specific needs of Delaware educators,” said Reese Robinson, Education Insight Project Manager, Delaware Department of Education….
About Ed-Fi
Ed-Fi is a universal educational data standard and tool suite that enables vital academic information on K-12 students to be consolidated from the different data systems of school districts throughout the United States. Ed-Fi acts as a universal translator of academic data, integrating and organizing information so that educators can start addressing the individual needs of each student from day one, and can measure progress and refine action plans throughout the school year.
Developed through funding from the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, Ed-Fi licenses provide school districts, state education agencies and vendors with unrestricted access to all Ed-Fi components free of charge. For more information, visit www.ed-fi.org. The Ed-Fi initiative supports the goal of ensuring that all children have access to quality education in public schools, one of the foundation’s key objectives. http://www.educationnews.org/technology/ed-fi-signs-up-more-states-teachers-and-companies/
Schools also have to be concerned with student privacy rights.
Kelly Field reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education article, New Rules Would Allow for A Broader Sharing of Student Records
The Department of Education will release new rules today that will make it easier for states to develop data systems to track students’ academic progress and evaluate education programs.
The proposed new rules would allow high-school administrators and state officials to share student-level data with researchers, auditors, and other agencies without violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or Ferpa.
The changes are being welcomed by education reformers but criticized by privacy advocates, who fear they could undermine longstanding student protections. Under Ferpa, colleges must generally obtain a student’s consent to release data from an education record.
In an effort to strike a balance between privacy and accountability, the department has hired a chief privacy officer and created a technical-assistance center to advise states, schools, and colleges on privacy and data security.
But critics of the rule say such efforts won’t do enough to protect students in the face of expanded data-sharing.

Although, the database may make accessing student information easier, student privacy concerns should also be addressed.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
