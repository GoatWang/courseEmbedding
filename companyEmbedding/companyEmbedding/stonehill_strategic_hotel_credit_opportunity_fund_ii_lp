      Opportunity Fund




$50 Million Fund to Acquire and Originate Debt Investment for 
      Limited- and Select-Service Hotels








September 22, 2014 08:56 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stonehill Strategic Capital, LLC (“SSC”), an affiliate of Peachtree 
      Hotel Group II, LLC (“Peachtree Hotel Group”), today announced the first 
      closing of Stonehill Strategic Hotel Credit Opportunity Fund, with 
      initial equity commitments to purchase approximately $50 million of 
      interests. The fund will use the proceeds from its offering to provide 
      permanent mortgages, bridge loans, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and 
      discount note purchases, with a target of acquiring or originating up to 
      $300 million of hotel financing. The fund will assemble a portfolio of 
      debt instruments secured by premium branded, limited- and select-service 
      hotels in secondary markets, geographically dispersed throughout the 
      United States. Proceeds from the fund will enable SSC to swiftly and 
      efficiently underwrite and quickly close at higher loan-to-value levels, 
      giving SSC a unique advantage over its competitors and traditional bank 
      lenders.
    


      “We provide creative financing structures along with higher leverage 
      debt positions to allow borrowers to reduce their equity requirements on 
      acquisitions, refinancings and recapitalizations,” said Greg Friedman, 
      CEO of both Peachtree Hotel Group and SSC. “Our fund will play a key 
      role in completing the capital stack. In addition to providing first 
      mortgages, we will provide mezzanine debt and preferred equity financing 
      structures. Our lending program will allow for total leverage of up to 
      85 percent loan to cost. Our extensive experience and relationships in 
      the hotel industry will help us identify and execute viable 
      transactions.”
    

      “We believe the current hotel environment and outlook continues to offer 
      excellent opportunities for experienced hoteliers,” said Mat Crosswy, 
      president of SSC. “While debt funding is more readily available, 
      obtaining higher leverage remains difficult for most borrowers. That’s 
      where we believe this fund will excel.”
    

      “Our past capital deployment programs have achieved tremendous results 
      for our borrowers and investors thus far, and we look forward to 
      continued, positive growth.”
    

      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation of an offer to buy any interests described herein. Any 
      offer must be made by means of a private placement memorandum. No sale 
      of interests may be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, 
      solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or 
      qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Past 
      performance does not guarantee future results. The interests in the fund 
      have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
      and interests may not be offered or sold in the United States absent 
      registration under such act and applicable state securities laws or an 
      applicable exemption from those registration requirements.

ATLANTA—Stonehill Strategic Capital, LLC (SSC), an affiliate of Peachtree Hotel Group II, LLC,  is looking to transact $500 million in fixed-rate permanent loans, floating-rate bridge loans, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and discounted note purchases this year.
SSC closed $25 million in loans in December and an additional $65 million is under signed application scheduled to close shortly, according to the company.
Additionally, SSC’s affiliate closed on its hotel credit opportunity fund, Stonehill Strategic Hotel Credit Opportunity Fund, which will provide the capital to meet SSC’s lending goals for 2015. 
“We exceeded our most optimistic forecasts during 2014, our first full year since inception, and set the stage for a very fruitful second year and beyond," stated Mat Crosswy, president of SSC. “Adding a permanent-loan product is an important milestone in our company's growth that directly complements the existing debt solutions we can provide our clients. This allows SSC to take a client through the entire life of an asset.”
Stonehill completed 19 transactions in 2014 totaling more than $150 million. Stonehill deployed capital in a variety of transactions, including bridge loans, permanent loans, mezzanine loans and preferred-equity investments.
Crosswy noted with the supply pipeline remaining close to 1% of total room demand, increasing average daily rate, and transaction activity shifting to secondary and tertiary markets, the demand for hotel financing will remain healthy for the coming year. “With supply in check and occupancy projected to reach record highs, confident owners likely will be eager to complete renovation projects and refinancing. All signs point to a strong 2015 and 2016 for the industry."

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

Stonehill Strategic Capital Primed to Provide $500 Million in Hotel Financing in 2015

Industry Update




Press Release 3 February 2015Stonehill Strategic Capital Primed to Provide $500 Million in Hotel Financing in 2015 

Stonehill Strategic Capital, LLC ("SSC"), an affiliate of Peachtree Hotel Group II, LLC ("Peachtree Hotel Group"), today announced that it is poised to transact $500 million in fixed rate permanent loans, floating rate bridge loans, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and discounted note purchases during 2015. SSC successfully closed $25 million in loans in December 2014 and an additional $65 million is under signed application scheduled to close in January or early February 2015. Additionally, SSC's affiliate closed on its hotel credit opportunity fund, Stonehill Strategic Hotel Credit Opportunity Fund, which will provide the capital to meet SSC's lending goals for 2015.

"We exceeded our most optimistic forecasts during 2014, our first full year since inception, and set the stage for a very fruitful second year and beyond," said Mat Crosswy, president of SSC. "Adding a permanent loan product is an important milestone in our company's growth that directly complements the existing debt solutions we can provide our clients. This allows SSC to take a client through the entire life of an asset. By all measures, 2015 looks incredibly bright for both our company and the industry at large."

Stonehill completed 19 transactions in 2014 totaling more than $150 million. Stonehill deployed capital in a variety of transactions, including bridge loans, permanent loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments.
Stonehill Predicts Increased Activity in Secondary and Tertiary Markets
Crosswy noted that with the supply pipeline remaining close to one percent of total room demand, increasing average daily rate (ADR), and transaction activity shifting to secondary and tertiary markets, the demand for hotel financing will remain healthy for the coming year. "With supply in check and occupancy projected to reach record highs, confident owners likely will be eager to complete renovation projects and refinancing. All signs point to a strong 2015 and 2016 for the industry," Crosswy added.
Crosswy also pointed out that in terms of transaction volume, 2014 will be hard to beat. "Last year was huge in terms of portfolio and trophy property transactions," Crosswy stated. "However, in our niche of transactions between $5 and $20 million that tend to be focused outside the top 40 MSAs, we think there will be an increase in activity year-over-year. We're going to start to see the cusp of the pre-recession CMBS loan originations from 2005, and as those deals roll, owners will have to either refinance or sell depending on their desired long-term strategy. We anticipate that will be a prevalent scenario this year."
