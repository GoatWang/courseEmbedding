Early life and education[edit]
He was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955.[3] He attended San Diego State University.[4]
Career[edit]
After Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium 1977-1978, and an executive vice president for the Price Company 1978-1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company which acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO.[2] He remains on Costco's Board of Directors. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally—a task that virtually all major retail chain leaders delegate to subordinates. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first "warehouse club" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services.[4]
Sinegal was a protégé of the legendary Sol Price, widely considered to be the 'father' of the "warehouse store" concept (i.e., selling high volumes of a small variety of goods, at supposedly 'wholesale'-level-low prices, to a select group of customers—who pay a membership fee in exchange for the right to shop there). Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees—at every level of the company, including the stores—compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the lowest employee turnover rate in retail.
In 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price’s earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price’s breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc.
In 1997, the name of Sinegal’s company was changed to Costco Wholesale.
In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, “We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now." A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, “you have to take the shit with the sugar”. Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later (a return of 354% [15.855%, annually]). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.
In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[5][6]
On December 31, 2012, Sinegal retired, currently serves as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. [7]
Compensation[edit]
According to Costco's Proxy statement filed for 2011, Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,191,159.[8] This amount does not reflect grants of plan-based awards, outstanding equity awards, or changes to other potential Costco-related holdings.
Personal life[edit]
In 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise.[9] The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern—displeased that state and local taxpayers and politicians refused the NBA's demands that they pay for a new arena, in order to keep the team in Washington—had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).
Sinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children.[10] Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA.[11] Sinegal is an avowed Democrat,[12] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[13]

Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later (a return of 354% [15.855%, annually]). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.
In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[5][6]
On December 31, 2012, Sinegal retired, currently serves as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. [7]
Compensation[edit]
According to Costco's Proxy statement filed for 2011, Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,191,159.[8] This amount does not reflect grants of plan-based awards, outstanding equity awards, or changes to other potential Costco-related holdings.
Personal life[edit]
In 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise.[9] The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern—displeased that state and local taxpayers and politicians refused the NBA's demands that they pay for a new arena, in order to keep the team in Washington—had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).
Sinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children.[10] Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA.[11] Sinegal is an avowed Democrat,[12] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[13]

Early life and education[edit]
He was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955.[3] He attended San Diego State University.[4]
Career[edit]
After Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium 1977-1978, and an executive vice president for the Price Company 1978-1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company which acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO.[2] He remains on Costco's Board of Directors. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally—a task that virtually all major retail chain leaders delegate to subordinates. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first "warehouse club" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services.[4]
Sinegal was a protégé of the legendary Sol Price, widely considered to be the 'father' of the "warehouse store" concept (i.e., selling high volumes of a small variety of goods, at supposedly 'wholesale'-level-low prices, to a select group of customers—who pay a membership fee in exchange for the right to shop there). Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees—at every level of the company, including the stores—compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the lowest employee turnover rate in retail.
In 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price’s earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price’s breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc.
In 1997, the name of Sinegal’s company was changed to Costco Wholesale.
In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, “We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now." A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, “you have to take the shit with the sugar”. Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later (a return of 354% [15.855%, annually]). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.
In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[5][6]
On December 31, 2012, Sinegal retired, currently serves as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. [7]
Compensation[edit]
According to Costco's Proxy statement filed for 2011, Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,191,159.[8] This amount does not reflect grants of plan-based awards, outstanding equity awards, or changes to other potential Costco-related holdings.
Personal life[edit]
In 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise.[9] The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern—displeased that state and local taxpayers and politicians refused the NBA's demands that they pay for a new arena, in order to keep the team in Washington—had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).
Sinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children.[10] Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA.[11] Sinegal is an avowed Democrat,[12] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[13]

                                    James Sinegal - Biography                                
James D. Sinegal (born January 1, 1936) is co-founder and CEO of Costco, an international low-price membership retail chain and the largest U.S. wholesale club, headquartered in Issaquah, Washington, U.S..  
He was born January 1, 1936 into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His mother placed him in a orphanage as she was unable to take care of him. Later in his life, when he was 11, she "re-adopted' Mr. Sinegal and he met his new step father, Giuseppe Siniscalli (later changed to Sinegal) who came over from Pisticci, Italy in 1901 at the age of 1 year old. He took his step-fathers last name as Sinegal was not close to his biological father. His biological fathers last name is Wright. He attended Helix High School in La Mesa, California.  He earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955.  Sources vary on his higher educational attainment.  Some sources indicate he earned a BA from San Diego State University (1959) and others that he dropped out of college when he found his true vocation.  
After he started as a bagger at FedMart in 1954 he found he loved retailing.  At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations.  He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium 1977-1978, and an executive vice president for the Price Company 1978-1979.  From 1979-1983 he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlain and Associates, a company which acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products.  Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco and from 1983 he has been President and CEO of Costco.  His innovations made Costco the first warehouse club to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations.  
He was a protege of Sol Price, who pioneered the concept of the warehouse store that sells high volumes of a small variety of goods to members only.  Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management that offers employees high benefits and rewards.  
In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he was not interested in Wall Street analysts who took issue with his care for employees and customers rather than happier shareholders.  Investors might want higher earnings but Sinegal stated “We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now."  A favorite saying of his is “you have to take the shit with the sugar”.  Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 had $43,564 ten years later, a return of 354% (or 15.855% annually).  
He married Janet L. Dwyer in San Diego on July 21, 1962 and they have three children.  
In 2009, Mr. Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.

  Compensation 
According to documentation provided by Costco Wholesale Corporation, in fiscal year 2007 Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,981,202.  In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $3,787,280, which included a base salary of $350,000, a cash bonus of $80,000, and stocks granted of $3,290,150. In 2009, he earned a total compensation of $2,734,276, which included a base salary of $350,000, a cash bonus of $75,000, stocks granted of $2,230,700, and other compensation totaling $78,576.

 Sports
On March 6, 2008 Seattle's Mayor announced that a local ownership group involving Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer made a "game changing" commitment to invest $150 million in cash towards a $300 million renovation of Key Arena and were ready to purchase the Seattle SuperSonics in order to keep them in the City of Seattle. The members of the local ownership group included Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Seattle developer Matt Griffin, Jim Sinegal, and wireless magnate John Stanton.  Following the 2007–08 season, the team relocated to Oklahoma City, and now play as the Oklahoma City Thunder.

James SinegalBornJames D. Sinegal(1936-01-01) January 1, 1936 (age 81)Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaNationalityAmericanAlma materSan Diego State UniversityOccupationBusinessmanKnown forfounder and former CEO, CostcoSuccessorW. Craig JelinekSpouse(s)Janet SinegalChildren3James D. Sinegal (born January 1, 1936)[1] is the co-founder and former CEO of Costco,[2] an international retail chain.Contents1 Early life and education2 Career3 Compensation4 Personal life5 ReferencesEarly life and educationHe was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955.[3] He attended San Diego State University.[4]CareerAfter Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium 1977-1978, and an executive vice president for the Price Company 1978-1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company which acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO.[2] He remains on Costco's Board of Directors. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally—a task that virtually all major retail chain leaders delegate to subordinates. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first "warehouse club" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services.[4]Sinegal was a protégé of the legendary Sol Price, widely considered to be the 'father' of the "warehouse store" concept (i.e., selling high volumes of a small variety of goods, at supposedly 'wholesale'-level-low prices, to a select group of customers—who pay a membership fee in exchange for the right to shop there). Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees—at every level of the company, including the stores—compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the lowest employee turnover rate in retail.In 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price’s earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price’s breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc.In 1997, the name of Sinegal’s company was changed to Costco Wholesale.In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, “We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now." A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, “you have to take the shit with the sugar”. Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later (a return of 354% [15.855%, annually]). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[5][6]On December 31, 2012, Sinegal retired, currently serves as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. [7]CompensationAccording to Costco's Proxy statement filed for 2011, Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,191,159.[8] This amount does not reflect grants of plan-based awards, outstanding equity awards, or changes to other potential Costco-related holdings.Personal lifeIn 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise.[9] The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern—displeased that state and local taxpayers and politicians refused the NBA's demands that they pay for a new arena, in order to keep the team in Washington—had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).Sinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children.[10] Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA.[11] Sinegal is an avowed Democrat,[12] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[13]References^ http://www.usnews.com/listings/best-leaders/20-jim-sinegal Archived January 10, 2014, at the Wayback Machine.^ a b Allison, Melissa, "Costco's colorful CEO, co-founder Jim Sinegal to retire", The Seattle Times, August 31, 2011^ "Jim Sinegal".

Jim Sinegal, Costco's co-founder and longtime chief executive officer, jokes that being replaced by President and Chief Operating Officer Craig Jelinek "will be an upgrade."

Even when Costco Wholesale co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jim Sinegal talks about leaving the company he built into the country’s third-largest retailer, he exudes his quirky mix of humble, frank and feisty.
“It’ll be an upgrade,” Sinegal joked about being replaced as CEO on Jan. 1 by President and Chief Operating Officer Craig Jelinek. “He is well-liked and smart and energetic and all the things that I used to be.”
One of the most colorful personalities in retailing, Sinegal is known for his integrity, his unwillingness to squeeze customers or employees to please Wall Street, and his abiding love of $1.50 hot dogs.


He will turn 76 on Jan. 1 and plans to spend one more year working full time for Costco, helping with the CEO transition at the Issaquah-based company. “I’ll advise when I’m asked and try not to interfere and meddle,” he said.

The warehouse chain’s other co-founder, Jeff Brotman, will remain as chairman.
Sinegal said his age and the fact that Costco is in good shape made January the right time to step down as CEO.
“This is a positive move for Costco, and I feel very good about it,” he said. “Everybody says that, and it sounds like a lot of bull, but I mean it.”
Sinegal is “an industry statesman,” said Ed Weller, a senior research analyst at ThinkEquity in San Francisco who has known Sinegal since the mid-1980s.
“He’s done an astounding job for an astounding period of time,” he said. “He has been and will probably remain a force within the company and the industry.”
Jelinek, 59, began as a Costco warehouse manager in 1984, and has served in major roles throughout Costco’s business operations and merchandising activities.

His early 2010 promotion to the role of president — which had been one of Sinegal’s titles — and chief operating officer indicated he was in line for the CEO spot.
“Not a lot’s going to change,” Jelinek said in a telephone interview.
He and Sinegal learned the discount business at California chains founded by Sol Price. They both worked at Fed-Mart, and Sinegal followed Price to Price Club, which merged with Costco in the early ’90s.
“We’re both good with people, and we have the same values in terms of running the business,” said Jelinek, who learned about a week ago that Sinegal planned to retire.


“I felt that I was blessed, and it was an opportunity,” Jelinek said. “This company’s been a big part of my life, and this is what I do.”
Since becoming president and COO last year, Jelinek has accompanied Sinegal to the opening of every Costco warehouse in the world.






Like Sinegal, he reveres the company’s $1.50 hot dog, which comes with a soft drink and is sold in Costco warehouses worldwide.
Jelinek said he is not about to raise that price.
“Absolutely not,” he said. “We haven’t raised it in 26 years, and I don’t see us raising it. That’s a trademark of ours.”
Sinegal steps down after seeing Costco through a recession in which other retailers slashed jobs, eliminated stores and went out of business.
Costco laid off no one, aside from its usual seasonal workers and extra people hired for new-store openings. It also refused to cut back on health benefits, despite rising costs and pressure from Wall Street — and Sinegal has steadfastly resisted marking up the company’s prices on branded items any more than 14 percent.
Costco’s sales and profits are rising, and its stock is near an all-time high.






It slowed the pace of new-store openings, largely because it had trouble finding sites as shopping-center developers and banks went out of business.
Consumers kept paying their membership fees of $50 or $100 during the economic crisis because of the value Costco offers.
“He’s done an amazing job of keeping the company focused on their core values to create one of the strongest consumer franchises in the world,” said Weller, the research analyst.
“Eighty-nine percent of its members renew every year, and if you figure some of them move away and die, that suggests a very powerful commitment,” he said.
The rate for business members is higher: above 90 percent. “I think the technical term for that is astonishing,” Weller said.
Costco does not press suppliers for impossibly low prices, he said, but Sinegal insists on integrity and honesty.






The chain famously pulled Coca-Cola from its shelves in 2009 after learning that it was not getting the soda manufacturer’s lowest price. In a few weeks, the companies reached an agreement and Coke products were back. “They force a certain kind of honesty on certain suppliers and vendors,” Weller said.

James D. Sinegal (born January 1, 1936)[1] is the co-founder and former CEO of Costco,[2] an international retail chain.

Early life and education[edit]
He was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955.[3] He attended San Diego State University.[4]
Career[edit]
After Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium 1977-1978, and an executive vice president for the Price Company 1978-1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company which acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO.[2] He remains on Costco's Board of Directors. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally—a task that virtually all major retail chain leaders delegate to subordinates. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first "warehouse club" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services.[4]
Sinegal was a protégé of the legendary Sol Price, widely considered to be the 'father' of the "warehouse store" concept (i.e., selling high volumes of a small variety of goods, at supposedly 'wholesale'-level-low prices, to a select group of customers—who pay a membership fee in exchange for the right to shop there). Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees—at every level of the company, including the stores—compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the lowest employee turnover rate in retail.
In 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price’s earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price’s breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc.
In 1997, the name of Sinegal’s company was changed to Costco Wholesale.
In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, “We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now." A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, “you have to take the shit with the sugar”. Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later (a return of 354% [15.855%, annually]). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.
In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[5][6]
On December 31, 2012, Sinegal retired, currently serves as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. [7]
Compensation[edit]
According to Costco's Proxy statement filed for 2011, Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,191,159.[8] This amount does not reflect grants of plan-based awards, outstanding equity awards, or changes to other potential Costco-related holdings.
Personal life[edit]
In 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise.[9] The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern—displeased that state and local taxpayers and politicians refused the NBA's demands that they pay for a new arena, in order to keep the team in Washington—had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).
Sinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children.[10] Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA.[11] Sinegal is an avowed Democrat,[12] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[13]

Early life and education[edit]
He was born January 1, 1936, into a Catholic working-class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Lawrence O'Toole primary school, Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh), Helix High School in La Mesa, California, and earned an AA at San Diego City College in 1955.[3] He attended San Diego State University.[4]
Career[edit]
After Sinegal started as a grocery bagger at FedMart in 1955, he discovered that he loved the retail business, and was excited by the opportunities at this rapidly growing retailer. At FedMart, he worked his way up to executive vice president in charge of merchandising and operations. He was a vice president of merchandising for Builders Emporium 1977-1978, and an executive vice president for the Price Company 1978-1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked with Sinegal/Chamberlin and Associates, a company which acted as a broker and sales representative for food and non-food products. Together with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman, he co-founded Costco. From 1983 until his December 31, 2011 retirement, Sinegal served as Costco's president and CEO.[2] He remains on Costco's Board of Directors. As CEO, Sinegal was well known for traveling to each location every year, to inspect them personally—a task that virtually all major retail chain leaders delegate to subordinates. Sinegal's innovations made Costco the first "warehouse club" to include fresh food, eye-care clinics, pharmacies, and gas stations in its mix of goods and services.[4]
Sinegal was a protégé of the legendary Sol Price, widely considered to be the 'father' of the "warehouse store" concept (i.e., selling high volumes of a small variety of goods, at supposedly 'wholesale'-level-low prices, to a select group of customers—who pay a membership fee in exchange for the right to shop there). Sinegal is known for a benevolent style of management rooted in the belief that employees who are treated well, will in turn, treat/serve customers well. Sinegal, through Costco, provided his employees—at every level of the company, including the stores—compensation and benefits that are much higher than retail industry norms. For example, over 90% of Costco employees qualify for employer-sponsored health insurance; the U.S. retail industry average is just under sixty percent. As a result, Costco has the lowest employee turnover rate in retail.
In 1993, when growing competition threatened both Price Club and Costco Wholesale, Sinegal was invited to a partial merger. The two companies entered into a partial merger just after Price’s earnings dropped to 40%. The new company, named PriceCostco, Inc., focused heavily on international expansion, opening stores in Mexico, South Korea, and England. Despite best efforts to recover losses, sales continued to drop. Robert Price and Jim Sinegal had different opinions regarding company direction and recovery policies. The breakup was formally announced in 1994. Price’s breakaway company was named as Price Enterprises. Sinegal still continued to manage PriceCostco, Inc.
In 1997, the name of Sinegal’s company was changed to Costco Wholesale.
In an interview published in the Houston Chronicle on July 17, 2005, he told Steven Greenhouse that he did not care about Wall Street analysts who had criticized him for putting good treatment of employees and customers ahead of pleasing shareholders. Investors might want higher earnings, but Sinegal stated, “We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now." A favorite quote attributed to Sinegal, in part about his philosophy on dealing with success, is, “you have to take the shit with the sugar”. Investors who bought $10,000 of Costco stock in 1992 found it worth $43,564 just ten years later (a return of 354% [15.855%, annually]). A 2012 CNBC documentary stated that from 1985 until Sinegal's retirement, the stock's value had increased by five thousand percent. Costco's two highest-sales years to date, were Sinegal's final two years as CEO.
In 2009, Sinegal was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[5][6]
On December 31, 2012, Sinegal retired, currently serves as Company Advisor and Director, and was succeeded by his long-term Costco colleague W. Craig Jelinek in 2012. [7]
Compensation[edit]
According to Costco's Proxy statement filed for 2011, Sinegal earned $350,000 in base pay, with additional funds coming from bonuses, stock/option awards and other compensations, totaling $2,191,159.[8] This amount does not reflect grants of plan-based awards, outstanding equity awards, or changes to other potential Costco-related holdings.
Personal life[edit]
In 2008, Sinegal was part of an eleventh-hour, local ownership group that committed to invest $450 million ($150 million from each of the three co-owners) for the renovation of Seattle's KeyArena, and to purchase the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics franchise.[9] The bid failed, however, as NBA commissioner David Stern—displeased that state and local taxpayers and politicians refused the NBA's demands that they pay for a new arena, in order to keep the team in Washington—had already made a private deal with an Oklahoma-based ownership group to move the team to Oklahoma City (where it was renamed the Oklahoma City Thunder).
Sinegal and his wife, Janet, have three children.[10] Sinegal's son, David Sinegal, owns and operates the Sinegal Estate Winery in St. Helena, CA.[11] Sinegal is an avowed Democrat,[12] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[13]

Jim Sinegal Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth           Celebrity Net Worth  Search Random  Jim Sinegal Net WorthHow much is Jim Sinegal Worth? in Richest Businessmen › CEOsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterRandom CelebrityJim Sinegal net worth:$2 BillionJim Sinegal's Salary$350 Thousand Per Year Costco mogul Jim Sinegal has an estimated net worth of $2 billion and a salary of $350,000 per year. Sinegal acquired his mammoth net worth as the founder and CEO of the largest membership retail chain in the United States. In the 1950's a young Sinegal found his vocation in retailing when he started as a bagger at FedMart, a discount retail membership store. Over the years, He climbed up the FedMart ladder becoming the executive vice president, overlooking the merchandising and operations. Sinegal went from strength to strength. In the 1970's he became the vice president (merchandising) for Builder Emporium and later took the position as the vice president for the Price Company. In 1983, Sinegal co-founded Costco with Seattle retailer Jeff Brotman. Sinegal turned Costco into one of the most popular discount warehouse in the U.S. Costco offers a wide range of services which spans from selling fresh fruits to offering eye care, clinics and pharmacies. Costco services also expand to gas stations, offering low-priced gas across the United States.A decade later, Costco merged with the pioneer of the warehouse discount concept, the Price Company. Since then, Costco has become one of the top ten retailers in the world – although there are less than 600 stores. Furthermore, Sinegal is considered one of the most prominent retail figures in American modern history. From the start, Sinegal has been the President and CEO of Costco – until now. On January 2012 (his 76th birthday), Sinegal will step down from the empire he build over 28 years. Costco's president and chief operating officer, Craig Jelinek will continue Sinegal's legacy. Jelinek joined Costco in 1984 as a warehouse manager and (years before) he was tipped to be the next CEO. Although he has plans to step down from Costco, Sinegal shows no signs of retiring, as he will be with the retail giant for another year. Sinegal will be involved with the company's transition.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
