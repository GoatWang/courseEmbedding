HAMMOND | Hammond native Karen Korellis Reuther was global creative director for one of the world's best known brands.For more than a decade, she was responsible for Nike's creative vision, overseeing the designs the $27.7 billion-a-year company used in new products and merchandising. Just name-dropping her employer, an S&P 500 titan recognized worldwide for its iconic swoosh, opened doors.But Reuther, a 1975 graduate of Hammond High School, decided to leave her dream job at Nike after she found the work no longer challenged or inspired her.
She discussed that decision to move on during a recent TEDx talk entitled "Leaving your Dream." TEDx is a prestigious series of conferences that present "ideas worth spreading" in talks of up to 18 minutes that have become hugely popular on YouTube."Are you considering leaving a dream? Here are some questions you might want to ask yourself: Are you getting too comfortable?" she asked a crowd of about 500 people at the conference in April."Are you only doing what you're an expert at? Have you started to believe your title is you? Are you thinking too much about the past? Are you worried too much about the future? Do you have the company logo tattooed on your ankle?"Reuther, the daughter of Northwest Indiana business legend and Korellis Roofing Inc. founder George Korellis, was selected by Berklee College of Music to be a speaker at TEDx Berklee Valencia in Spain. Her talk also addressed how her dad fulfilled his dream by creating one of the region's largest roofing companies and how she never wanted to leave her Hammond home.
"I'm just such a product and child of Hammond and Northwest Indiana," she said. "I love the fact my dad realized his dream. I was raised right in a good city and feel blessed for having grown up in the city during the time I did."Reuther, a Purdue University graduate, now lives in Boston. She's the creative director and brand psychologist for Cast, a design consultancy that has clients such as Puma and Pantone, and also an adjunct professor at Wentworth Institute of Technology.People always ask her why she would ever leave a job at Nike, which got her thinking about the idea of "love it and leave it" and inspired the theme for her TEDx talk. She's loved places she's lived and jobs she had but still needed to push herself out the door and on to the next opportunity, and knew she couldn't be alone in feeling that way.
She's long been a fan of TED talks, which she's attended in Portland, Cambrige and Boston. Reuther considers them such a wealth of information she even made a New Year's Resolution to watch one a week."It made it harder for me," she said. "My expectations were pretty high, and you want people to watch your video, so it added a little more healthy pressure for me."She prepared for two and a half months, and it was rigorous. Reuther Skyped with coaches in writing the script, which she had to memorize and deliver like it wasn't just a rote presentation. Reuther hopes her talk will inspire viewers."I hope people take away a confidence they can get to a point where they can love it and leave it," she said. "A dream doesn't have to last for an entire lifetime. When you leave your dreams, you're evolving, moving forward."
