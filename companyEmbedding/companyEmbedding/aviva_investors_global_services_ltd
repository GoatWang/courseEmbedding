Aviva Global Services completes the successful transfer of over 300 finance professionals from WNS Customer Solutions to Aviva







Aviva Global Services completes the successful transfer of over 300 finance professionals from WNS Customer Solutions to Aviva













03 Jul 2007
Creates BOT history once again in the IT/ITeS worldClose on the heels of its first successful transfer in Bangalore, India, Aviva Global Services has announced the successful transfer of over 300 accounting and finance professionals from WNS Customer Solutions in to Aviva Global Services in Colombo, on 2 July, 2007. Aviva Global Services (AGS) is the business process and IT outsourcing (BPO and ITO) arm of Aviva plc. Aviva - UK's largest Insurance company and the world's fifth largest - had previously announced its plans to grow to 7,800 BPO roles in the subcontinent by end 2008. Offshoring has always been a key component of Aviva's global growth strategy providing it with flexibility, productivity, process and cost efficiency while maintaining the high quality of customer servicing expected.Aviva has built the offshore BPO roles in partnership with three vendor partners - EXL, WNS and 24/7 Customer under the BOT model. Aviva is demonstrating its commitment to India and Sri Lanka by transferring over 4,500 of its third party BPO vendor staff to its own offshore division, Aviva Global Services over the course of the year 2007. This successful transfer marks a momentous achievement as the sheer size and scale of such a transfer is unique to the IT / ITeS industry across India and Sri Lanka.Cathryn Riley, chair AGS, based in UK, quoted: "This is a moment of great pride for both Aviva plc and AGS, as we welcome our colleagues in Sri Lanka in to the Aviva family. As planned, the transition has been seamless and transparent to the UK business units, our employees and also to end customers."Rajnish Virmani, CEO, Aviva Global Services, said: "This successfully executed transfer will serve as a great learning, and indeed is a matter of great pride for us. The build and transfer of operation in Sri Lanka marks a critical step in the execution of a well laid-out off shoring strategy for Aviva. A critical success factor in this journey has been the close relationship we enjoy with WNS and they will continue to run our Legal Services division here in Colombo. The BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) contract with them has enabled Aviva to ramp up rapidly and gain ‘speed to market'." Speaking of the transfer, Eric Selvadurai, CEO, Enterprise Services, WNS Global Services, said: "WNS is proud of our association with Aviva Global Services, and are extremely pleased that our BOT contract delivered the promised efficiencies. The Sri Lanka centre, housing a ‘finance and accounting centre of excellence' is a world class operation, and we were committed to managing a smooth transition."The Aviva operations in Colombo will house the "finance and accounting centre of excellence" and will boast of a team of about 300 highly qualified finance and accounting professionals most of who are either in the process of acquiring their CIMA/ACCA certification or are already CIMA/ACCA certified professionals. Next only to UK, Colombo has the rare distinction of producing the highest number of CIMA/ACCA certified finance and accounting professionals in the world, and was therefore the natural choice of destination for the finance and accounting centre of excellence. The Lanka operations cater to Aviva's business units as a captive knowledge process outsourcing unit providing high-end finance and accounting services to Norwich Union Life, Norwich Union Insurance and Aviva Corporate Finance."We are proud to become a part of the Aviva family. Over the last three years, we have been focused on successfully delivering to the stringent performance metrics and service level agreements. Aviva has been extremely supportive and happy with the performance delivered by the Colombo centre. We are geared up to ensure that we relentlessly pursue the agenda of delivering excellence in everything we do," said Kalum Katipearachchi, country director of Aviva Global Services Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. "With the establishment of a financial and accounting centre of excellence owned and managed by a world class company, the benefits to the country include; the provision of professional employment, the investing in and the continuous development of skills and training for employment, as well as foreign revenue," he further stated. -ends-Press contacts: AvivaAnuja AgarwalHead of CommunicationAviva Global Services, India and Sri LankaE-mail: anuja.agarwal@avivags.com Telephone: +91 98220 91002 Sheranga SenanayakeManager, CommunicationAviva Global Services, Lanka, Pvt LtdE-mail: sheranga.senanayake@avivags.com Telephone: +94 77 392 5553WNSSmita GaikwadE-mail: smita.gaikwad@wnsgs.comTelephone: + 91 98201 22336Notes to the editor:About AvivaAviva is the leading provider of life and pensions to Europe with substantial positions in other markets around the world, making it the world's fifth largest insurance group based on gross worldwide premiums at 31 December 2005.

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
