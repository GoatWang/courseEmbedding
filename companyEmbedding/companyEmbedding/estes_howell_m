Biography[edit]
Estes was born in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1936 and began his military career at Fort Bliss, Texas. He was appointed platoon and troop commanding officer of the 7th Cavalry, and later was assigned to Headquarters 1st Cavalry Division, as aide to the commanding general. He entered pilot training school in June 1939. Upon graduation in April 1940, he transferred to the Army Air Corps and subsequently was assigned as a flight instructor at Brooks Field, Texas.
In August he was appointed commandant of cadets at the Brooks Field Advanced Flying School. He became director of flying for the school in July 1942 and was redesignated director of training the following year. In February 1944, he assumed command of Blackland Army Air Base, Waco, Texas. With the closing of Blackland, he assumed command of Lubbock Army Air Field at Lubbock, Texas in July 1944.
In January 1946, Estes became chief of the Plans and Policy Branch, Operations Division, U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), at Wiesbaden, Germany. He was named chief of the plans section, Operations Division in April and three months later was designated deputy assistant chief of staff, operations. In November 1947 he became assistant chief of staff, plans, at USAFE.
Estes returned to the United States and in June 1949 completed courses at the Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. He was then assigned to March Air Force Base, California, where he assumed command of the 1st Air Base Group and shortly thereafter became deputy commander and chief of staff, 22d Bombardment Wing and later became commander of the wing. In January 1951, he became commander of the 44th Bombardment Wing at March Air Force Base.
During the Korean War, Estes was on temporary duty overseas from March to July 1951 as vice commander of the Far East Air Forces Bomber Command. During that time, he flew 25 combat missions over Korea with a total of 328 hours in B-29s.

In October, as an additional duty, he was designated commander, Air Task Group 7.4, Joint Task Force Seven, for the overseas atomic test, Operation Castle. He relinquished command of the 12th Air Division in July 1953 and took active command of Air Task Group 7.4.

Estes was assigned as Director of Weapon Systems Operations, Wright Air Development Center of the Air Research and Development Command (ARDC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in July 1954.

General Howell M. Estes, III Joins SpaceDev Board of Directors

                Press Release
                From: SpaceDev, Inc. 
                Posted: Wednesday, April 4, 2001            


                
                SpaceDev Inc.
, the world's first publicly-traded commercial space
exploration and development company, today announced that General
Howell M. Estes, III (USAF Retired) has joined SpaceDev's Board of
Directors.
General Estes retired from the United States Air Force in 1998
after serving for 33 years. At that time he was the Commander-in-Chief
of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (CINCNORAD) and the
United States Space Command (CINCSPACE), and the Commander of the Air
Force Space Command (COMAFSPC) headquartered at Peterson AFB, Colo. In
addition to a Bachelor of Science Degree from the Air Force Academy,
he holds a Master of Arts Degree in Public Administration from Auburn
University and is a graduate of the Program for Senior Managers in
Government at Harvard's JFK School of Government.
``We are very honored that General Estes has joined our Board,''
said Jim Benson, chairman and CEO of SpaceDev. ``General Estes is both
a hero and a visionary who has spent many years advocating increased
investment in space and closer ties with the commercial space sector
because of the importance of space to our national security. I believe
he will be able to help us match SpaceDev business goals and technical
capabilities with current and future needs of our nation, and with
those who will be making important space-related decisions over the
next several years.''
``I believe the next five to 10 years will see exciting, new
opportunities in space, both commercial and government, for which
SpaceDev is well positioned,'' commented General Estes. ``I look forward
to working with the other Board members to fully develop these
opportunities, while at the same time helping in some manner to
maintain our country's leadership role in space.''
Gen. Howell Estes is the President of Howell Estes & Associates
Inc., a wholly owned consulting firm to CEOs, Presidents and General
Managers of aerospace and telecommunications companies worldwide. He
serves as vice chairman of the Board of Trustees at The Aerospace
Corp. He served as a consultant to the Defense Science Board Task
Force on SPACE SUPERIORITY and more recently as a commissioner on the
U.S. Congressional Commission to Assess United States National
Security Space Management and Organization (the ``Rumsfeld
Commission'').

Biography[edit]
Estes was born in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1936 and began his military career at Fort Bliss, Texas. He was appointed platoon and troop commanding officer of the 7th Cavalry, and later was assigned to Headquarters 1st Cavalry Division, as aide to the commanding general. He entered pilot training school in June 1939. Upon graduation in April 1940, he transferred to the Army Air Corps and subsequently was assigned as a flight instructor at Brooks Field, Texas.
In August he was appointed commandant of cadets at the Brooks Field Advanced Flying School. He became director of flying for the school in July 1942 and was redesignated director of training the following year. In February 1944, he assumed command of Blackland Army Air Base, Waco, Texas. With the closing of Blackland, he assumed command of Lubbock Army Air Field at Lubbock, Texas in July 1944.
In January 1946, Estes became chief of the Plans and Policy Branch, Operations Division, U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), at Wiesbaden, Germany. He was named chief of the plans section, Operations Division in April and three months later was designated deputy assistant chief of staff, operations. In November 1947 he became assistant chief of staff, plans, at USAFE.
Estes returned to the United States and in June 1949 completed courses at the Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. He was then assigned to March Air Force Base, California, where he assumed command of the 1st Air Base Group and shortly thereafter became deputy commander and chief of staff, 22d Bombardment Wing and later became commander of the wing. In January 1951, he became commander of the 44th Bombardment Wing at March Air Force Base.
During the Korean War, Estes was on temporary duty overseas from March to July 1951 as vice commander of the Far East Air Forces Bomber Command. During that time, he flew 25 combat missions over Korea with a total of 328 hours in B-29s.
He assumed command of the 320th Bombardment Wing at March Air Force Base in August 1951 and was named commander of the 12th Air Division in 1952. In October, as an additional duty, he was designated commander, Air Task Group 7.4, Joint Task Force Seven, for the overseas atomic test, Operation Castle. He relinquished command of the 12th Air Division in July 1953 and took active command of Air Task Group 7.4. During the operational phase of Operation Castle in 1954, he spent four months at the Pacific Proving Grounds on Eniwetok Atoll.
Estes was assigned as Director of Weapon Systems Operations, Wright Air Development Center of the Air Research and Development Command (ARDC), Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in July 1954. This directorate was transferred to the Office of the Deputy Commander for Weapon Systems, ARDC in August 1955, and became known as Detachment 1 at which time Estes became assistant deputy commander for weapon systems, Headquarters ARDC and commander, Detachment 1.
Estes was transferred to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., as the Assistant Chief of Staff, Air Defense Systems, in August 1957, and was reassigned as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, in June 1958. In April 1961, Estes became the deputy commander for aerospace systems, Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), in Los Angeles, California, and in October 1962, he became vice commander of AFSC at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.
