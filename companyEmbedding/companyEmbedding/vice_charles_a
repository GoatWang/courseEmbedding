About An Unnatural Vice
In the sordid streets of Victorian London, unwanted desire flares between two bitter enemies brought together by a deadly secret. Crusading journalist Nathaniel Roy is determined to expose spiritualists who exploit the grief of bereaved and vulnerable people. First on his list is the so-called Seer of London, Justin Lazarus. Nathaniel expects him to be a cheap, heartless fraud. He doesn’t expect to meet a man with a sinful smile and the eyes of a fallen angel—or that a shameless swindler will spark his desires for the first time in years. Justin feels no remorse for the lies he spins during his séances. His gullible clients simply bore him. Hostile, disbelieving, utterly irresistible Nathaniel is a fascinating challenge. And as their battle of wills and wits heats up, Justin finds he can’t stop thinking about the man who’s determined to ruin him. But Justin and Nathaniel are linked by more than their fast-growing obsession with one another. They are both caught up in an aristocratic family’s secrets, and Justin holds information that could be lethal. As killers, fanatics, and fog close in, Nathaniel is the only man Justin can trust—and, perhaps, the only man he could love. Don’t miss any of the captivating Sins of the Cities novels: AN UNSEEN ATTRACTION | AN UNNATURAL VICE And look for the Society of Gentlemen series by K. J. Charles: A FASHIONABLE INDULGENCE | THE RUIN OF GABRIEL ASHLEIGH | A SEDITIOUS AFFAIR | A GENTLEMAN’S POSITION  Praise for An Unnatural Vice“Explosive.”—Publishers Weekly “Animosity and attraction surge in equal measures when Nathaniel Roy, investigative journalist, faces off against Justin Lazarus, the Seer of London. Their opposing vocations and radically different backgrounds create a powerful and fascinating conflict. Although this book can be read as a stand-alone, [K. J.] Charles continues to build tension and add menace by deepening the overarching mystery introduced in the first novel. The series is definitely building to a firecracker conclusion.”—RT Book Reviews “An Unnatural Vice is a well-developed, entertaining romance that left me breathless. . . . Keep these historical romances coming, Charles!”—The Book Corps  “An Unnatural Vice is a tremendous follow-up to the first book in the Sins of the City trilogy. Fans of the series—and of K. J. Charles—will love the romance between Nathaniel and Justin, and the Taillefer family mystery. . . . An Unnatural Vice is exciting, entertaining, romantic—and wonderful.”—All About Romance “A real tour de force. The mystery of the missing Taillefer heir is smoothly and skillfully woven through Justin and Nathaniel’s love story and the ending brilliantly sets up the next book. . . . The real heart of the book is the complicated, messy but glorious romance between two bitter enemies. An Unnatural Vice is a must-read and I can’t recommend it highly enough.”—Romantic Historical Reviews “An Unnatural Vice is a thrilling, achingly romantic story. Nathaniel and Justin have both undergone serious trauma in their lives, and Charles digs into their respective psychologies with piercing insight. . . . With expertly paced action sequences and the evocative setting of fog-drenched Victorian London, An Unnatural Vice is the rare historical romance that is both transportive and immediate.”—BookPage  Includes an excerpt from another Loveswept title.

The series is definitely building to a firecracker conclusion.”—RT Book Reviews“This is another wonderful story by an author whose work I just adore. Charles sets things up wonderfully for the next book in the series and I particularly loved how the suspense plot is integrated into this story. [She gives us] a chance to connect with many of the characters we meet in the first book, while also introducing a fabulous new relationship and furthering the larger mystery. . . .
