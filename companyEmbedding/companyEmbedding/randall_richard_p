Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity. Fidelity does not endorse or adopt their content.  Fidelity makes no guarantees that information supplied is accurate, complete, or timely, and does not provide any warranties regarding results obtained from their use.Any data, charts and other information provided on this page are intended for research purposes to help self-directed investors evaluate many types of securities including, but not limited to common stocks, American Depository Receipts, Master Limited Partnerships, real estate investment trusts. traditional preferred stock, trust preferred securities, third-party trust certificates, convertible securities, mandatory convertible securities and other exchange-traded equity and/or debt securities.

			Richard P. Randall has served as a director of the Company since April 2006 and has served on the Company's Audit Committee, as its Chair, since 2006, and on the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee since September 2008. Mr. Randall has decades of business experience, including tenures as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of both publicly traded and privately held companies in the retail industry, including Direct Holdings Worldwide, LLC, the parent company of Lillian Vernon Corp. and Time-Life, a music and video marketing company, and, prior thereto, Coach, Inc., a luxury leather goods company. Mr. Randall possesses extensive knowledge of accounting and finance, the retail industry and the issues impacting a publicly traded company. Mr. Randall has extensive executive level experience establishing his capabilities in management of complex organizations and is a certified public accountant. His expertise in finance qualifies him to serve as the Audit Committee "audit committee financial expert" and his service on the boards and board committees of other companies has allowed him to gain broad-based experience and sensitivity regarding best practices, which he shares with the Board. Mr. Randall also provides a perspective on proper governance for public companies. He currently serves as a member of the board of directors and Audit Committee of P&F Industries, Inc., a manufacturer and importer of tools sold principally to the industrial, retail and automotive markets, as well as residential hardware and, until December 31, 2014, served as a member of the board of directors and chair of the Audit and Risk Committee of Aceto Corporation, a generic pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and chemical distribution company. Mr. Randall is a former director and member of the Executive, Finance, Audit and Research Committees of The Burke Rehabilitation Hospital ("Burke"). He currently serves as a Member Emeritus of Burke's Executive Committee and retains a board seat on The Burke Foundation's board. Mr. Randall served as a director and chair of the Audit Committee of Universal Travel Group, a travel services provider in the People's Republic of China, and of Home Systems Group, a manufacturer and distributor of household appliances in the People's Republic of China, from 2007 until 2008 when he resigned from these boards.

Rick, Denell, Kayla,...Words feel so inadequate in letting you know the sorrow we feel at this time.  So many sweet memories of times spent with you and your family over the years.   I'll never forget the times in Baton Rouge at Galilee Baptist Church, camping at Clear Springs when Kayla was a tyke, BBQ'ing at the house in Sherrington Place, moving that old school cabinet from your house to our house in BR then to NE then back to LA, Rick staying with my kids when Jack was born, watching Ricky ride his new motorcycle in the pasture, stomping on that cut worm in the garden that splattered on Ricky's foot and listening to him howl,....so many sweet memories.   You and your family have always been and will always be special to us.    I wish there was some way to take away the pain.    We love you and will be here to support you any way we can.

Ricky-Our family will never be the same without you at the dinner table. You were/are a precious soul. I'm so thankful that the last time we were together that I was able to tell you how proud of you I was. WE are so very proud of the person you had become. Your sweet and funny nature will always be etched into our hearts and I can't even begin to express how broken we are that you're gone. I know that you have good company where you're at, but we'll always wish we had more time. We'll always feel like it was stolen, but we know our love has no boundaries and reaches you. You are missed every second and will be every day. I love you and miss you so much already. Love your cousin, "Brookie"
