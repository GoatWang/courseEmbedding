Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Due to market volatility, current performance may be less or higher than the figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that upon redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance figures for all Funds reflect contractual waivers and/or expense limitations, without which total returns may have been lower. These limitations may be modified or terminated only with Board approval.

MainStay Conservative Allocation Fund, MainStay Growth Allocation Fund, MainStay Moderate Growth Allocation Fund, and MainStay Moderate Allocation Fund: The Fund is a "fund of funds" that invests in shares of other mutual funds within the MainStay Family of Funds (the underlying funds).

Investment Definitions
POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.
Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses.

Disclosure
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.
Capital gains distributions are a distribution a mutual fund makes out of profits from selling stocks or bonds that is subject to capital gains taxes for the shareholders. The ex-date is when a distribution of dividends and capital gains is deducted from a mutual fund's assets. It is then set aside for payment to the shareholders. The payable date is the date when the declared dividend or capital gain distribution is scheduled to be paid to shareholders who elected to receive cash payments.
Short-term capital gains are a gain on an investment that has been held for one year or less.
Long-term capital gains are a gain on an investment that has been held for more than one year.
