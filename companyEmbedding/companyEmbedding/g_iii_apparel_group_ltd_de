	G-III APPAREL GROUP, LTD. ANNOUNCES
	FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2018 RESULTS




	 




	—  Net Sales Increase
	16% to First Quarter Record of $529 million —




	 




	—  


	G-III
	Increases Full-Year Net Sales and Net Income Guidance —




	 



	New York, New York
	– June 6, 2017 — G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NasdaqGS: GIII) today announced operating results for the first quarter
	of fiscal 2018 that ended April 30, 2017.


	 


	For the quarter ended
	April 30, 2017, G-III reported that net sales increased 16% to a first quarter record of $529.0 million compared to $457.4 million
	in the year-ago period. The Company reported a net loss for the first quarter of $10.4 million, or $(0.21) loss per share, compared
	to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the prior year’s comparable period.


	 


	On an adjusted basis,
	for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding (i) professional fees and severance of $1.1 million related to the acquisition
	of Donna Karan International (“DKI”) and (ii) non-cash imputed interest expense of $1.4 million related to the note
	issued to seller as part of the consideration for the acquisition of DKI, equal to $0.03 per share, non-GAAP net loss per share
	for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(0.18) compared to net income per share of $0.06 in the prior year’s comparable
	period.


	 


	Included in both GAAP
	and non-GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are operating losses of $14.8 million and additional cash interest expense
	of $7.3 million related to the operation and ownership of DKI, equal to an aggregate of $0.29 per share. The acquisition of DKI
	was completed on December 1, 2016.

	Morris Goldfarb, G-III’s
	Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our wholesale business continues its strong growth and demonstrates the power
	of our brand portfolio to transcend a difficult market environment and retain a leadership position as one of the most high-performing
	vendors for our retail customers. Offsetting our strong wholesale performance were the previously forecasted losses with respect
	to our own retail stores and the development of the Donna Karan business.”


	 


	Mr. Goldfarb continued,
	“We are reducing operating costs in our retail business, closing and repurposing stores and enhancing our store product offerings,
	all which are intended to help us significantly reduce the losses in our retail operations.”


	 


	Mr. Goldfarb concluded,
	“We are approaching an inflection point for the Donna Karan business where our efforts are expected to yield profitable results
	for this business in the second half of this fiscal year. Overall, we believe that we are in a renewed position to drive higher
	levels of growth, investment returns and value to customers, consumers and shareholders.”


	 



	Outlook



	 



	The
	Company today increased its prior guidance for the full fiscal 2018 year ending January 31, 2018. The Company now expects net sales
	of approximately $2.76 billion and net income between $52 million and $57 million, or between $1.04 and $1.14 per diluted share.
	T

	he Company previously forecasted net sales of approximately $2.73 billion and net income between $40 million and $45 million,
	or between $0.80 and $0.90 per diluted share.


	 



	The
	Company’s forecast includes Donna Karan-related transitional expenses of $7 million and non-cash imputed interest expense
	of $6 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding transitional expenses and imputed interest expense, the Company is forecasting non-GAAP
	net income between approximately $60 million and $65 million, or between $1.20 and $1.30 per diluted share. T

	he Company’s
	previous forecast was for non-GAAP net income between approximately $49 million and $54 million, or between $0.99 and $1.09 per
	diluted share.


	 


	The forecasted GAAP
	and non-GAAP results reflect expected operating losses of $21 million and additional interest expense of $28 million, equal to
	an aggregate of $0.62 per diluted


	 






	 



	2



	 









	 


	 


	 






	 


	share, associated with
	the Donna Karan business. The forecast also includes the full year impact of the issuance of approximately 2.6 million shares of
	new G-III common stock to the seller of DKI.


	 



	The
	Company is now forecasting projected full-year adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 between $178 million and $186 million compared to
	adjusted EBITDA of $148.1 million in fiscal 2017 and compared to its previous forecast of adjusted EBITDA

	between $162 million
	and $171 million

	. This adjusted EBITDA guidance includes a forecasted full-year operating loss
	of approximately $11 million associated with the Donna Karan business.



	 


	The Company continues
	to anticipate that it will incur losses from the Donna Karan operations during the first half of fiscal 2018 that will be partially
	offset by operating profitability beginning in the third quarter as the Company commences shipments of DKNY and Donna Karan products
	produced by G-III in connection with the launch of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands.


	 


	For the second fiscal
	quarter ending July 31, 2018, the Company is forecasting net sales of approximately $520 million and a net loss between $15 million
	and $20 million, or between ($0.30) and ($0.40) per share. This forecast compares to net sales of $442 million and a net loss of
	$1.3 million, or ($0.03) per share, reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.


	 



	The
	second quarter forecast assumes Donna Karan related transitional expenses of $3.0 million and non-cash imputed interest expense
	of $1.4 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding transitional and imputed interest expenses, the Company is forecasting a second
	quarter non-GAAP net loss between $12 million and $17 million, or between $(0.24) and $(0.34) per share.

	The Company’s
	results for the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2016 included $3.0 million of professional fees in connection with its acquisition
	of Donna Karan. On an adjusted basis, excluding the professional fees, the Company reported non-GAAP net income of $461,000, or
	$0.01 per diluted share, in the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016.



	 



	The forecasted GAAP
	and non-GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflect expected operating losses of approximately $17 million and additional
	cash interest expense of approximately $10 million, equal to an aggregate of $0.35 per share, associated with the Donna

	Karan business. The forecast
	also includes the full impact of the issuance of approximately 2.6 million shares of new G-III common stock to the seller of the
	Donna Karan business.


	 



	Non-GAAP Financial
	Measures



	 


	Reconciliations of
	GAAP net income (loss) per share to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA are presented
	in tables accompanying the condensed financial statements included in this release and provide useful information to evaluate the
	Company’s operational performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in light
	of the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

	Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per
	share is a “non-GAAP financial measure” that excludes acquisition related professional fees, non-cash imputed interest
	expense and Donna Karan related transitional expenses, which are comprised primarily of severance expenses, in connection with
	the acquisition of DKI, as well as asset impairments related to the retail operations segment in fiscal 2017. Income tax impacts
	of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the effective tax rates for the respective period. Management believes that this non-GAAP
	financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding acquisition-related expenses
	and asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 related to our retail operations segment that are not indicative of our core business
	operating results. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to assess our performance on a comparative basis and believes
	that it is also useful to investors to enable them to assess our performance on a comparative basis across historical periods and
	facilitate comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. The presentation of this financial information is
	not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented
	in accordance with GAAP.

	Adjusted EBITDA is a “non-GAAP financial

	tax expense and excludes professional fees and Donna Karan related transitional expenses, which are comprised primarily of severance
	expenses, as well as asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 related to our retail operations segment. Adjusted EBITDA is being
	presented as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is a common measure of operating performance in the
	apparel industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s
	operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company’s liquidity,
	as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS



	 



	Note 1 – Basis of Presentation



	 


	As used in these financial statements, the
	term “Company” or “G-III” refers to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. The Company designs,
	manufactures and markets an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits
	and women’s performance wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories
	and luggage. The Company also operates retail stores.


	 


	The Company consolidates the accounts of all
	its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. KL North America BV (“KLNA”) is a Dutch limited liability company
	that is a joint venture that is 49% owned by the Company. Kingdom Holdings 1 B.V. (“KH1”) is a Dutch limited liability
	company that is 19% owned by the Company. These investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All material
	intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Vilebrequin International SA (“Vilebrequin”), a Swiss
	corporation that is wholly-owned by the Company, KH1 and KLNA report results on a calendar year basis rather than on the January
	31 fiscal year basis used by the Company. Our retail stores use a 52/53-week fiscal year.


	 


	The results for the three month period ended
	April 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the entire fiscal year, given the seasonal nature of
	the Company’s business. The accompanying financial statements included herein are unaudited. All adjustments (consisting
	of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash
	flows for the interim period presented have been reflected.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements should
	be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).


	 


	The Company’s international subsidiaries
	use different functional currencies, which are the local selling currency. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, operating
	assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated from foreign currency into U.S. dollars at period-end
	rates, while income and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the period. The related translation
	adjustments are reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’
	equity.




	 





	Note 2 – Acquisition of Donna Karan International



	 


	On December 1, 2016, G-III acquired all
	of the outstanding capital stock of Donna Karan International Inc. (“DKI”) from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc.
	(“LVMH”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated July 22, 2016, as amended,
	by and between the Company and LVMH, for a total purchase price of approximately $669.8 million.


	 


	DKI owns some of the world’s most
	iconic and recognizable power brands including Donna Karan and DKNY. DKI sells its products through department stores, specialty
	and online retailers worldwide, as well as through company-owned retail stores and an e-commerce site. The acquisition of DKI
	strengthens and diversifies the Company’s brand portfolio and offers additional opportunities to expand G-III’s business
	through the development of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands and product categories.


	 


	The results of DKI have been included in
	these consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

	The Company initially recognized
	goodwill of approximately $220.6 million in connection with the acquisition of DKI. In the quarter ended April 30, 2017, the Company
	reduced goodwill by $2.7 million due to unrecorded indemnification assets from LVMH related to transactions that occurred prior
	to the acquisition. There was no change to the purchase price, however, the estimates of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
	assumed are preliminary and subject to change based on finalizing the election under Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10)
	which may have an impact on purchase price.

	The goodwill was assigned
	to the Company’s wholesale operations reporting unit as the wholesale operations reporting unit is expected to benefit from
	the synergies of the combination and from the future growth of DKI. Subsequent to the acquisition, DKI’s wholesale operations
	were fully integrated into G-III’s credit and collection platform and both entities are expected to share several processes
	in the short term such as IT, finance, logistics, human resources, sourcing and overseas quality control. The Purchase Agreement
	included an option to make an election under Internal Revenue Code Section 338(h)(10). Accordingly, the book and tax basis of
	the acquired assets and liabilities are the same as of the purchase date and the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over
	a 15 year period.


	The fair values assigned to
	identifiable intangible assets acquired were based on assumptions and estimates made by management using unobservable inputs reflecting
	the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based
	on the best information available. The fair values of these identifiable intangible assets were determined using the discounted
	cash flow method and the Company classifies these intangibles as Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company recorded other intangible
	assets of  $410.0 million, which included customer relationships of  $40.0 million (17 year life), as well as tradenames
	of  $370.0 million, which have an indefinite life.




	The results of DKI have been included in these
	consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.


	 



	Note 3 – Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates



	 


	In February 2016, the Company acquired
	a 19% minority interest in KH1, the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. The
	Company paid 32.5€ million (approximately $35.4 million at the date of the transaction). This investment is intended to expand
	the partnership between the Company and the Karl Lagerfeld brand and extend their business development opportunities on a global
	scale. The investment in KH1, which is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting, is reflected in Investment in
	Unconsolidated Affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at April 30, 2017.

	(determined by the first-in, first out method) or net realizable value which comprises a significant portion of the
	Company’s inventory. Retail inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory
	method. Vilebrequin inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the weighted average method) or net

	Note 5 – Net Income (Loss) per Common Share



	 


	Basic net income (loss) per common share has
	been computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per share,
	when applicable, is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potential dilutive common shares, consisting
	of unvested restricted stock awards and stock options outstanding during the period. In addition, all share based payments outstanding
	that vest based on the achievement of performance and/or market price conditions, and for which the respective performance and/or
	market price conditions have not been achieved, have been excluded from the diluted per share calculation. Approximately 510,800
	shares of common stock have been excluded from the diluted net income per share calculation for the three months ended April 30,
	2016. For the three months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, 14,275 and 19,200 shares of common stock, respectively, were issued in
	connection with the exercise or vesting of equity awards.

	Term Loan



	 


	In connection with the acquisition of DKI,
	the Company borrowed $350.0 million under a senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan will
	mature in December 2022. The Term Loan was subject to amortization payments of 0.625% of the original aggregate principal
	amount of the Term Loan per quarter, with the balance due at maturity. On December 1, 2016, the Company prepaid $50.0 million
	in principal amount of the Term Loan. This prepayment relieved G-III of its obligation to make quarterly amortization payments
	for the remainder of the term.


	 


	Interest on the outstanding principal amount
	of the Term Loan accrues at a rate equal to LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus an applicable margin of 5.25% or an alternate base
	rate (defined as the greatest of  (i) the “prime rate” as published by the Wall Street Journal from time to
	time, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the LIBOR rate for a borrowing with an interest period of one month) plus
	4.25%, per annum, payable in cash.


	 


	The Term Loan is secured by certain assets
	of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Term Loan contains covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to among
	other things, incur additional debt, sell or dispose certain assets, make certain investments, incur liens and enter into acquisitions.
	This loan also includes a mandatory prepayment provision on excess cash flow as defined within the agreement. A first lien leverage
	covenant requires the Company to maintain a level of debt to EBITDA at a ratio as defined over the term of the agreement. As of
	April 30, 2017 the Company was in compliance with this covenant.



	 




	New Revolving Credit Facility



	 


	Upon closing of the acquisition of DKI,
	the Company’s previous credit agreement (the “old revolving credit facility”) was refinanced and replaced by
	a $650 million amended and restated credit agreement (the “new revolving credit facility”). Amounts available under
	the new revolving credit facility are subject to borrowing base formulas and over advances as specified in the new revolving credit
	facility agreement. Borrowings bear interest, at the Company’s option, at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% or an alternate
	base rate (defined as the greatest of  (i) the “prime rate” of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. from time to time,
	(ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the LIBOR rate for a borrowing with an interest period of one month) plus a margin
	of 0.25% to 0.75%, with the applicable margin determined based on the availability under the new revolving credit facility agreement.
	The new revolving credit facility has a five year term ending December 1, 2021. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding
	borrowings under the new revolving credit facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the credit
	agreement with respect to the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee accrues at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum on the average
	daily amount of the unutilized available commitment.


	 


	As of April 30, 2017, the Company
	had $120.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the new revolving credit facility all of which are classified as long term liabilities.
	As of April 30, 2017, there were outstanding trade and standby letters of credit amounting to $9.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively.



	 




	LVMH Note



	 


	As part of the consideration for the acquisition
	of DKI, the Company issued to LVMH a junior lien secured promissory note in the principal amount of  $125.0 million (the
	“LVMH Note”) that bears interest at the rate of 2% per year. $75.0 million of the principal amount of the LVMH Note
	is due and payable on June 1, 2023 and $50.0 million of such principal amount is due and payable on December 1, 2023.
	ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements requires the note to be recorded at fair value. As a result, the company recorded a debt discount
	in the amount of $40.0 million. This discount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method
	over the term of the LVMH Note.


	 



	Prior Revolving Credit Facility



	 


	Prior to the acquisition of DKI, the prior
	revolving credit facility consisted of a five-year senior secured credit facility providing for borrowings in the aggregate principal
	amount of up to $450 million through August 2017. Amounts available under the prior credit agreement were subject to borrowing
	base formulas and other advances as specified in that credit agreement. Borrowings bore interest, at the Company’s option,
	at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.0% or prime plus a margin of 0.5% to 1.0%, with the applicable margin determined based on availability
	under the previous credit agreement.

	Note 7 – Segments



	 


	The Company’s reportable segments
	are business units that offer products through different channels of distribution. The Company has two reportable segments: wholesale
	operations and retail operations. The wholesale operations segment includes sales of products under brands licensed by the Company
	from third parties, as well as sales of products under the Company’s own brands and private label brands. Wholesale sales
	and revenues from license agreements related to the Donna Karan and DKNY business are included in the wholesale operations segment.
	The retail operations segment consists primarily of the Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY stores, as well as a limited number
	of Calvin Klein Performance and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores.

	Note 8 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 



	Accounting Guidance Issued Being Evaluated
	for Adoption



	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,
	“Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” The purpose of
	ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.
	The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2019, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed
	on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect ASU 2017-04 to have an impact on its consolidated financial
	statements.

	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,
	“Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business.” The purpose of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify
	the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or
	disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
	periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early adoption
	is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2017-01 to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,
	“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The update requires an entity to
	recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset upon transfer other than inventory, eliminating the
	current recognition exception. Prior to the update, GAAP prohibited the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intra-entity
	asset transfers until the asset was sold to an outside party. The amendments in this update do not include new disclosure requirements;
	however, existing disclosure requirements might be applicable when accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an
	intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.
	The Company does not expect ASU 2016-16 to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
	“Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which clarifies guidance
	with respect to the classification of eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 was issued to reduce diversity in practice and
	prevent financial statement restatements. Cash flow issues include: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of
	zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance
	claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions
	received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows
	and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Under the provision, entities must apply the guidance
	retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. The
	Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-15.


	 


	In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,
	“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.” The guidance
	clarifies two aspects of Topic 606: (i) identifying performance obligations and (ii) providing licensing implementation guidance,
	while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers
	to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity’s promise to grant a license
	provides a customer with either a right to use the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time)
	or a right to access the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this update are
	intended to render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation of reducing the degree of judgment necessary to comply
	with Topic 606. The FASB continues to clarify this guidance and most recently issued ASU 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent
	Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),” ASU 2016-12, “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,”
	and ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” These
	new standards have the same effective date as ASU 2014-09 and will be effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively
	to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially
	applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company has
	not yet determined which method it will utilize. The Company has formed a committee that is evaluating the potential differences
	that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to the current accounting policies and practices. Based on
	this initial assessment and the actions the Committee is currently undertaking to implement the new guidance, the Company currently
	believes that the adoption of Topic 606 will primarily impact its wholesale operations segment in the timing of recognition of
	certain adjustments that are currently recorded in net sales along with reclassifications of certain operating expenses such as
	cooperative advertising, which is currently recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses but will be recorded as an
	offset to net sales under the new guidance. The Company believes that the retail operations segment will not be materially impacted
	by the new guidance, as its retail stores do not currently offer significant loyalty programs to their customers. However, these
	assessments may be subject to change.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
	“Leases (Topic 842).” The primary difference between the current requirement under GAAP and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition
	of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee
	recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
	representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term
	lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to
	adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to
	be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating
	leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification
	will be based on criteria that are for the most part similar to those applied in current lease accounting. ASU 2016-02 may be adopted
	using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transactions will require application
	of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The guidance is effective for public entities
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements and expects that
	it will result in a significant increase to its long-term assets and liabilities.


	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
	“Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
	Financial Liabilities.” This standard modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value


	 






	 



	11



	 









	 

	Table of Contents



	 


	 






	 


	of financial liabilities; simplifies the
	impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify
	impairment; changes presentation and disclosure requirements; and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation
	allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred
	tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those
	fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant
	impact on its statement of operations.




	  










	Item 2.






	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.






	 


	Unless the context otherwise requires,
	“G-III”, “us”, “we” and “our” refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
	References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ending January
	31, 2018 is referred to as “fiscal 2018”. Vilebrequin, KH1 and KLNA report results on a calendar year basis rather
	than on the January 31 fiscal year basis used by G-III. Accordingly, the results of Vilebrequin, KH1 and KLNA are and will be included
	in our financial statements for the quarter ended or ending closest to G-III’s fiscal quarter. For example, in this Form
	10-Q for the three month period ended April 30, 2017, the results of Vilebrequin, KH1 and KLNA are included for the three month
	period ended March 31, 2017. We account for our investment in KLNA and KH1 using the equity method of accounting.


	 


	The operating results of Donna Karan International
	Inc. have been included in our financial statements since December 1, 2016, the date of acquisition.


	 


	Various statements contained in this Form
	10-Q, in future filings by us with the SEC, in our press releases and in oral statements made from time to time by us or on our
	behalf constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of

	phrases and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements
	to be materially different from the future results, performance or achievements expressed in or implied by such forward-looking
	statements. Forward-looking statements also include representations of our expectations or beliefs concerning future events that

	Overview



	 


	G-III designs, manufactures and markets
	an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance
	wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. We sell our products
	under our own proprietary brands, which include DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Weejuns, Andrew Marc, Marc New York,
	Eliza J and Jessica Howard, as well as under licensed brands and private retail labels.


	 


	We sell products under an extensive portfolio
	of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Docker’s, Kenneth Cole,
	Cole Haan and Guess?. In our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association,
	Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Hands High, Touch by Alyssa Milano and over 140 U.S. colleges and universities. 


	 


	We operate in fashion markets that are
	intensely competitive. Our ability to continuously evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes, across multiple
	market segments, distribution channels and geographic areas is critical to our success. Although our portfolio of brands is aimed
	at diversifying our risks in this regard, misjudging shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on our business.
	Our success in the future will depend on our ability to design products that are accepted in the marketplace, source the manufacture
	of our products on a competitive basis, and continue to diversify our product portfolio and the markets we serve.



	 




	Segments



	 


	We report based on two reportable segments:
	wholesale operations and retail operations.


	 


	The wholesale operations segment includes
	sales of products under brands licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own brands and private
	label brands. Wholesale sales and revenues from license agreements related to the Donna Karan International (“DKI”)
	business are included in the wholesale operations segment.


	 


	The retail operations segment consists
	primarily of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY retail stores, substantially all of which are operated as outlet stores. As
	of April 30, 2017, we operated 174 Wilsons Leather stores, 155 G.H. Bass stores, 49 DKNY stores, 4 Calvin Klein Performance stores
	and 4 Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores. We also operate online stores for Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY.

	Recent Acquisitions



	 


	We have expanded our portfolio of proprietary
	and licensed brands through acquisitions and by entering into license agreements for new brands or for additional products under
	previously licensed brands. Acquisitions are part of our strategy to expand our product offerings and increase the portfolio of
	proprietary and licensed brands that we offer through different tiers of retail distribution.


	 


	In December 2016, we acquired all of the
	outstanding capital stock of Donna Karan International Inc. (“DKI”) from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. (“LVMH”)
	for a total purchase price of approximately $669.8 million. We believe that Donna Karan owns some of the world’s most iconic
	and recognizable power brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan and DKNY Jeans. The acquisition of Donna Karan fits squarely into our
	strategy to diversify and expand our business and to increase our ownership of brands. We intend to focus on the expansion of the
	DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY Jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that we can also capitalize
	on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. We believe
	that our strong track record of driving organic growth, identifying and integrating acquisitions and developing talent throughout
	the organization makes the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands especially appealing.


	 



	Licensed Products



	 


	The sale of licensed products is a key
	element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for more than 20 years.


	 


	In July 2016, we signed a three-year extension
	through March 2020 of our license agreement with the National Football League. This agreement includes men’s and women’s
	outerwear, Starter men’s and women’s outerwear, men’s and women’s lifestyle apparel, Hands High men’s
	and women’s lifestyle apparel and Touch by Alyssa Milano women’s lifestyle apparel.


	 


	In February 2016, we expanded our relationship
	with Tommy Hilfiger through a new license agreement for Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada. This license
	for women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, performance and denim is in addition to our existing Tommy Hilfiger licenses
	for men’s and women’s outerwear and luggage. The new Tommy Hilfiger agreement has an initial term of five years and
	a renewal term of four years. Macy’s will continue to be the principal retailer of Tommy Hilfiger in the United States and
	women’s sportswear will continue to be a Macy’s exclusive offering. We believe Tommy Hilfiger is a classic American
	lifestyle brand. We intend to leverage our market expertise to help build sales of Tommy Hilfiger women’s apparel. .


	 


	In October 2015, we announced the launch
	of Hands High, a new licensed sports apparel line inspired by Tonight Show host, Jimmy Fallon. Hands High products feature professional
	team logos from the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. Hands High product was launched in October 2015 at retailers throughout the country,
	as well as at official team and stadium shops and official league websites. We started to ship Hands High products to over 40 universities
	in July 2016.


	 


	We believe that consumers prefer to buy
	brands they know. We have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different
	tiers of retail distribution, for a wide array of products at a variety of price points. We believe that brand owners will look
	to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will seek licensees with a successful track record
	of expanding brands into new categories. It is our objective to continue to expand our product offerings and we are continually
	discussing new licensing opportunities with brand owners



	 




	Licensing



	 


	As we have increased our portfolio of proprietary
	brands, we have licensed these brands in categories outside our core competencies. We began licensing Andrew Marc, Vilebrequin
	and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in 2008, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our licensing program is
	expected to significantly increase as a result of owning the Donna Karan and DKNY brands.


	 


	The DKNY brand is currently licensed for
	a broad array of products including fragrance, watches, hosiery, intimates, eyewear, children’s clothing, home furnishings
	and menswear. We intend to focus on the expansion of licensing opportunities for the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY
	Jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential
	in a number of categories.


	 


	G.H. Bass is licensed for the wholesale
	distribution of men’s and women’s footwear, men’s sportswear, men’s and boy’s tailored clothing,
	men’s socks, men’s accessories and women’s hosiery.


	 


	Vilebrequin has entered into licenses for
	footwear, watches and sunglasses. Distribution of both watches and glasses started in April 2017.

	Retail Operations



	 


	We experienced substantial losses in our retail operations segment
	in fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are focusing on turning around our retail business by terminating or renegotiating
	long-term leases as they come up for renewal, implementing cost-cutting initiatives, revising our merchandising strategy and repurposing
	certain Wilsons and Bass stores for the Karl Lagerfeld or DKNY brands.


	 


	Sales of apparel over the Internet continue
	to increase. Our e-commerce business consists of our own web platforms under www.dkny.com, www.wilsonsleather.com, www.ghbass.com,
	www.vilebrequin.com and www.andrewmarc.com. We also sell our product on Karl Lagerfeld’s website, www.karllagerfeldparis.com.
	We sell our licensed product over the web through our retail partners, including Macys.com, Nordstrom.com and others, each of whom
	have significant online businesses. We have also increased sales to pure play online retail partners such as Amazon, Fanatics and
	others. We continue to develop additional marketing initiatives over the Internet, our web sites and social media to increase our
	e-commerce presence.


	 



	Trends



	 


	Significant trends that affect the apparel
	industry include retail chains closing unprofitable stores, an increased focus by retail chains on expanding their e-commerce,
	the continued consolidation of retail chains and the desire on the part of retailers to consolidate vendors supplying them.


	 


	Retailers are seeking to expand the differentiation
	of their offerings by devoting more resources to the development of exclusive products, whether by focusing on their own private
	label products or on products produced exclusively for a retailer by a national brand manufacturer. Retailers are placing more
	emphasis on building strong images for their private label and exclusive merchandise. Exclusive brands are only made available
	to a specific retailer, and thus customers loyal to their brands can only find them in the stores of that retailer.


	 


	A number of retailers are experiencing
	financial difficulties, which in some cases has resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and/or store closings. The financial difficulties
	of a retail customer of ours could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating
	to receivables of a retail customer experiencing financial difficulty that could result in higher reserves for doubtful accounts
	or increased write-offs of accounts receivable. We attempt to mitigate credit risk from our customers by closely monitoring accounts
	receivable balances and shipping levels, as well as the ongoing financial performance and credit standing of customers.


	 


	Sales of apparel over the Internet continue
	to increase. We are addressing the increase in online shopping by developing additional marketing initiatives over the Internet,
	our web sites and social media.


	 


	We have attempted to respond to trends
	in our industry by continuing to focus on selling products with recognized brand equity, by attention to design, quality and value
	and by improving our sourcing capabilities. We have also responded with the strategic acquisitions made by us and new license agreements
	entered into by us that added to our portfolio of licensed and proprietary brands and helped diversify our business by adding new
	product lines, expanding distribution channels and developing the retail component of our business. We believe that our broad distribution
	capabilities help us to respond to the various shifts by consumers between distribution channels and that our operational capabilities
	will enable us to continue to be a vendor of choice for our retail partners.


	 



	Results of Operations



	 




	Three months ended April 30, 2017
	compared to three months ended April 30, 2016




	 


	Net sales for the three months ended April
	30, 2017 increased to $529.0 million from $457.4 million in the same period last year. Net sales of our segments are reported before
	intercompany eliminations. Net sales of our wholesale operations segment increased to $453.0 million from $382.4 million in the
	comparable period last year, primarily as a result of an increase of $39.8 million in net sales of Tommy Hilfiger licensed products,
	driven by our new denim, sportswear, women’s performance wear and women’s suits licensed products and net sales of
	$39.6 million from our new DKNY and Donna Karan product lines. Net sales of our retail operations segment increased to $99.2 million
	for the three months ended April 30, 2017 from $95.0 million in the same period last year. The increase in net sales was the result
	of $15.3 million in net sales from our DKNY retail stores, acquired in December 2016, offset, in part, by a decrease in net sales
	of $5.3 million from each of our Wilsons and G.H. Bass store chains. Wilsons’ same store sales decreased by 11.3% compared
	to the same period in the prior year and G.H. Bass same store sales decreased by 9.2% compared to the same period in the prior
	year. These decreases are mainly the result of greater promotional activity in the current period compared to the same period last
	year.


	 


	Gross profit increased to $201.9 million,
	or 38.2% of net sales, for the three months ended April 30, 2017, from $165.7 million, or 36.2% of net sales, in the same period
	last year. The gross profit percentage in our wholesale operations segment was 34.1% in the three months ended April 30, 2017 compared
	to 32.5% in the same period last year. The increase in gross profit percentage was driven, in part, by DKNY and Donna Karan licensing
	income for which there is no associated cost of goods sold. In addition, we had improved gross profit margins due to a favorable
	product

	mix in our Calvin Klein dresses and women’s
	sportswear lines of product. The gross profit percentage in our retail operations segment was 47.6% for the three months ended
	April 30, 2017 compared to 43.4% for the same period last year. This increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to our
	DKNY retail stores, acquired in December 2016, which had a higher gross profit percentage than our other retail stores.


	 


	Selling, general and administrative expenses
	increased to $197.4 million in the three months ended April 30, 2017 from $153.1 million in the same period last year. Our Donna
	Karan business, which was acquired in December 2016, represented $40.9 million of this increase. The remainder of the increase
	is primarily due to increased facility costs ($5.3 million) and advertising expenses ($3.3 million). Facility costs increased as
	a result of increased shipping, storage and processing costs incurred at our third party warehouses, as well as higher rent expense.
	Advertising expense increased as a result of an increase in cooperative advertising and additional promotional expenses related
	to the launch of new product lines for Tommy Hilfiger, as well as an increase in expenses related to additional marketing initiatives
	over the Internet. These increases were offset, in part, by reduced bonus expense compared to last year as a result of our reduced
	profitability ($2.7 million).


	 


	Depreciation and amortization increased
	to $9.8 million in the three months ended April 30, 2017 from $7.2 million in the same period last year. These expenses increased
	as a result of additional depreciation and amortization expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of DKI.


	 


	Interest and financing charges, net, for
	the three months ended April 30, 2017 were $9.9 million compared to $1.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in
	interest and financing charges is a result of the additional interest incurred with respect the bank loans and the note issued
	to the seller in connection with the acquisition of DKI, as well as the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs.


	 


	Income tax benefit for the three months
	ended April 30, 2017 was $6.1 million as a result of the net loss incurred in the quarter compared to a $1.6 million tax expense
	for the same period last year when we recognized net income.


	Our effective tax rate remained the same for both periods at
	37.0%.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 



	Term Loan




	 



	On December 1, 2016, we entered into a
	credit agreement with the lenders party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative and collateral agent (the “Term
	Loan Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan Credit Agreement provided for term loans in the aggregate amount of $350.0 million
	(the “Term Loans”) that we used to fund a portion of the purchase price with respect to the acquisition of DKI. The
	Term Loans were subject to amortization payments of 0.625% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans per quarter,
	with the balance due at maturity. On December 1, 2016, we refinanced $50 million in principal amount of the Term Loans, reducing
	the principal balance of the Term Loans to $300 million. This prepayment relieved us of our obligation to make quarterly amortization
	payments for the remainder of the term.



	 



	The Term Loans will mature in December
	2022. Interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans accrues at a rate equal to LIBOR, subject to 1% floor, plus
	an applicable margin of 5.25% or an alternate base rate (defined as the greatest of  (i) the “prime rate” as
	published by the Wall Street Journal from time to time, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (iii) the LIBOR rate for a borrowing
	with an interest period of one month) plus 4.25%, per annum, payable in cash. As of April 30, 2017, interest under the Term Loan
	Agreement was being paid at an average rate of 6.3% per annum.


	 


	The Term Loans are secured (i) on a first-priority
	basis by a lien on our real estate assets, equipment and fixtures, equity interests and intellectual property and certain related
	rights owned us and by certain of our subsidiaries and (ii) by a second-priority security interest in other of our assets and certain
	of our subsidiaries, which secure on a first-priority basis our asset-based loan facility described below under the caption “Amended
	and Restated Credit Agreement”.


	 


	The Term Loans are required to be prepaid
	with the proceeds of certain asset sales if such proceeds are not applied as required by the Term Loan Credit Agreement within
	certain specified deadlines The Term Loans are also required to be prepaid in an amount equal to 75% of our Excess Cash Flow (as
	defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) with respect to each fiscal year ending on or after January 31, 2018. The percentage
	of Excess Cash Flow that must be so applied is reduced to 50% if our senior secured leverage ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00, to
	25% if our senior secured leverage ratio is less than 2.75 to 1.00 and to 0% if our senior secured leverage ratio is less than
	2.25 to 1.00


	 


	The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains
	covenants that restrict our ability to among other things, incur additional debt, sell or dispose certain assets, make certain
	investments, incur liens and enter into acquisitions. This agreement also includes a mandatory prepayment provision from excess
	cash flow as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. A first lien leverage covenant requires us to maintain a level of debt
	to EBITDA at a ratio as defined over the term of the Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of April 30, 2017, we were in compliance with
	this covenant.



	 




	Amended and Restated Credit Agreement



	 


	On December 1, 2016, we entered into an
	amended and restated credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative
	Agent. The ABL Credit Agreement is a five year senior secured revolving credit facility providing for borrowings in the aggregate
	principal amount of up to $650 million. The ABL Credit Agreement replaced our prior credit agreement that provided for borrowings
	of up to $450 million and was due to expire in August 2017.

	Table of Contents



	 


	 






	 


	Amounts available under the ABL Credit
	Agreement are subject to borrowing base formulas and over advances as specified in the ABL Credit Agreement. Borrowings bear interest,
	at the Borrowers’ option, at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% to 1.75% or an alternate base rate (defined as the greatest of 
	(i) the “prime rate” of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. from time to time, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (iii)
	the LIBOR rate for a borrowing with an interest period of one month) plus a margin of 0.25% to 0.75%, with the applicable margin
	determined based on Borrowers’ availability under the ABL Credit Agreement. As of April 30, 2017, interest under the ABL
	Credit Agreement was being paid at the average rate of 2.6% per annum. The ABL Credit Agreement is secured by specified assets
	of us and certain of our subsidiaries.


	 


	In addition to paying interest on any outstanding
	borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the ABL Credit Agreement
	with respect to the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee accrues at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum on the average daily
	amount of the available commitment.


	 


	The ABL Credit Agreement contains a number
	of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens;
	sell or dispose of assets; merge with other companies; liquidate or dissolve G-III; acquire other companies; make loans, advances,
	or guarantees; and make certain investments. In certain circumstances, the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum
	fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, that may not exceed 1.00 to 1.00 for each period of twelve consecutive fiscal months of
	holdings. As of April 30, 2017, we were in compliance with these covenants.



	 




	LVMH Note




	 



	On December 1, 2016, as a portion of the consideration
	for the acquisition of DKI, we issued to LVMH a junior lien secured promissory note in the principal amount of  $125.0 million
	(the “LVMH Note”) that bears interest at the rate of 2% per year. $75.0 million of the principal amount of the LVMH
	Note is due and payable on June 1, 2023 and $50.0 million of such principal amount is due and payable on December 1, 2023.


	 


	In connection with the issuance of the
	LVMH Note, LVMH entered into (i) a subordination agreement with Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent for the lender parties
	to the Term Loans and collateral agent for the senior secured parties thereunder and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative
	agent for the lenders and other senior secured parties under the ABL Credit Agreement, providing that our obligations under the
	LVMH Note are subordinate and junior to our obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement and the Term Loans, and (ii) a pledge and
	security agreement with us and our subsidiary, G-III Leather Fashions, Inc., pursuant to which G-III Leather granted to LVMH a
	security interest in specified collateral to secure our payment and performance of our obligations under the LVMH Note that is
	subordinate and junior to the security interest granted by us with respect to our obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement and
	Term Loans.


	 


	ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements
	requires the note to be recorded at Fair Value. As a result, we recorded a debt discount in the amount of $40.0 million. This
	discount is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the LVMH Note.


	 



	Outstanding Borrowings




	 



	Our primary operating cash requirements
	are to fund our seasonal buildup in inventories and accounts receivable, primarily during the second and third fiscal quarters
	each year. Due to the seasonality of our business, we generally reach our peak borrowings under our asset-based credit facility
	during our third fiscal quarter. The primary sources to meet our operating cash requirements have been borrowings under our credit
	facility, cash generated from operations and the sale of our common stock.


	 


	We incurred significant additional debt
	in connection with our acquisition of DKI. At April 30, 2017, we had $120.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the ABL
	Credit Agreement and $300 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loans. At April 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding
	under the prior credit agreement.. In addition to the amounts outstanding under these two loan agreements, at April 30, 2017,
	we had $125.0 million of principal amount outstanding under the LVMH Note. Our contingent liability under open letters of credit
	was approximately $13.1 million at April 30, 2017 compared to $17.9 million at April 30, 2016


	 


	We had cash and cash equivalents of $67.1
	million on April 30, 2017 and $95.4 million on April 30, 2016.


	 



	Share Repurchase Program



	 


	Our Board of Directors has authorized a
	share repurchase program of 5,000,000 shares. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased, if any, will depend on a number
	of factors, including market conditions and prevailing stock prices, and are subject to compliance with certain covenants contained
	in our loan agreement. Share repurchases may take place on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means,
	and would be made in accordance with applicable securities laws. No shares were purchased under the program during the three months
	ended April 30, 2017. As of April 30, 2017, we had approximately 48.7 million shares of common stock outstanding.


	 



	Cash from Operating Activities



	 


	We used $33.2 million of cash in operating
	activities during the three months ended April 30, 2017, primarily as a result of a decrease of $69.6 million in accounts payable
	and accrued expenses and our net loss of $10.4 million, offset, by a decrease in inventory of $37.4 million and a decrease in accounts
	receivable of $7.7 million.

	Table of Contents



	 


	 






	 


	The changes in these operating cash flow
	items are generally consistent with our seasonal pattern. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily attributable
	to vendor payments related to inventory purchases and the payment of accrued year-end bonuses in our first fiscal quarter. Our
	inventory decreased because we experience lower sales levels in our first and second fiscal quarters than in our third and fourth
	fiscal quarters.


	  



	Cash from Investing Activities



	 


	We used $5.7 million of cash in investing
	activities in the three months ended April 30, 2017. The cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures related
	to additional fixturing costs at department stores, as well as, to improving, remodeling and relocating G.H. Bass and Wilsons stores.


	 



	Cash from Financing Activities



	 


	Net proceeds of $29.0 million was provided
	by financing activities in the three months ended April 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the net proceeds of  $28.9 million
	in borrowings under our revolving credit line.


	 



	Financing Needs



	 


	We believe that our cash on hand and cash
	generated from operations for the year as a whole, together with funds available under the ABL Credit Agreement, are sufficient
	to meet our expected operating and capital expenditure requirements. We may seek to acquire other businesses in order to expand
	our product offerings. We may need additional financing in order to complete one or more acquisitions. We cannot be certain that
	we will be able to obtain additional financing, if required, on acceptable terms or at all.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	Our discussion of results of operations
	and financial condition relies on our consolidated financial statements that are prepared based on certain critical accounting
	policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. We believe
	that investors need to be aware of these policies and how they impact our financial statements as a whole, as well as our related
	discussion and analysis presented herein. While we believe that these accounting policies are based on sound measurement criteria,
	actual future events can, and often do, result in outcomes that can be materially different from these estimates or forecasts.


	 


	The accounting policies and related estimates
	described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2017 are those that depend most heavily on these judgments
	and estimates. As of April 30, 2017, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies.

	Controls
	and Procedures.






	 


	As of the end of the period covered by
	this report, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the
	effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
	Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information

G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Fiscal 2017 Results


--Provides Fiscal 2018 Guidance--

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (NasdaqGS:GIII) today announced operating

      results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2017 year and provided

      financial guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal 2018 year.

    


      Net sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 were up 1.8% to

      $2.39 billion from $2.34 billion in the prior year. Growth over the

      prior year was primarily the result of increases in the Company's

      wholesale non-outerwear business and net sales from the Donna Karan

      International ("DKI") business in the last two months of the fiscal year

      and was offset, in part, by softer demand for outerwear and a decline in

      net sales in the Company's retail businesses.

    


      The Company reported GAAP net income for the fiscal year ended January

      31, 2017 of $51.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to

      $114.3 million, or $2.46 per diluted share, in the prior year.

    


      On an adjusted basis, for fiscal 2017, excluding (i) professional fees

      of $7.8 million related to the acquisition of DKI, (ii) non-cash imputed

      interest expense of $1.0 million related to the note issued to seller as

      part of the consideration for the acquisition of DKI, (iii) severance of

      $3.9 million (all related to the acquisition of DKI) and (iv) asset

      impairments of $10.5 million (related to the retail operations segment),

      equal to $0.32 per diluted share, and, for fiscal 2016, excluding items

      that resulted in other income of $1.1 million, equal to $0.02 per

      diluted share, non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the full fiscal

      2017 year decreased to $1.42 from $2.44 in the prior fiscal year.

    


      Included in both GAAP and non-GAAP results for fiscal 2017 are operating

      losses of $9.2 million and additional interest expense of $7.5 million

      related to the operation and ownership of DKI, equal to an aggregate of

      $0.24 per diluted share. The acquisition of DKI was completed on

      December 1, 2016.

    


      For the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2017, net sales increased by

      14.4% to $603 million from $527 million in the fourth quarter last year.

      The year-over-year increase in net sales in the fourth quarter reflects

      strength in the Company's non-outerwear wholesale business, including

      new product launches, as well as the inclusion of approximately $29.0

      million of net sales from the DKI business in the last two months of the

      quarter. These increases were partially offset by declines in net sales

      of the Company's retail businesses.

    


      The Company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $20.1 million, or

      $0.42 per share, compared to net income of $8.0 million, or $0.16 per

      diluted share, in the fourth quarter last year.

    


      On an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, excluding

      (i) professional fees of $5.2 million, (ii) non-cash imputed interest

      expense of $1.0 million, (iii) severance of $3.9 million (all related to

      the acquisition of DKI) and (iv) asset impairments of $10.5 million

      (related to the retail operations segment) equal to $0.26 per share,

      non-GAAP net loss was $0.16 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal

      2017 compared to non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.17 in the

      fourth quarter last year.

    


      Included in both GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of

      fiscal 2017 are losses of $9.2 million and additional interest expense

      of $7.5 million related to the operation and ownership of DKI, equal to

      an aggregate of $0.21 per share.

    

Morris Goldfarb, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of G-III Apparel

      Group, Ltd., commented, "Fiscal 2017 was another important year for our

      Company. We completed the acquisition of Donna Karan which made us the

      owner of two of the world's most iconic and recognizable power brands in

      Donna Karan and DKNY. This acquisition further bolsters our value

      proposition and strengthens our position as an all-season diversified

      apparel company with a broad portfolio of brands offered in multiple

      channels of retail distribution. Our non-outerwear wholesale business

      performed well in the face of significant headwinds as the traditional

      retail environment has become increasingly disrupted as a result of

      evolving consumer buying behavior and continued penetration of

      e-commerce. We expect to initiate a number of new product launches in

      the coming year as we seek to offer superior value in the marketplace."

    

Mr. Goldfarb continued, "While our near-term financial outlook reflects

      the dilutive impact of our recent acquisition of Donna Karan, we believe

      the mid-year re-launch of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands will have a

      positive impact in the second half of the year. We are confident that we

      have one of the most desirable portfolios of brands in the industry and

      that DKNY and Donna Karan will quickly take their place alongside Calvin

      Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Karl Lagerfeld as the cornerstone brands for

      the growth of our business."

    

Outlook


G-III Apparel Group today issued guidance for the fiscal year ending

      January 31, 2018. For fiscal 2018, the Company is forecasting net sales

      of approximately $2.73 billion and net income between $40 million and

      $45 million, or between $0.80 and $0.90 per diluted share.

    


      The Company is forecasting DKI transitional expenses of $9 million and

      non-cash imputed interest expense of $6 million in its forecasted

      results. On an adjusted basis, excluding transitional expenses and

      imputed interest expense, the Company is anticipating non-GAAP net

      income between approximately $49 million and $54 million, or between

      $0.99 and $1.09 per diluted share.

    


      The forecasted GAAP and non-GAAP results reflect expected operational

      losses of $31 million and additional interest expense of $36 million, or

      an aggregate of $0.85 per diluted share, associated with the Donna Karan

      business. The forecast also includes the full year impact of the

      issuance of approximately 2.6 million shares of new G-III common stock

      to the seller of DKI.

    


      The Company is projecting full-year adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018

      between $162 million and $171 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of

      $148.1 million in fiscal 2017. This adjusted EBITDA guidance includes a

      full-year loss of approximately $20 million associated with the Donna

      Karan business.

    


      For the first fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2017, the Company is

      forecasting net sales of approximately $500 million and a net loss

      between $20 million and $25 million, or between $0.41 and $0.51 per

      share. This forecast compares to net sales of $457 million and net

      income of $2.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, reported in the

      first quarter of fiscal 2017.

    


      The first quarter forecast assumes DKI transitional expenses of $3.0

      million and non-cash imputed interest expense of $1.4 million. On an

      adjusted basis, excluding transitional and imputed interest expense, the

      Company is forecasting a non-GAAP net loss between $0.35 and $0.45 per

      share.

    


      The forecasted GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal

      2018 reflect expected operational losses of $26 million and additional

      interest expense of $9 million, or an aggregate of $0.45 per share,

      associated with the Donna Karan business. The forecast also includes the

      full impact of the issuance of approximately 2.6 million shares of new

      G-III common stock to the seller of DKI.

    


      The Company anticipates that it will incur losses from the Donna Karan

      operations during the first half of fiscal 2018 that will be partially

      offset by growth in operating profitability beginning in the third

      quarter as the Company begins shipments and re-launches DKNY and Donna

      Karan products. The Company anticipates the impact of operational losses

      and additional interest in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 will

      approximate the first quarter impact.

    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures



      Reconciliations of GAAP net income per share to Non-GAAP net income per

      share and of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA are presented in tables

      accompanying the condensed financial statements included in this release

      and provide useful information to evaluate the Company's operational

      performance. Non-GAAP net income per share and adjusted EBITDA should be

      evaluated in light of the Company's financial statements prepared in

      accordance with GAAP.

      Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share is a "non-GAAP financial

      measure" that excludes (i) professional fees, non-cash imputed interest

      expense and severance expense in connection with the acquisition of DKI

      in fiscal 2017, as well as asset impairments related to the retail

      operations segment, and (ii) other income in fiscal 2016 that consisted

      of the reduction of the estimated contingent consideration payable in

      connection with the acquisition of Vilebrequin. Income tax impacts of

      non-GAAP adjustments are calculated using the effective tax rates for

      the respective period. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial

      measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our

      performance by excluding acquisition-related expenses and other income

      that is not indicative of our core business operating results.

      Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to assess our

      performance on a comparative basis and believes that it is also useful

      to investors to enable them to assess our performance on a comparative

      basis across historical periods and facilitate comparisons of our

      operating results to those of our competitors. The presentation of this

      financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or

      as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared

      and presented in accordance with GAAP.

      Adjusted EBITDA is a "non-GAAP financial measure" which represents

      earnings before depreciation and amortization, interest and financing

      charges, net, and income tax expense and excludes (i) professional fees

      and severance expense in connection with the acquisition of DKI in

      fiscal 2017, as well as asset impairments related to the retail

      operations segment, and (ii) other income in fiscal 2016 that consisted

      of the reduction of the estimated contingent consideration payable in

      connection with the acquisition of Vilebrequin. Adjusted EBITDA is being

      presented as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that

      it is a common measure of operating performance in the apparel industry.

      Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income

      as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or as an

      alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the

      Company's liquidity, as determined in accordance with generally accepted

      accounting principles.

      Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share is a "non-GAAP financial

      measure" that excludes acquisition related professional fees, non-cash

      imputed interest expense and transitional expenses, which are comprised

      primarily of severance expenses, in connection with the acquisition of

      DKI, as well as asset impairments related to the retail operations

      segment in fiscal 2017. Income tax impacts of non-GAAP adjustments are

      calculated using the effective tax rates for the respective period.

      Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides

      meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by

      excluding acquisition-related expenses and other income that is not

      indicative of our core business operating results. Management uses this

      non-GAAP financial measure to assess our performance on a comparative

      basis and believes that it is also useful to investors to enable them to

      assess our performance on a comparative basis across historical periods

      and facilitate comparisons of our operating results to those of our

      competitors. The presentation of this financial information is not

      intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or

      superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in

Why G-III Apparel Group Ltd. Stock Soared Today
The diversified apparel group beat estimates and raised its guidance.











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Jun 6, 2017 at 12:22PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of G-III Apparel Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:GIII) jumped Tuesday after the diversified clothing brand beat estimates in its first-quarter earnings report and raised its guidance.
As of 11:10 a.m. EDT, the stock was up 21.5%.

Image source: G-III.

So what
The company, which owns brands such as Donna Karan and Vilebrequin and licenses several others, said that revenue surged 16% in the quarter to $529 million. That easily beat expectations at $499.6 million.
On the bottom line, G-III posted an adjusted loss of -$0.18 a share, down from a profit of $0.06 a share in the period a year ago. However, without the effect of the recent acquisition of Donna Karan International, G-III would have had an $0.11 per share profit in the period.
Even without the adjustment, the loss was still better than expected, as analysts predicted a shortfall of -$0.37 a share.
Commenting on the quarter, CEO Morris Goldfarb said, "Our wholesale business demonstrates the power of our brand portfolio to transcend a difficult market environment." He also said the company was reducing operating costs and closing and repurposing stores, in order to reduce loses in the company's retail operations.





Now what
G-III's guidance was also better than expected as it now sees revenue of $2.76 billion, up from $2.73 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.30, better than the previous range of $0.99 to $1.09.
Wall Street had expected revenue of $2.72 billion and EPS of just $1.01.
Clearly, the improved guidance is a positive for shareholders, but they should keep an eye on the retail segment as apparel retailers have been getting crushed by e-commerce and fast fashion competitors. G-III has a solid stable of brands and should be able to succeed if it manages its costs effectively. However, with the shifting retail consumption patterns, the industry continues to be a risky one.

Giii's HistoryOfficer BioCorporate Responsibility  


ABOUT GIII
G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.  (“G-III") traces its roots back to 1956 when Aron Goldfarb, a Holocaust survivor, immigrated to the United States and established his own outerwear company located in the heart of New York City’s Garment District.  As early as 1972, G-III began to diversify its offerings, when Morris Goldfarb, its current Chief Executive Officer and son of its founder, joined G-III.  Morris introduced an entrepreneurial spirit to G-III which has propelled the company for more than forty years.  Almost immediately, G-III expanded its sourcing, becoming one of the first companies to import outerwear from South Korea.  This established a strong connection between G-III and the Pacific Rim manufacturing zone, which remains intact today. In 1981, G-III began expanding by launching its first division, Siena Leather Limited, an aspirational luxury leather sportswear company that catered to high-end department stores.  In 1989, G-III became publicly traded and began intensifying its expansion efforts.
The early 1990’s was a period of rapid growth for G-III as it worked to broaden its outerwear offerings.  Beginning  with the Colebrook & Co. label,  G-III launched a textile outerwear collection.  In addition, G-III began manufacturing men’s outerwear, also under the Colebrook & Co. label.  In order to further G-III’s reach, it started producing licensed merchandise for the National Football League through a partnership with two-time Super Bowl champion linebacker, Carl Banks.  When G-III recognized the consumer’s preference for  name brands, the Company began partnering with nationally recognized brands such as Kenneth Cole, Jones New York, Nine West and  Cole Haan to produce branded outerwear under license agreements.  By partnering with these national brands, G-III altered the landscape of how outerwear was marketed and sold in department stores in  the United States.
G-III continued to license nationally recognized brands throughout the 1990’s in order to fill out a matrix of both men’s and women’s products.  Seeking to expand on the success of its partnership with the National Football League, the Company established agreements with other sports organizations such as the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League and over 100 U.S. colleges and universities.
In July 2005, G-III acquired two very important businesses on the same day.  By purchasing Marvin Richards and Winlit, G-III consolidated with two of its largest competitors and set the stage for a transformation of G-III, which included a significant expansion of management, merchandising, manufacturing and design expertise.  An immediate benefit of the Marvin Richards acquisition was the addition of licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the Calvin Klein brand name.  The purchase of Winlit granted G-III licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the Guess? brand name.  These extra licenses propelled G-III to the forefront of the outerwear business.  The acquisition of Marvin Richards had other benefits as well, as G-III expanded its Calvin Klein offerings to include women’s suits, dresses, performance wear, sportswear, handbags, luggage and cold weather accessories.  G-III has become the second largest licensee for the Calvin Klein brand.
In 2007, G-III added to its dress portfolio with the acquisitions of Jessica Howard and Eliza J.  At the same time, G-III expanded its license agreement with Ellen Tracy to include the production of women’s suits and dresses.  These assets allowed G-III to establish itself as a powerhouse in the dress market.  By 2011, G-III was manufacturing and shipping dresses under the following brand names…Andrew Marc, Calvin Klein, Eliza J, Ellen Tracy, Guess?, Jessica Howard, Jessica Simpson, Kensie, Marc New York and Vince Camuto.  G-III is now one of the most dominant dress manufacturers in the United States.
In February 2008, G-III purchased Andrew Marc, a well-known brand.  Andrew Marc, established in 1982, was a nationally recognized aspirational luxury outerwear company.  G-III sought to develop Andrew Marc into a meaningful lifestyle brand and, as a result, G-III became a licensor for the first time.  Andrew Marc now has license agreements for a number of different product categories.  G-III has also used its in house capabilities to expand Andrew Marc to additional categories such as dresses, women’s handbags and men’s denim and related sportswear. 
In 2008, entering the retail arena, G-III purchased the Wilsons Leather retail outlet chain, which now includes over 135 stores in over 30 states. The expertise of the Wilsons team has allowed G-III to expand retail with the opening of a limited number of Andrew Marc outlet stores and Calvin Klein Performance stores.
Continuing diversification efforts, G-III seeks to broaden the Company’s reach in crucial areas.  For example, building on the Company’s license to produce Calvin Klein sportswear, G-III entered into an agreement in 2011 to design and manufacture sportswear under the Kensie label, a feminine yet edgy women’s lifestyle brand.  G-III also has licenses with Kensie to produce other apparel and accessories.
In August 2012, G-III acquired Vilebrequin, a leading global provider of swimwear, accessories and resort wear. Vilebrequin sells its products through a large network of company owned and franchised specialty retail stores and shops, as well as through select wholesale distribution. G-III believes that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand and expects to add more company owned and franchised retail locations, increase wholesale distribution around the world and develop the business beyond its heritage in men’s swimwear, accessories and resort wear. This addition provides G-III with a premier brand selling status products worldwide. 
In November 2013, G-III purchased G.H. Bass, a timeless heritage footwear brand that was founded in 1876. G.H. Bass is known as the original creator of the penny loafer.
In June 2015, G-III entered into a joint venture agreement with Karl Lagerfeld Group through the acquisition of a 49% ownership interest in Karl Lagerfeld North America, an entity that holds brand rights to Karl Lagerfeld trademarks for all consumer products and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. G-III is also the first licensee of the joint venture and has been granted a license for women’s apparel, women’s handbags, women’s footwear and men’s outerwear. This joint venture gives G-III the opportunity to add in its portfolio an iconic and high-end brand with a worldwide reputation.
In February 2016, G-III acquired a 19% minority interest in Kingdom Holdings 1, the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. This investment is intended to expand the partnership between the Company and the Karl Lagerfeld brand and extend their business development opportunities on a global scale.
In July 2016, G-III entered into a stock purchase agreement with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. providing for our purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Donna Karan International Inc. The acquisition of Donna Karan fits squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business. We intend to focus on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that we can also capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. We believe that our strong track record of driving organic growth, identifying and integrating acquisitions and developing talent throughout the organization makes the potential of the Donna Karan brand especially appealing
In December 2016, G-III acquired Donna Karan International, Inc., parent of the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. The acquisition of Donna Karan fits squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business. We intend to focus on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that we can also capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. We believe that our strong track record of driving organic growth, identifying and integrating acquisitions and developing talent throughout the organization makes the potential of the Donna Karan brand especially appealing.
An entrepreneurial culture flows throughout the organization at G-III. It has been essential in driving its diversification efforts and has enabled it to change its business model from being solely an outerwear producer to becoming a diversified apparel company. Today, G-III is proud to have a comprehensive portfolio of over 30 licensed and proprietary brands, including Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Guess?, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Dockers, Jessica Simpson, Vince Camuto, Ellen Tracy, Kensie, Ivanka Trump, and G.H. Bass, among others. G-III also has licenses with the four major professional sports leagues, as well as over 100 U.S. colleges and universities. In addition, G-III currently designs, manufactures and markets an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, beachwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear, as well as luggage and women’s handbags, small leather goods and various accessories.
Still located in the center of New York City’s Garment District, G-III’s goals for the future are consistent with its storied past…produce great products that enable it to reach a broad spectrum of consumers; partner with nationally recognized brands to appeal to a brand conscious apparel market; and, perhaps most importantly, engage the entrepreneurial spirit that got it here by constantly seeking attractive new licenses and acquisitions to expand its reach and abilities.
