Visit the commencement page for dates, locations, directions and information on ceremonies for all Yeshiva University schools and affiliates.
President Richard M. Joel will also confer an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters upon Dr. Alan Willner and Eleazer Hirmes. Willner, a 1982 graduate of Yeshiva College, is a highly decorated physicist, who has published more than 950 papers on his research in optical technologies. Currently a chaired professor of engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California, he holds 24 patents. His research has been supported by institutions such as Cisco, the Department of Defense, Google, Hewlett Packard, Intel, the National Science Foundation and the National Security Agency.
Dr. Alan Willner
Hirmes’ family relationship with Yeshiva University dates back to the early years of the 20th century, when his father, Rabbi Abraham P. Hirmes, left the Slobatka Yeshiva in Lithuania to pursue his rabbinical ordination at YU-affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. Eleazer attended YU High School and graduated from Yeshiva College in 1944. He received an MBA from New York University and spent 60 years practicing as a CPA, becoming a noted philanthropist in the Five Towns of New York. Hirmes and his wife Greta have set up a scholarship fund in honor of his parents.
Eleazer Hirmes
Ethel Orlian, the associate dean of Stern College for Women, will be awarded the Presidential Medallion. Orlian has spent more than 50 years as a student, teacher and administrator at Yeshiva University. A graduate of YU High School and Stern College, she began her YU career as a researcher, but left to live in Israel before returning to Stern in 1979 as the assistant to Karen Bacon, dean of Stern College for Women. Known to generations of Stern College women, she has remained at the college since—serving as assistant dean and academic counselor and teaching chemistry prior to her appointment as associate dean.
Ethel Orlian
“Each of our honorees embodies a different piece of the principles of Yeshiva University, their commitment to the Jewish people, the State of Israel, their hometowns and to the University itself,” said President Joel. “We hope they inspire our graduates to leave our school for success now, but know they always have a home at YU.”
In all, more than 1,400 undergraduate students from Yeshiva College, Stern College for Women and Syms School of Business, as well as graduate students in the fields of law, medicine, social work, education, Jewish studies and psychology, will be awarded degrees from YU during its commencement season.

An Inside Look at Halachic Jurisprudence



New Journal from the Beth Din of America and RIETS Sheds Light on Practices of Rabbinical Courts
The Beth Din of America (BDA), in collaboration with the Rabbi Norman Lamm Yadin Yadin Kollel of YU-affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), recently published its first journal for spring 2012. The Journal of the Beth Din of America, sponsored by the Michael Scharf Publication Trust of RIETS/Yeshiva University Press, contains articles on Jewish jurisprudence and beth din practice, with a particular emphasis on the policies and practices of the BDA—North America’s most active rabbinical court.
Each issue will include actual din torah or decisions rendered by the BDA (appropriately anonymized and approved for publication by the involved parties), exposing readers to the practices of contemporary beth din and the intellectual foundations for its work. The journal will primarily feature articles by dayanim [judges] of the BDA.
Topics covered in the inaugural issue range from “The Prenuptial Agreement: Recent Developments” by Rabbi Mordechai Willig, Rabbi Dr. Sol Roth Professor of Talmud and Contemporary Halacha at RIETS and Segan Av Beit Din at BDA, to “Jewish Law, Civil Procedure: A Comparative Study” by Rabbi Yona Reiss, Max and Marion Grill Dean of RIETS and Chaver Beth Din at BDA.
“It is our hope that this journal and the study it enables will serve as a vehicle for the clarification and dissemination of the Torah’s laws relating to the beth din process,” said Rabbi Yaacov Feit’02YC, ’06R, ’06A, who along with Rabbi Shlomo Weissmann ’92YUHS, ’96YC, ’03R, serves as co-editor of the journal.
Since its inception nearly 50 years ago, BDA has been recognized as one of the nation’s pre-eminent rabbinic courts. It serves the Jewish community of North America as a forum for obtaining Jewish divorces, confirming personal status and adjudicating commercial disputes stemming from divorce, business and community issues.

Unshackled



YU Panel Explores Solutions to Modern-Day Agunah Crisis
Members of the Yeshiva University community flooded Weissberg Commons to hear a multifaceted discussion of the plight of the modern-day agunah, a woman whose husband cannot or refuses to give her a get [writ of Jewish divorce], on March 29.
"Fighting the Agunah Crisis" Panelists: Dr. David Pelcovitz, Rabbi Jeremy Stern, Tamar Epstein and Rabbi Hershel Schachter.
Titled “Fighting the Agunah Crisis,” the panel offered rabbinic, psychological and devastating personal insight into the complicated status of an agunah and the challenges she faces. That included testimony from Tamar Epstein ’04S, a nurse-practitioner and current agunah whose case has received a great deal of media attention due to the coordinated efforts of committed friends and the Organization for the Resolution of Agunot (ORA).
Before a crowd that overflowed into the hall, Epstein detailed her struggle to extract a get from her ex-husband and described the situation’s impact on her life, as well as her young daughter. “Divorce is always painful but the healing process can’t begin until the two parties have completely disentangled themselves from each other and can begin to move on with their lives, and that’s exactly what the agunah can’t do,” she said.
“That someone in our community is twisting halakha [Jewish law], not only selfishly, but also maliciously, must be intolerable to us,” said Ahuva Yagod, a sophomore at Stern College for Women and president of the Agunah Advocacy Club, one of the night’s sponsors. “We must be aware when someone is manipulating the divorce proceedings and we must stand united to eradicate this problem.”
The panel was co-sponsored by Stern’s Torah Activities Council as the final event in a week of programming for Domestic Violence and Abuse Awareness Week. In addition to Epstein, it featured Rabbi Hershel Schachter, rosh reshiva at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) and Nathan and Vivian Fink Distinguished Professorial Chair in Talmud; Dr. David Pelcovitz, Gwendolyn and Joseph Straus Chair in Psychology and Jewish Education at the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration; and Rabbi Jeremy Stern ’07YC, ’09A, ’10R, executive director of ORA.
While touching on aspects of Epstein’s individual case, each of the panelists emphasized that the issue of agunah was communal and underlined the need to support agunot by upholding a zero-tolerance policy for get refusal.
“When ORA takes on a case, we always try to solve it amicably at first, looking deep into its facts and following the paper trail, making sure we’re hearing as many perspectives as possible,” said Stern. “But once a marriage is deemed irreconcilable, an unconditional get must be furnished in a timely fashion. Withholding a get is not a means of negotiation—negotiations can’t be conducted when someone is holding a gun to your head or a get over it. ”
Epstein agreed. “My ex-husband did not become a get refuser overnight,” she said. “I believe a get refuser is formed in large part by messages conveyed to him, both implicitly and explicitly, by his community.” She added: “The agunah is amongst the most vulnerable people in our community. We, as a community, have a responsibility to protect her and ensure her release and we can achieve that goal if we ourselves, our institutions and our leadership accept a zero-tolerance policy on get refusal.”
Panelists also noted the importance of making the halachik prenuptial agreement a standard component of the marriage process for all Orthodox couples. This is the goal of an ORA initiative titled, “Friends Don’t Let Friends Get Married Without A Prenup.” Copies of the agreement, which contains a monetary incentive to give a get and preselects a beit din [Jewish court] to hear any divorce proceedings, were distributed at the event and slid under dorm room doors across both campuses.
YU alumni, Stern and Epstein, are raising awareness of the plight of agunot.
“If every YU student signed a prenup, we could eradicate this problem from our community,” said Stern. “Don’t sign it for yourselves. Sign it for someone who might not be here tonight and might not otherwise hear this message and might need to.”
Ilana Gadish, ’11S a current student enrolled in Stern’s Graduate Program for Talmudic Studies, actually signed the same copy of the agreement that was slipped under her dorm room door last year before her recent marriage. “The issue of agunot is one of the most important in the modern Orthodox community,” she said.
Gadish felt the night’s panel helped her understand the necessity of uncomfortable tactics, such as rallying and signing petitions, to pressure husbands into granting a get. “I used to be more hesitant about attending rallies, but after hearing Tamar speak in person, I would definitely go.”
Another young couple filled out the prenup on the spot.
“We were planning to do this before, but they had notaries here, so we thought, ‘Why not?’ ” said Sarah Marvin, a junior at Stern College majoring in English literature. “After seeing all the publicity about agunot, I’m just making sure it doesn’t happen to me.”
“I have fond memories of my years at Stern and a great appreciation for the education I’ve received here, but over the past years I’ve developed a deeper sense of pride in my status as a YU alumna,” said Epstein. “I’ve witnessed and personally benefited from the courage, innovation and sensitivity of the roshei yeshiva and administrative leadership of this institution in tackling the problem of the modern day agunah.”

Rabbi Shlomo Amar, the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, paid a visit to Yeshiva University-affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) on March 28. Upon arrival he was greeted by Rabbi Eliyahu Ben-Haim, Maxwell R. Maybaum Memorial Chair in Talmud and Sephardic Codes; Rabbi Dr. Herbert Dobrinsky, vice president for university affairs and Rabbi Moshe Tessone, director of YU’s Sephardic Community Program.
[flickrslideshow acct_name=”yeshivauniversity” id=”72157629325173748″]
The chief rabbi, also known as the Rishon LeZion, delivered a shiur [lecture] to hundreds of students in the Glueck Beit Midrash, after which he participated in a luncheon with various roshei yeshiva and members of the YU faculty and administration including Rabbi Yona Reiss, Max and Marion Grill Dean of RIETS; Chancellor Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm, Rosh HaYeshiva; Rabbi Zevulun Charlop, dean emeritus of RIETS; Rabbi Hershel Schachter, Nathan and Vivian Fink Distinguished Professorial Chair in Talmud; and Rabbi Mordechai Willig, Rabbi Dr. Sol Roth Chair in Talmud and Contemporary Halacha, among others. This was Rabbi Amar’s third visit to the YU campus in recent years.
“Hakham [rabbi] Amar’s visit to Yeshiva strengthens the relationship between our roshei yeshiva, the RIETS administration and the office of the chief rabbinate of the State of Israel,” said Tessone. “His visit is also significant to the Sephardic population on campus which benefitted from hearing his words and participating in the mitzvah of kabbalat pnei hakhamim [receiving great Torah luminaries].”

New Head of School at YUHSB



Rabbi Michael Taubes Named Head of School at Yeshiva University High School for Boys
Rabbi Michael Taubes, an educator with more than three decades of experience in Jewish education and administration, has been named rosh yeshiva / head of school at Yeshiva University High School for Boys (YUHSB) / Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy. The appointment is the culmination of an extensive international search that involved parents, faculty, board members and YU administrators.
Rabbi Michael Taubes will serve as head of school and rosh yeshiva at YU High School for Boys
“Our students and faculty are fortunate to be led by Rabbi Taubes who can bring them to levels of greatness in Torah studies, general studies and ethical and moral behavior,” said Miriam Goldberg, chair of Yeshiva University High Schools Board of Trustees.
Taubes, who has served as interim head of school since September, will continue to work closely with Dr. Seth Taylor, principal for general studies, to ensure that YUHSB is constantly growing to its next horizon and maximizing its relationship with its parent institution, Yeshiva University. With the vibrant beit midrash of a premier Torah institution, the state-of-the-art facilities of a national research university, and world-class roshei yeshiva and professors just steps away, YUHSB’s students and faculty will continue to benefit from their connection to YU.
“Rabbi Taubes brings to our school years of experience as an educator and a role model,” said YU Vice President and Chief of Staff Rabbi Josh Joseph, who directly oversees the high school. “Through his interim leadership role, we’ve noticed a shift in the school’s mood and atmosphere, one that is all for the better and we expect that he will continue to work with our first-class faculty and dedicated parent body to ensure that our students turn into mentschlich bnei torah and future scholars that can only be trained at a place like MTA.”
An alumnus of Yeshivat Har Etzion in Israel, Taubes attended Yeshiva College, where he was honored upon graduation in 1980 with an award for excellence in Talmud. He earned his semicha from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, where he studied in the shiur of Rav Joseph B. Soloveitchik, zt’l, and holds a master’s degree in Jewish Education from YU’s Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology. Taubes, his wife, Bassie and their children, reside in Teaneck, NJ, where he serves as the spiritual leader of Congregation Zichron Mordechai.

YU’s 87th Hanukkah Dinner and Convocation



Senator Gillibrand Keynotes Hanukkah Convocation; Philip Friedman, Ira Mitzner and Stephen Siegel Honored
U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand delivered the keynote address at Yeshiva University’s 87th Annual Hanukkah Convocation and Dinner on Sunday, December 11 at The Waldorf=Astoria in New York City. YU President Richard M. Joel bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Gillibrand, describing her as “a voice for vulnerable citizens” and her career as one in which “fervor for family fuels [her] political passions.” The New York senator is best known for her plans to help struggling working families, rebuilding the economy by creating jobs, championing higher education, strengthening America’s armed services and fighting against childhood obesity.
[flickrslideshow acct_name=”yeshivauniversity” id=”72157628389428169″]
“Whatever issue you bring, you bring from principle, not partisanship or ideology,” said President Joel. “You devote your professional career to opening the eyes of so many who don’t want to see.”
In her convocation address, a heartfelt message replete with both personal anecdotes and political aspirations, Gillibrand praised Yeshiva University for ingraining in all its students a defining mantra of giving and leadership, and inspiring students to reach out and make a difference in the lives of others all over the world.
“I am most grateful for the leadership taught here at Yeshiva University… a quality education built on a foundation of faith and values,” said Gillibrand. “When times are dark and unstable, this leadership is seen in its greatest light and we need to share these opportunities for vision and commitment.”
At the convocation, President Joel also conferred honorary degrees upon technology executive Philip Friedman, a member of YU’s Board of Trustees since 2009 and a former board member of YU’s SYMS School of Business; real estate developer Ira Mitzner, a trustee of YU since 2007 who established the David Mitzner Deanship of the CJF; and commercial real estate executive Stephen B. Siegel, a 25-year board member at YU’s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.
“These recipients of honorary degrees are a shining light on YU and the world, and their lights are life lessons to our students and to all of us,” said President Joel. “Tonight, we celebrate the successes of an amazing, noble enterprise, and resolve to keep it strong and sacred.
“Like the ancient Maccabees, and the YU Maccabeats, we reaffirm our commitment to life and values, to success and purpose, to faith and freedom, to teach and to touch, to rights and responsibilities,” he said. “Yeshiva teaches its students to dream and to achieve. The Jewish people, the United States, Israel, indeed the whole world, needs to reignite the passion of purpose, the belief in ideas, the access to achievement and the possibilities of tomorrow.”
During the dinner portion, President Joel also recognized eight Points of Lights—people who exemplify the mission of Yeshiva University—calling each one up to light a symbolic candle on the menorah. Read more about the Points of Light here.
