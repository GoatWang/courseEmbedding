Why Pride Matters at Shaw + Scott

Julian Scott  June 23,2017  
                                
                                











According to Webster’s Dictionary, pride can be defined as “the quality or state of being proud.”And proud is what we are at Shaw + Scott. We’re proud of our LGBTQ colleagues, friends and family. We’re proud that we celebrate diversity and equity not just in the month of June, but all year round. We’re proud to be different—a different type of company that embraces both our uniqueness and our shared values. Our team is our most precious asset, and we have a responsibility to protect and support our team members so they can achieve their full potential. As we’ve said many times before, “When all your employees feel safe, valued and equal, the rewards and dividends are bountiful.” Not only do we believe this to be true, but our track record of growth, client satisfaction and employee retention clearly confirms it. The sheer joy, enthusiasm and professionalism the entire team shares every day is boundless, and that is our greatest pride. As the conclusion of June Pride draw nears, we hope you’ll take a moment to check out our Facebook page, where we’ll be sharing some thoughts from our team about why Pride matters at Shaw + Scott. Our number one priority at Shaw + Scott is for everyone to “feel the love,” and we hope you’ll feel the love and the pride after reading these, too.

Assuming Success: Best Practices for Email Marketing

Vinca Swanson  May 12,2017  
                                
                                











Often, “best practices” is a term that helps determine the path in designing and building an email campaign. What is the “best practice” to make copy more readable? What are standard “best practices” for overall email width? While best practices are useful, they can also lead to predictable designs. When every element is predicted, projected and produced, email creative comes to feel mundane. And “mundane” is far from what a client is seeking when asking an agency for innovative solutions.

9 Easy to Avoid Email Marketing Mistakes

Kristen Dunleavy  March 29,2017  
                                
                                











Saying “mistakes happen” after you realize you’ve sent a message with an error in it to thousands of recipients doesn’t provide much consolation to email marketers. Yes, mistakes do happen. And they will happen again. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do everything you can to minimize them. Fortunately, with a little forethought (and proofreading) you can head off the most-common email marketing mistakes. Below are nine to watch out for.

5 Emerging Trends in Email Marketing

Rory Carlyle  March 17,2017  
                                
                                











As we round out the first quarter of 2017, it is the perfect time to look back at the year so far and identify email marketing campaign opportunities for the rest of 2017, and beyond. Email as a marketing medium continues to grow, making it increasingly necessary to create separation and differentiation within the inbox.

Holiday Guide Part #1: Create Dazzling Content

Mary Kathleen Sullivan  October 13,2016  
                
                









Looking for some ways to spice up your holiday marketing plan?  Stay tuned to this blog over the next few weeks as we’ll be giving you the golden rules of holiday marketing. We’ll cover topics like: “Creating Dazzling Content Through Videos”, “Focusing on the New Customer Experience”, “How to Create an Omni-Channel Shopping Experience”, “'Wow' Your Customers with Engaging Content", and “Prep for 2017 with a Holiday Recap”.
Great retail campaigns come in all shapes and sizes so be sure to delight your customers with these bright and bold ideas over the next few months.
Golden Rule #1: Create Dazzling Content
With the holidays just around the corner it’s increasingly hard to capture the customer’s attention as you cross another day off the advent calendar. Stores are more crowded, decorations light up the streets, and holiday movies inundate your DVR. With the excitement growing every day it’s hard to stand out from the crowd.
One easy way to capture your shopper’s attention is by creating unboxing videos on YouTube.
These videos not only document the experience of opening a product, but they often dramatize it and, in turn, take on a quirky, playful spirit, showcasing products in all of their shiny new glory.
According to Google Consumer Surveys, unboxing videos have seen a 57% growth from last year on YouTube and one in five consumers report they’ve actually watched an unboxing video. It seems as though the magic of unboxing videos might be connected to the feeling viewers get while watching them.
Regardless of what your product is, a fun video unveiling your product could be just what your brand needs. Make sure your video is practical, giving your customer a look into what they can expect from your product from the moment they open the box, to the moment they hold it in their hands.  
So, think outside the “box” and generate some excitement around your products to connect emotionally with your customers during this holiday season!
Check out these fun and creative unboxing videos for inspiration!
