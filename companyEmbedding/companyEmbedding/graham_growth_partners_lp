Detailed Analysis







Guru Score:
                            43%




SECTOR:  [PASS] CPLP is neither a technology nor financial Company, and therefore this methodology is applicable.  SALES:  [FAIL] The investor must select companies of "adequate size". This includes companies with annual sales greater than $340 million. CPLP's sales of $243.8 million, based on trailing 12 month sales, fail this test.CURRENT RATIO:  [FAIL] The current ratio must be greater than or equal to 2. Companies that meet this criterion are typically financially secure and defensive. CPLP's current ratio of 1.07 fails the test.LONG-TERM DEBT IN RELATION TO NET CURRENT ASSETS:  [FAIL] For industrial companies, long-term debt must not exceed net current assets (current assets minus current liabilities). Companies that do not meet this criterion lack the financial stability that this methodology likes to see. The long-term debt for CPLP is $523.3 million, while the net current assets are $8.3 million. CPLP fails this test.LONG-TERM EPS GROWTH:  [FAIL] Companies must increase their EPS by at least 30% over a ten-year period and EPS must not have been negative for any year within the last 5 years. EPS for CPLP were negative within the last 5 years and therefore the company fails this criterion.P/E RATIO:  [PASS] The Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio, based on the greater of the current PE or the PE using average earnings over the last 3 fiscal years, must be "moderate", which this methodology states is not greater than 15. Stocks with moderate P/Es are more defensive by nature. CPLP's P/E of 11.32 (using the current PE) passes this test.PRICE/BOOK RATIO: [PASS] The Price/Book ratio must also be reasonable. That is, the Price/Book multiplied by P/E cannot be greater than 22. CPLP's Price/Book ratio is 0.51, while the P/E is 11.32. CPLP passes the Price/Book test.
