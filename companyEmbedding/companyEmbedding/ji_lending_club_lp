Lending Club is the world’s largest online credit marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing for elective medical procedures and K-12 education and tutoring. Borrowers access lower interest rate loans through a fast and easy online or mobile interface. Investors provide the capital to enable many of the loans in exchange for earning interest. We operate fully online with no branch infrastructure, and use technology to lower cost and deliver an amazing experience. We pass the cost savings to borrowers in the form of lower rates and investors in the form of attractive returns. We’re transforming the banking system into a frictionless, transparent and highly efficient online marketplace, helping people achieve their financial goals everyday.
Lending Club’s awards include being named a winner of the Economist Innovation awards in the consumer product category, listed on the Inc. 500 in 2014, a CNBC Disruptor 50 two years in a row, one of Forbes’ America’s Most Promising Companies three years in a row, one of The World’s 10 Most Innovative Companies in Finance by Fast Company in 2013 and a 2012 World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.
