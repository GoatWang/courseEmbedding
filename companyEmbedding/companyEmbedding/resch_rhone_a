Rhone Resch is not just the president and CEO of SEIA, the Solar Energy Industries Association; he is also the proud owner of a 6 kW gridtied PV system that powers his home in Washington, D.C. A registered lobbyist with over 15 years of experience working on clean energy development and climate change issues, Rhone is responsible for both SEIA’s operations and implementing its strategic priorities.
—Solar Pro Technical Editor David Brearley spoke on the phone with Rhone the day after President Obama’s inauguration and again after passage of H.R. 1, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, on Feb. 13.
DB: You must be optimistic about working with the new administration. Do you think we will see progress on global warming legislation? What form do you think this legislation is likely to take? And what kind of schedule do you anticipate for a vote? 
	RR: Yes, we are absolutely going to see global warming legislation introduced this year. It will be in the form of a cap-and-trade program. It will be a fairly substantial rewrite of the bills we saw last year. You now have Henry Waxman as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Congressman Ed Markey leading the climate initiative. So you have two very pro command-and-control officials who are going to lead the effort to pass this legislation.
My sense is you will see legislation developed over the course of the next 2 or 3 months that will be very favorable for solar energy. It will include substantial incentives, as well as opportunities for solar to participate in the carbon marketplace. I think the big effort that we are making as an industry is to ensure that those technologies that generate carbon-free electricity are able to monetize that carbonfree generation and to receive credits for it. That certainly hasn’t been the case in the past.





DB: What SEIA asked for in the second round of the stimulus package changed in a meaningful way. The investment tax credit is secured for 8 years, but SEIA announced that it would like to see that credit changed to a tax refund. Can you put this in perspective for our audience? 
	RR: The problem for an economy in a recession is that the typical tax equity players are no longer participating in the tax equity market. In 2007 and 2008, there were about 20 companies that participated in this tax equity market. Today, there are only five. So monetizing the investment tax credit for solar or the production tax credit for wind has become much more complicated and expensive. And even though we had a long-term extension of our tax credits, the economy is making that incentive unusable at this point.
What we have asked Congress and the Administration to do is adjust the tax credits so that they can be used during a recession. Originally, we asked for refundability. This would have meant that if you didn’t pay taxes this year, you could still get 30% of the cost of the system. It would come in the form of a refund from the Treasury. We received a lot of pushback on refundability. If we get that, every industry out there with a business tax credit is going to ask for refundability. Therefore, legislators are unwilling to go there.
Then we said, “What about a grant program?” They are open to the idea of having the tax credit monetized through a direct grant. If you put in a $1 million solar system, you would be eligible for a $300,000 grant from DOE. The catch, of course, is that the solar energy system has to be put into service within 2 years. This is a short-term stimulative measure to try to keep the industry growing.
We have also made some other adjustments to the investment tax credit in this bill that I think are very important—slightly esoteric but very important. The first is subsidized energy financing. If you receive a low interest loan from a community or state program, you have to decrease the basis on which you take the 30% tax credit by the full value of the loan. So if you have a $50,000 system and you get a $50,000 loan—and that loan is at a 2% interest rate—currently you can’t use the federal tax credit. What we have done is remove that subsidized energy financing clause, so if you do receive low interest loans you can still use the 30% tax credit.
This is particularly valuable to a program like the one in Berkeley, California, which is simply the City issuing bonds that it will use to finance the installation of solar in homes and businesses. Homeowners then have an increased property tax assessment on their homes for the amount of the solar system. They can pay that off over time through their property taxes. The beauty of this program is it becomes a very low interest loan to homeowners and small businesses; it removes the upfront cost of installing solar almost completely. If someone were to sell the house or the building, the solar energy system conveys as property to the next owner. You eliminate the whole issue of people not wanting to install solar, thinking they will sell their house within 4 years.

Renewables
SEIA's Resch discusses industry's tough climb on tax credit extensions 

OnPoint
Aired: Tuesday, December 20, 2011

 




 
With Congress overlooking renewable energy tax credit extensions during its final days in session for the year, what are the next steps for the credits and renewable industries?  During today's OnPoint, Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, explains how a lack of the 1603 Treasury grant will impact investments in the solar sector.  He also previews the outlook for the extension of other tax incentives that are set to expire next year.

Transcript

Monica Trauzzi: Hello and welcome to OnPoint. I'm Monica Trauzzi. Joining me today is Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. Rhone, great to have you back on the show.

Rhone Resch: Thank you, Monica, for having me.

Monica Trauzzi: Rhone, it's been a tough climb for the renewable energy industry on tax incentives this year. Senate Finance Chair Max Baucus says he plans to take up tax credits at the beginning of next year.

Rhone Resch: Right.

Monica Trauzzi: But the industry was really hoping to get this resolved sometime this month. What's your take on this new timeline and the fact that we're not going to see an extension this year?

Rhone Resch: We're disappointed. I represent about 5000 businesses in the United States, most of them are small businesses who've been using the 1603 Treasury Program very effectively. This program has supported over 22,000 solar projects across 48 states and so we've gotten to a point where this is an effective job creating mechanism that's about to expire. So, here you have one of the fastest growing industries in the country, we're about to see a significant drop-off when this program expires at the end of the year, so we're disappointed. But, obviously, we're working within the Congress is timeline. We'll be back here in the new year and hopefully it will get it extended. 

Monica Trauzzi: Do you think that there is a majority of support in Congress for the renewables industry and these continued tax extensions?

Rhone Resch: You know, part of the problem, I think with the approach the Congress is taken towards renewables, is they're giving these one year, two-year kinds of extensions rather than making them over a longer duration and then curtailing them after you don't need them. The 1603 program was created to deal with a very tough economic climate where you didn't have enough tax equity in the market to support growth of these industries. Well, this program is still needed today because you don't see those tax equity players have come back into the market yet. So, here we have a very effective program that is absolutely critical that we keep going. I think, in the long run, what you see is that Congress understands this is good policy. This kind of program creates jobs. I'm seeing, you know, development in my district in rural Nevada or in Colorado or in Texas and I never thought the renewable industry would be in my home state. So, you know, here you have a program that's effective and is really supporting job creation throughout United States. Again, difficult to deal with these short-term durations though.

Monica Trauzzi: 1603 brought some impressive numbers for Q3 for the industry. How do you think a lack of that program might affect future growth?

Rhone Resch: Well, it's important to point out the good things that are happening in solar industry today. We grew by 140 percent year over year in the third quarter. We installed about 450 megawatts just in the third quarter. That's more than we installed in the entire year of 2009. So those small businesses, who maybe they're electricians or homebuilders who have gotten into the solar industry, are seeing their business grow and thrive. The big question is what happens January 1? What happens 12 days from now when this program expires? I think for small businesses they're going to find it extremely difficult. If you're a large business you can go to Wall Street and get some tax equity for a 100 million or a $200 million project, but if you're a small developer who's doing 100,000, $200,000 projects, you don't have the ability to go to Wall Street. So they're the ones who are going to be hurt most. We estimate that a one-year extension of this program will create 37,000 additional jobs in the solar industry alone. None of those jobs are going to be created unless 1603 is extended.

Monica Trauzzi: The industry performed at slightly lower than expectations for the year. How do you account for that? Is it the uncertainty that exists right now?

Rhone Resch: Well, growing at 140 percent year over year is pretty good. We're the fastest growing industry in the United States today and I think the other great news is that we've seen the price of solar come down dramatically. As we have scaled up the industry, the cost of solar panels has come down by 40percent in the last year alone. So there's almost no better time to go solar than today. And I think a lot of people are kind of looking at their energy bills going through the roof and saying, hey, solar has come down. It's more cost effective. There's new business models where I don't have to pay them any money upfront. We're going to invest in solar now. So, I would say actually we've done extremely well as an industry, even in these tough economic conditions, in order to grow all market sectors.

Monica Trauzzi: So, with all of this great progress then, why does the industry continue to need these incentives?

Rhone Resch: Well, as you know, Monica, every single sector of the energy industry is built on policy and built on some form of support. For the solar industry we have an underlying 30 percent tax credit that's in place out through 2016. But if you can't use those tax credits to develop your project, you have no ability to finance that project. So the 1603 program was created to address the inadequacies in the market. Those inadequacies still exist today unfortunately and so what I think ultimately is critical is that we create the policies for renewables that are similar to what you see for the oil and gas industry, which are permanent incentives. Or, you know, the kinds of policies that last long enough so you have business certainty, especially for proven job creators like solar.

Monica Trauzzi: Have you noticed a shift in tone in Congress towards renewables and just the outlook for the role that renewables will play in our energy policy?

Rhone Resch: There's no doubt. I mean, you see congressmen starting to talk very positively about solar, not in the future, but today. New factories being opened up throughout the United States, large-scale projects that we couldn't even dream of five years ago are now under construction and, frankly, almost everybody knows somebody working in solar today. That's a big difference from where we were just a couple of years ago. So, we've made a very aggressive transition from being kind of a nice, cute, you know, technology or an issue really into an industry, an industry that employs over 100,000 people in the United States and, as I mentioned, is the fastest-growing industry in this country. And we expect to add another 30 to 40,000 this next year alone, if we have that policy certainty.

Monica Trauzzi: I want to shift gears slightly and talk about the role that China is playing in the U.S. solar industry. Do you think that the U.S. industry is disadvantaged because of China's production of solar technology and its exportation of solar technology?

Rhone Resch: Well, we have a global marketplace for solar, meaning we export and import products here in the United States. In fact, in 2010 we were a net exporter of solar equipment, products and final-finish product, to the tune of having a trade surplus of over $2 billion with the rest of the world. In fact, we were a net exporter to China. Now, what we're seeing is the major investment in new manufacturing of the finished product is occurring in China. And so they've scaled up their manufacturing and lowering their per-unit costs so that they are able to compete globally. Now, unfortunately, we haven't made that same investment in the United States for a lot of companies and so competing with a lower cost product is proving very, very difficult. It's exactly what we saw with Solyndra, where here you had a technology and a business model that was based on a price point in the market. That was good 2008 and 2009 numbers. Well, as I pointed out, the price of solar has come down 40 percent in this last year alone, so you have to be efficient in your manufacturing. You have to lower your costs in order to be cost competitive. And for some companies in the United States, they're not able to do that. A the United States, they're not able to do that. But the same holds true for some companies in China and in Europe and in other places. So, as the cost comes down for solar, there are going to be some companies that go out of business. But, in the long run, that's healthy for us to expand the use of solar and ultimately deliver clean electricity to the customer.

Monica Trauzzi: All right, we'll end it right there. Thank you for coming on the show.

Rhone Resch: Thank you for having me.

Monica Trauzzi: And thanks for watching. We'll see you back here tomorrow.

Giving Life with the Sun: The Darfur Solar Cookers Project 
By Resch, Rhone; Kaye, Noah

Article excerpt

  For the 200,000 displaced citizens of Darfur living in refugee camps in Chad, the simple task of cooking a meal poses serious risks. Since wood for cooking is scarce in the desert region, refugees must travel several miles outside the camp to gather firewood, where they are highly vulnerable to attacks by the Janjaweed militia and other predators. A 2005 report by Medecins Sans Frontieres found that 82 per cent of rape attacks occur when women are outside the populated villages, usually while searching for firewood. But in the Iridimi camp with 17,000 refugees in eastern Chad, families have cut their firewood use by 50 to 80 per cent, using simple solar cookers to prepare their meals.    Most solar cookers work on sunlight being converted to heat energy that is retained for cooking. While there are many successful designs, the most adaptable to the needs of refugees is CooKit, from Solar Cookers International, which is made of cardboard or other local material and is cut into a specific shape to effectively reflect the solar light rays toward a black metal pot. The pot, when painted black on the outside, absorbs and retains solar heat. A clear polypropylene bag tied around it creates an insulating barrier and allows the pot to easily reach 250[degrees] Fahrenheit (about 121[degrees] Celsius), which is more than enough to cook several litres of food in a few hours.    [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]    The KoZon Foundation, a Dutch non-governmental organization that trains women in developing countries to solar-cook, brought the devices to the Iridimi camp for the first time in February 2005, after it obtained funding from the Dutch Foundation for Refugees and a project approval from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). KoZon volunteer, Derk Rijks, and Chadian trainee, Marie-Rose Neloum, provided 100 cookers to several women refugees for a demonstration, which proved to be a success.    A second demonstration was organized in April 2005, in which KoZon trained and tested the ability of the refugees themselves to manufacture 120 cookers, emphasizing the creation of a self-sustaining economic activity. A basic workshop, completed in February 2006, provided the necessary tools and space for the manufacture of the cookers. Several refugees were also trained as "auxiliary trainers", who would teach others how to solar-cook.    The Solar Cooker Project accelerated in May 2006, when a coalition of 55 synagogues in southern California in the United States, the Jewish World Watch (JWW), stepped in to fund the large-scale introduction of the cookers throughout the Iridimi camp. …

Rhone Resch joins Sunworks Board of Directors
































































Solar Power World
Rhone Resch joins Sunworks Board of Directors
By Kelly Pickerel | October 27, 2016Sunworks, a provider of solar power solutions for commercial and residential markets, announced today the appointment of Rhone A. Resch as an independent director. The new appointment will be effective on November 1, 2016 and expand the size of the Sunworks board to eight members.

Mr. Resch brings more than 20 years of senior management experience and relevant solar industry experience to Sunworks’ Board of Directors. He has an extensive background in strategic planning, market analysis, business development and operations that support the rapid growth of solar companies. He is a highly recognized spokesman on solar industry issues, including legislative, executive and regulatory actions.
“We are excited and honored to welcome Rhone to our board of directors and believe his industry expertise and corporate leadership experience will significantly enhance our efforts to strategically scale our business and expand our footprint with in the solar industry,” said Jim Nelson, CEO of Sunworks. “There are few individuals who carry the understanding of solar that Rhone does and bringing the benefits of his expertise to Sunworks will give us an incredible advantage. We look to the future with anticipation and expect to see our vision for the Company widened even further as we incorporate Rhone’s talents.”
Mr. Resch has served as President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the national trade association for the solar energy industry representing over 1,000 companies that manufacture, develop and install solar systems of all sizes and technologies. In this role, he was responsible for leading the growth of the industry by expanding markets, removing market barriers, increasing the availability of low cost financing and educating the public. Under Rhone’s leadership, SEIA’s recent legislative successes include the long-term extension and expansion of the investment tax credits for solar enacted at the end of 2015, creation of the Treasury grant program and the section 48C manufacturing tax credit, and expansion of the loan guarantee program for renewable energy. At the state level, SEIA has been the lead in expanding net metering, establishing strong renewable portfolio standards and creating markets for residential, commercial and utility scale solar energy. And in the regulatory arena, Rhone recently led the industry through an adverse customs ruling, guiding the industry through a complex legal, framework that saved U.S. companies several hundred million dollars. He has over 18 years of experience in the public and private sector working in clean energy development and climate change issues. In addition to serving as the Vice President for the Natural Gas Supply Association, Rhone has also served as Program Manager at the EPA’s Climate Protection Division during the Clinton administration.
“Having had broad exposure to the industry, I feel that Sunworks is uniquely positioned in the solar industry to grow rapidly and profitably and provide a level of service and professionalism that is unique in any industry,” commented Mr. Resch. “The future is clear, solar companies with a strong focus on quality, customer service and value are going to beat the large national solar companies. I am excited to work with the board to help management leverage their strategic advantages to continue to deliver growth that outpaces the industry.”
Mr. Resch holds an MPA in Management from Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, a Master of Environmental Engineering from SUNY Syracuse, and a B.A. from the University of Michigan.
