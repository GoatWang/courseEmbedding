 Celgene's Robert J. Hugin Becomes PhRMA Board Chairman; Ian C. Read, Kenneth C. Frazier Assume New Posts 
 Fri, 04/12/2013 - 1:40pm 
 Comments 
 by  

 



Robert J. Hugin, chairman and CEO of Celgene Corporation, was elected chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) today at the trade association's annual meeting. Also elected were Ian C. Read, president and CEO of Pfizer Inc, as chairman-elect of the PhRMA Board of Directors, and Kenneth C. Frazier, Chairman, President and CEO of Merck & Co, Inc., as Board treasurer.
Mr. Hugin succeeds John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president, and CEO of Eli Lilly and Company, as PhRMA's chairman.
"John Lechleiter's tireless leadership over the past year has helped to reinvigorate the biopharmaceutical research sector at a time when a challenging public policy environment threatens to put America's global leadership in medical innovation at risk," said PhRMA President and CEO John J. Castellani. "As Bob Hugin assumes the chairmanship, I know he will continue to emphasize the importance of patient-centered policies that properly value medicines, incentivize innovation and provide a strong foundation for the millions of U.S. jobs our industry creates and supports." Mr. Hugin became CEO of Celgene Corporation in June of 2010 having served as president and chief operating officer since May 2006. In June 2011, the Celgene Board of Directors elected Mr. Hugin chairman.
He was instrumental in the strategic growth of the company, overseeing the expansion of Celgene from a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company to a global company with operations in more than 50 countries located in the Americas, Europe, Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. He joined Celgene as senior vice president and chief financial officer in June 1999 and was elected to the Board of Directors in December 2001.
"I look forward to working with our leadership team, the PhRMA staff, and our member companies to advocate for policies that support the advancement of medical innovation and that ensure access for patients to life-extending therapies," Mr. Hugin said.  "Through our actions, we must ensure that continued medical innovation is part of the solution to healthcare costs and economic growth in the long term." Mr. Read is the chairman and CEO of Pfizer. He began his career with Pfizer in 1978 as an operational auditor. Mr. Read worked in Latin America through 1995, holding positions in a number of Pfizer's international operations. In 1996, he was appointed president of Pfizer's International Pharmaceuticals Group, with responsibility for Latin America and Canada. He became executive vice president, Europe in 2000, and was named a corporate vice president in 2001. In 2006, he became senior vice president, Pfizer, and group president of the Worldwide Biopharmaceutical Businesses.
"The biopharmaceutical industry's efforts to discover and develop innovative new medicines not only has a significant impact in saving and improving lives, but is also an essential driver of the broader economy," Mr. Read said. "PhRMA is committed to working with policymakers, elected officials and our members to develop the right policy framework that supports innovation that results in creating value for society by enhancing productivity and improving the quality of life globally." Mr. Frazier is chairman, president and CEO of Merck & Co. Previously, he served as president of Merck with responsibility for the company's three major divisions: Global Human Health, Merck's sales and marketing division for pharmaceutical and vaccine products; Merck Manufacturing, the company's manufacturing and supply division; and Merck Research Laboratories, Merck's research organization. Mr.
Frazier received his bachelor's degree from The Pennsylvania State University and holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School.
"Congratulations to my colleagues who have made many outstanding contributions to healthcare and our industry through their work with PhRMA. I look forward to continuing my work with PhRMA to ensure that patients and caregivers benefit from the many scientific advances that the pharmaceutical industry has to offer," said Mr. Frazier.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) represents the country's leading innovative biopharmaceutical research and biotechnology companies, which are devoted to discovering and developing medicines that enable patients to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Since 2000, PhRMA member companies have invested approximately $550 billion in the search for new treatments and cures, including an estimated $48.5 billion in 2012 alone.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
