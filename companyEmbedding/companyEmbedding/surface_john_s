This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Our Favorite Under-$500 Laptops












Time to Digitize: Top-Rated Photo Scanners
















Intel Core i5-7640X

07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Core i5 member of Intel's new Core X family offers little advantage over Intel's mainstream chips despite the need for a costly motherboard.










Asus GeForce GTX 1060 OC Edition (9Gbps GDDR5)

07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Asus GeForce GTX 1060 OC Edition is a good choice if you're looking for improved 3D performance on older titles, and should fare well in some 4K and most VR gameplay.










MSI GP62X Leopard Pro


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Despite a crisp display and a slim build, the MSI GP62X Leopard Pro's performance lags behind other midrange gaming laptops.










Simvoly


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Simvoly offers easy-to-use tools for building a good-looking, responsive-design site with a respectable level of customizability.










Symantec Norton Security Deluxe (for Mac)


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Symantec's Norton Security Deluxe delivers excellent Mac antivirus protection with a powerful firewall, and you can use your licenses to protect your Android, iOS, and Windows devices, too.










Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac excels in independent lab tests, and it goes far beyond mere antivirus, offering protection against network attacks, parental control, privacy protection, and many other useful features.










Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac gets top marks from the independent labs and in our own hands-on testing. With its handy Autopilot mode, you can set it, forget it, and have confidence that your Apple computer is protected against malware.










Sophos Home (for Mac)


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Sophos Home keeps configuration to a minimum and scores well in independent lab tests and our own hands-on tests. It's excellent at protecting your Macs from malware, for free.










Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus (for Mac)


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: While it may not be the best protection against phishing websites, Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus (for Mac) is by far the fastest Mac antivirus scanner we've seen.










McAfee AntiVirus Plus (for Mac)


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: For the same price that gets you three licenses of many competitors, a McAfee subscription gives you unlimited licenses to protect all your Macs with McAfee AntiVirus Plus (for Mac), and your Windows, Android, and iOS devices as well.










Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: AV-Test certifies Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac's ability to fight malware, and it includes some useful bonus features. But its multi-license pricing isn't practical for all-Apple households and a full scan took hours in testing.










ESET Cyber Security (for Mac)


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Two independent testing labs certify ESET Cyber Security's malware-busting skills, and it offers more help and training options than many Mac security products.










Intego Mac Internet Security X9


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Intego Mac Internet Security X9 scores well in lab tests using Mac malware, and it offers firewall protection. But it fails against Windows malware and lacks protection against dangerous URLs.










Avira Free Antivirus for Mac


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Avira Free Antivirus for Mac costs nothing, and one lab certifies its macOS protection, but it's not the best free Mac antivirus we've tested.










QNAP TS-253B


Editors' Rating: good
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The two-bay QNAP TS-253B is a highly expandable network-attached storage (NAS) device that offers plenty of advanced features and a user-friendly interface.










Google Project Fi


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.28.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Google's Project Fi combines Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular into a into a virtual network with better coverage than any one of the three offers individually, but you need a Google Pixel phone to use it.

Amazon Fire HD 10
07.05.2017


Editors' Rating: fair



 

at 




Bottom Line: Amazon's Fire HD 10 tablet serves up access to all the Amazon content you could possibly want, but its clunky form factor, subpar screen, and higher price place it a step behind the smaller Fire HD 8. 






Amazon Fire HD 8 (2017)

07.05.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Amazon's latest Fire HD 8 tablet is a great value for media consumption, as long as you can live without access to Google Play. 






Amazon Fire 7 (2017)
07.05.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The Amazon Fire 7 tablet makes a good basic video player and color ebook reader, and it's very easy to use. 






Alcatel A30 Tablet
06.28.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: The Alcatel A30 for T-Mobile isn't particularly exciting, but it's a solid 8-inch Android tablet for the price, especially if you need cellular connectivity. 






Apple iPad Pro (10.5-Inch)
06.20.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Apple's 10.5-inch iPad Pro tablet packs as much power as a laptop, but using iOS for pro-level applications will take some getting used to for many professionals. 
















Acer Iconia One 7 (B1-780-K610)
06.15.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: The Acer Iconia One 7 is a very affordable Android tablet with a nice display, but some performance issues hold it back. 






Microsoft Surface Pro

06.15.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: With faster performance, better battery life, and other welcome improvements over its predecessor, the Microsoft Surface Pro is still the standard bearer for 2-in-1 Windows tablets. 






Samsung Galaxy Book (12-Inch, LTE)
06.06.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Samsung's Galaxy Book is a high-end 2-in-1 convertible with a gorgeous Super AMOLED screen and category-leading battery life. But it could use a bump up in memory and storage to merit its $1,300 price tag. 






Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1
05.30.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The Dell Latitude 5285 is a capable business-focused 2-in-1 Windows tablet with Core i7-processor power and enough battery life to last well into overtime. It could easily replace your work laptop. 






Lenovo Tab3 8
05.25.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: The Lenovo Tab3 8 is a sturdy and relatively affordable Android tablet with built-in parental controls, but it doesn't offer particularly noteworthy performance.

How Much Will Microsoft's Surface Tablet Cost?

The big question is whether Microsoft's beautifully designed Surface tablet will sell well, but that's impossible to predict without knowing its price.

Microsoft held an event yesterday in Hollywood and, as far as I can tell, only invited those who would cover the event with a positive spin. (I, for example was not invited.) Then, the company insulted the invitees by withholding the location of the eventwhich turned out to be Milk Studiosuntil about six hours before it began.


The idea was to create an Apple-like event with an Apple-like product. And, according to attendees, it was peopled by Microsoft shills who whooped it up just like the Apple folks do at their events.


We actually need less of these pretentious events. Microsoft did, in fact, reveal a cool product. It apparently went out of its way to throw off the "it has no taste" albatross and rolled out an incredible tablet device that is in the same designer heavyweight league as, not Apple, but Bang & Olufsen.


Ladies and gentlemen I bring you the Surface: a tablet ultrabook thingee!


Congratulations, Microsoft, you went over the top with this one. You proved you could hang with the big design dogs. Woof, woof, woof.


Most of the pre-event speculation did not predict branded Microsoft hardware. Mine did, though, since I knew the company needed something to show off at the Microsoft stores that are cropping up everywhere. So, it has this in October. I expect more and more branded products coming in the next year, all to sell at the stores.


Nobody anywhere apparently had any connections to any companies, making the highlight of the evening the TouchCover, which turns the pad into an ersatz ultrabook. It's a clever idea that has the bonus of inviting carpal tunnel syndrome and lawsuits. But the company can deal with that by using a warning sticker.


The question is not whether Microsoft knocked it out of the park design-wise, because it is a grand-slam, nor is the question why it rolled this out in Hollywood, though the venue did generate some buzz. The real question is whether these things will sell.


I hope to God they sell like hotcakes so Microsoft will maintain a high standard for design, but I fear the opposite. Expensive-looking design has a drawback: it is generally expensive. That's kind of the problem. To keep the prices reasonable, one must employ a lot of cheap tricks, like using glue inside to mount components. (I'm looking at you, Apple.)


From the looks of it, there are no cheap tricks with this device. The biggest complaint from live bloggers at the event is that no price was announced. All Microsoft could say was that it would be "competitive." But competitive with what? A Burger King cheeseburger?

Ballmer has never been one for low-balling the competition. He cannot bring himself to do it. He's a multi-billionaire who is out of touch with the public. He doesn't mingle anymore. He's the perfect customer for Bang & Olufsen.


I'll bet that the price we'll have to pay for this Surface machine will be disappointing and the sales will be meager. I'm hoping I am wrong.


This much is for sure: if Microsoft took an early beating by pricing the low-end Surface running Windows 8 RT at $299 and the high-end Intel machine at $429, it would blow out the market and make up for it in volume sales.


But if I were to guess the prices for the two units based on the crazy desire to make a profit on zero sales, I suspect the low-end tablet with keyboard will go for $499 and the high-end machine will tip the scales at $799 or more.


Unless the economy improves by 2013, the great experiment in high-end industrial design will fall flat and these devices will wind up in the Museum of Modern Art.
