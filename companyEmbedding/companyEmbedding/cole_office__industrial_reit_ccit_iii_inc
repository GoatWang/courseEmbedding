Sep 27, 2016, 6:00am EDT














PHOENIX, Sept. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc.

Located within the Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan area, the four-story property is well-located near major transportation routes.
"The credit quality of the tenant, scheduled rent growth, remaining lease term and the strategic operations of the facility demonstrate the strong real estate attributes that CCIT III seeks in its property acquisitions," said Bill Miller, Chief Executive Officer and President of Cole Capital.
