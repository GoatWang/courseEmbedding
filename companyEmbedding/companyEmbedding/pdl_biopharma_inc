About PDL
PDL > About PDL








PDL BioPharma (NASDAQ: PDLI) seeks to provide a significant return for its shareholders by acquiring and managing a portfolio of companies, products, royalty agreements and debt facilities in the biotech, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. In late 2012, PDL began providing alternative sources of capital through royalty monetization and debt facilities and in 2016, began making equity investments in commercial stage companies, the first being Noden Pharma DAC.
PDL evaluates its investments based on the quality of the income generating assets and potential returns on investment. PDL is currently focused on acquiring new income generating assets, with an emphasis on diversification via acquisition of additional specialty pharma products, or companies with a focus on under commercialized products. With this emphasis, PDL expects fewer future investments in royalty transactions and still fewer debt investments.
The company was formerly known as Protein Design Labs, Inc. and changed its name to PDL BioPharma, Inc. in 2006. PDL was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Incline Village, Nevada. PDL pioneered the humanization of monoclonal antibodies and, by doing so, enabled the discovery of a new generation of targeted treatments for cancer and immunologic diseases for which it previously received significant royalty revenue.

					Full Description



PDL BioPharma, Inc., incorporated on July 24, 1986, seeks to provide return for its shareholders by acquiring and managing a portfolio of companies, products, royalty agreements and debt facilities in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Company's segments include income generating assets and product sales. The income generating assets segment consists of royalties from issued patents in the United States and elsewhere, covering the humanization of antibodies, which it refers to as the Queen et al. patents; notes and other long-term receivables, royalty rights-at fair value and equity investments. The Company's product sales segment consists of revenue derived from Tekturna, Tekturna HCT, Rasilez and Rasilez HCT (collectively, the Noden Products or Tekturna) sales. The Company is focused on the acquisition of additional products, and expects to transact royalty transactions and debt transactions.Product SalesThe Company holds the worldwide rights to manufacture, market, and sell the branded prescription medicine product sold under the name Tekturna and Tekturna HCT in the United States, and Rasilez and Rasilez HCT in the rest of the world. Tekturna (or Rasilez outside the United States) contains aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, for the treatment of hypertension. Tekturna HCT (or Rasilez HCT outside the United States) is a combination of aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, for the treatment of hypertension in patients not controlled by monotherapy and as an initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals. It is not indicated for use with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in-patient with diabetes or renal impairment and not for use in patients with known anuria or hypersensitivity to sulfonamide-derived drugs.Income Generating AssetsThe Company acquires income-generating assets. These income-generating assets are typically in the form of notes receivables, royalty rights and hybrid notes/royalties receivable and in some cases, equity. The Company primarily focuses its income generating asset acquisition strategy on commercial-stage therapies and medical devices having economic fundamentals. The Company receives royalty revenue from a product under the Queen et al. patent licenses, Tysabri. As of December 31, 2016, it had a total of five notes receivable transactions outstanding and one note/royalty (hybrid) receivable transaction outstanding.

Better Buy: PDL BioPharma, Inc. vs. Johnson & Johnson
These two healthcare stocks have more differences than similarities. Find out which is the better pick right now.











                Cory Renauer
            

                (TMFang4apples)



            
            Feb 27, 2017 at 9:43AM
            
            





Biotech finance specialist PDL Biopharma (NASDAQ:PDLI) has been suffering a prolonged market thrashing that's driven its stock price down about 75% over the past three years. Over the same period, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock has kept pace with the buoyant broad-market S&P 500 index.
If PDL Biopharma selling has gone too far, a turnaround could lead to market-beating gains. Should investors ignore J&J's relative safety in favor of the riskier value play?
Let's have a closer look at these unique healthcare stocks to see which comes out ahead right now.

Arguments for PDL Biopharma
This company has had an extremely tough year. Until recently, it was able to pay investors a juicy dividend with profit derived from patents covering some of the world's best-selling drugs. However, the Queen et al. patent family expired at the end of 2014, and revenue derived from the patent family plunged to just $15.0 million in the third quarter last year, from $119.2 during the same period a year earlier.
PDL Biopharma has made some progress reducing its dependence on the once-lucrative royalty stream from the Queen patents, but nowhere enough to offset the loss. Third-quarter revenue came in at just $53.6 million for a 57% year-on-year decline for the period.
Last July, PDL Biopharma committed $107 million to an equity stake in Noden Pharma and exclusive worldwide rights to a hypertension medication branded Tekturna in the U.S. and Rasilez everywhere else. In 2015, the drug generated $154 million in sales while marketed by Novartis, although during the three months ended in September, PDL recorded just $14.1 million in total product revenue.
Investors will want to keep their eyes open for the first full quarter of Tekturna sales. Achieving or surpassing the high-water mark set by the drug's previous owner could help the stock bounce back somewhat. Further ahead, reinstatement of the dividend it scrapped last year could provide another boost.
Arguments for Johnson & Johnson
In many ways, the world's largest healthcare company is the polar opposite of PDL Biopharma. Remicade is its best-selling product by a mile, but the $6.97 billion in sales it generated last year comprised just 9.7% of the company's enormous top line.
In the quarters ahead, investors will want to keep an eye on Remicade sales. Late last year, Pfizer launched Inflectra, the first domestically-available biosimilar version of the megablockbuster. Biosimilars have been digging into international sales of the drug for years, but Remicade generates the majority of its sales in the U.S.
At a 15% discount to Remicade's U.S. list price, Inflectra will almost certainly pressure its sales. The behemoth has a good chance of more than offsetting the losses with new products emerging from its late-stage pipeline. The company boasts three of the world's 15 most highly valued drugs expected to reach pharmacy shelves this year. The FDA is reviewing applications for guselkumab as a potential new psoriasis treatment and the rheumatoid arthritis candidate sirukumab. If approved, the pair is expected to generate a $2.3 billion in combined annual sales by 2022.
A bit further out, apalutamide is an interesting prostate cancer candidate that could add another $1.5 billion to J&J's top line by 2022. The company intends to submit applications for treatment of early-stage prostate cancer later this year.





Running the numbers
At its beaten-down price of around 2.1 times trailing earnings, PDL Biopharma looks insanely cheap. If successful commercialization of Tekturna restores some confidence in the company's otherwise dismal-looking future, there could be some gains ahead.
Before you jump at PDL's stock, though, you should consider the $150 million in convertible notes it issued late last year to refinance an existing debt. In a nutshell, those notes could be converted into shares that would heavily dilute your share of any future profits, driving the stock much lower.

Johnson & Johnson shares offer a nice 2.7% dividend yield at recent prices that you can reasonably expect to continue marching upwards well into your retirement. It's been 54 years since the company went more than a year without raising its dividend payment, and it's managed to increase adjusted earnings for an outstanding 33 consecutive years.
At 20.2 times trailing earnings, shares of Johnson & Johnson aren't exactly cheap, but they're far less likely to lead to losses over the long run. That's makes it a much better buy than PDL Biopharma right now.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Finding lifesaving medicines is a life's work – the work of 140,000 researchers who never say never. As well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.
