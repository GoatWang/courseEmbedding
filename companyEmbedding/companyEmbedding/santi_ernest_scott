Welcome and thank you all for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today’s conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.
Now I will turn the meeting over to your host Aaron Hoffman. Sir, you may begin.
Aaron Hoffman
Thanks, Evan. Good morning and welcome to ITW’s first quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today’s call, we will discuss our first quarter 2016 financial results and update you on our 2016 earnings forecast.
Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2016 second quarter and full-year, as well as other forward-looking statements identified on this slide. We refer you to the company’s 2015 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. While we use very few non-GAAP measures a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained in the press release.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Scott.
Ernest Scott Santi
Thanks, Aaron, and good morning. Overall a pretty solid start to the year for ITW as we delivered solid near-term results and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy to position the company to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns.
In the quarter we continued to deliver meaningful improvement on all of our key performance metrics. We grew EPS 7%, 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, organic growth came in at the midpoint of our forecast and was up 1%, 2% excluding the impact of our PLS initiatives. We improved operating margin by 120 basis points to 22.1% and increased after tax return on invested capital by 180 basis points to 21.2%. Both our operating margin and our ROIC metrics were new all-time first quarter highs for the company.
Free cash flow was also strong in the quarter at 90% of net income. Based on current demand trends and our strong operational and margin performance in the quarter we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance for 2016 by $0.05 at the midpoint.
Before turning the call over Michael for more detail on our Q1 results I’d like to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and executing our strategy.
Michael, over to you.
Michael Larsen
Thank you, Scoot and good morning, everybody. As you saw this morning ITW is off to a strong start in 2016 as the company delivered another solid quarter with excellent quality of earnings.
GAAP EPS of $1.29 increased 7% versus prior year and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.04. Driven by better operating margin as a result of strong operational execution on our enterprise initiatives.
Organic revenue was up 1% and in line with our guidance as North America grew 2% and international declined 1%. As Scott mentioned, we established a number of new all-time highs for our first quarter. Operating margin of 22.1% improved 120 basis points with strategic sourcing, 80-20 practice excellence and business structure simplification all contributing in a very meaningful way.

Given the strong margin performance in the quarter we now expect that operating margin will exceed 22.5% for the full year. Operating income of $722 million was also a first quarter record. The prior record of $705 million was pre-enterprise strategy in 2012 and was achieved with revenues that were about $1.3 billion higher in this quarter.
After tax ROIC was solid, fee cash flow was strong and we repurchased shares for $500 million. Just a comment on our external financial reporting. As you know, at ITW, we work hard to keep our external reporting simple, consistent and transparent. We only report one EPS number and that is GAAP EPS. There are no adjusted EPS numbers. That said, let me just point out two items that are included in our first quarter GAAP EPS number of $1.29.
First, foreign currency translation, which was right in line with our guidance assumption an unfavorable $0.04 year-over-year. Second, last year’s first quarter included a non-recurring gain on the sale of our business. As a result, in the first quarter of last year, other income was $21 million compared to $4 million this quarter. Excluding these two items, EPS would have increased 13%.
We strongly believe that in the current economic environment and over the long-term our highly profitable and diversified portfolio is the core strength of the company. We are very well balanced in terms of our end-market and geographic exposures and well positioned to perform at a high level across a wide range of economic scenarios. Our consumer facing businesses makeup 60% of our revenues and include the automotive OEM and food equipment segments as well as portions of specialty products and construction.
These businesses continue to deliver stable high quality growth. In the first quarter, our consumer facing businesses were up 3% versus prior year and up 1% sequentially. Our industrial facing businesses such as welding and test and measurement and electronics account for 40% of our revenues and as expected they declined year-over-year. As you can see these businesses were now 3%, but showed some improvement versus Q4 when they were down 6%. As you know the year-over-year comparisons continue to ease as we go through the year.
1% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 2% excluding our Product Line Simplification initiatives or PLS. By region, North America was up 2%, with our consumer-facing businesses up 5%. Solid growth continues in food equipment up 5%, automotive up 4% and construction products with renovation remodeling up 22%.
Industrial facing businesses were down 3%, with welding down 7% and test and measurement and electronics down 1%. On the international side overall down 1%, with Europe up 1% and Asia-Pac down 2%. Our international consumer businesses grew 1% and industrial was down 4% primarily due to welding.
At ITW we believe that operating margin is a key indicator of our business as competitive advantage and the efficiency with which they leverage it. It is in our view a compelling indicator of the strength and competitiveness of ITW and is a key performance metric for every ITW business. In the first quarter, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 22.1% and six of our seven segments improved. Construction products increased 440 basis points, specialty products 350 basis points, food equipment 190 basis points and automotive was up 140 basis points to mention a few.
Approximately half of the decline in welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other non-operating items and the team continues to do a good job in a challenging environment as evidenced by their ability to sustain operating margins in the mid-20s despite a significant decline in revenue. You can also see the positive impact of volume leverage in the faster growing segments, which gives you a sense for what margins and overall profitability will look like as organic growth picks up.

On the right side of the page, we listed the drivers of our operating margin improvement this quarter starting with 130 basis points from our self-help enterprise initiatives. Given the strong performance, and positive momentum, we are now expecting more than 100 basis points in the enterprise initiatives this year.
Price cost came in as expected stable and favorable at 20 basis points. The unfavorable 50 basis points in the other line is primarily related to investments in growth and the overhead inflation. Overall, continued strong execution on enterprise initiatives and progress on delivering best-in-class margins consistently and sustainably.
Before we get into the segment results, we listed the quarterly progression on operating margin expansion since the first quarter of 2013. 520 basis points at the enterprise level, as you can see Construction improved 930 basis points, 780 basis points in food equipment and more than 600 basis points in Automotive and Specialty Products, overall good progress with more to come.
Turning to the segments, Automotive OEM had another strong quarter with organic revenue up 3% and 26.4% operating margin. While 3% organic growth is a little below what we’ve seen out of our Automotive OEM segment over the last several quarters, this segment had a very tough comp and Q1 revenue came in right what we planned it to be.
In the first quarter of last year, the launch of several new programs in Europe resulted in revenue growth of 13% versus builds of 2%, which is what created tough comp for the business this year.
Our long-term growth target for our Automotive OEM business remains 2 to 4 percentage points of above market growth annually and based on already sold programs and our new programs pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed that target both in 2016 and for at least the next several years beyond.
In North America 4% organic growth compares to auto builds of up 5% and the Detroit 3 up 4%. China was up 6% in the quarter despite the fact the builds at Western OEMs were down slightly. As expected operating margin improved 140 basis points to 26.4% the highest in the company.
The quick update on the acquisition of EF&C from ZF TRW that we announced last quarter. The acquisition remains on track and we expect the deal to close mid-year. As a reminder EF&C should be modestly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months with accelerating benefit from 2017 and beyond.
Another strong quarter in Food Equipment up 3% organically with strength in North America up 5% despite a challenging comparison. North America equipment was up 5% with strength in refrigeration and cooking and the service was up 4%.
International was up 1% with equipment up 3% and service flat. Continued strong margin performance as operating margin improved by 190 basis points to 24.5%. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue down 2%, Test & Measurement down 3% and electronics slightly better at down 1%. Sequentially the segment was stable down 7% compared to typical seasonality of down 6%. Still a challenging external environment for our welding business and organic growth declined 9%. The 9% year-over-year decline breaks down as 5 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 1 point from commercial.
North America was down 7% with equipment down 10% and consumables down 1%. International was down 15% primarily due to oil and gas. We saw some slowing sequentially with demand trends down 3% compared to the typical 3% increase and the team continues to take appropriate action on the cost side. As I mentioned earlier approximately half of the operating margin declined in welding this quarter is related to restructuring and other non-operating items.
Polymers & Fluids achieved positive organic revenue growth of 1%; North America and international were both up 1% and Automotive aftermarket improved 2%. Strong quarter in Construction Products as organic revenue increased 5% with North America up 11%. Renovation remodeling was up 22%, commercial was up 8% and residential was up 2%. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Europe flat, very strong progress on operating margin up 440 basis points to 21%. Solid quarter in Specialty Products with organic revenue up 3% with strength in our consumer packaging businesses, North America was up 5% and international was flat and very strong progress on operating margin with an increase of 350 basis points to 26.1%.

So for the year based on our margin performance in the first quarter, we are raising of full-year EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $5.40 to $5.60, the $5.50 midpoint is 7% earnings growth. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is unchanged and in line with current run rates.
We’re forecasting that enterprise initiatives will deliver more than 100 basis points of margin improvement and that full year operating margin will exceed 22.5%. We still expect free cash flow conversion to exceed 100% and we are targeting $2 billion in share repurchases. For the second quarter our GAAP EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.44, up 7% at the $1.39 midpoint. That puts 49% of our full year EPS forecast into first half of the year which is consistent with prior years.
And with that, let me turn the call back to Aaron.
Aaron Hoffman
Great. Thanks, Michael. We will now open the call to your question. Please be brief so to allow more people the opportunity to ask a question and please remember one question and one follow-up question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
John Inch
Thank you. Where am I from, alright? First I want to thank you by the way for the GAAP presentation of earnings and frankly for doing a call and not a selective disclosure podcast. So much appreciated. Can we and don’t answer that, can we just talk about currency Michael? I know you said it was in line with expectations. It was a little bit more of a drag. Just based on where we were marking currencies that we thought would happen in the quarter. So was there I realized got a lot of exposure to Australian dollar and I don’t know, just with the pound and so forth, maybe could you talk about just give us a little more color in terms of the currency fluctuation and where you’ve marked this for the rest of the year and how you expect that to progress in terms of driver your contribution?
Michael Larsen
Right, John. So you are headed down the right path here. So you have to look beyond just the euro and if you look at the changes in pound, Canadian and Australian dollar that’s when you get to the 3% translation impact here in the first quarter on the top-line and $0.04 of EPS headwind, which was right in lined with the assumption we had in our guidance.
For the rest of the year that translation impact will at current rates as we sit here today will be lower and maybe if you headed down the path of EPS impact for the balance of the year, it is correct, but based on current rates as we sit here today not just looking at the euro, but at the other currency that we mentioned. If currency stays exactly where it is, things could turn out a little bit better.
But as you know there is a lot of volatility in currency. So we have not included that in the numbers we gave you today.
John Inch
Okay. But you did beat the midpoint of your guide by almost $0.05 and...
Michael Larsen
Yes and that is entirely driven by operating margins.
John Inch
Right. No I see....
Michael Larsen
So the....
John Inch
No, it's right. I see that. But at current rates how much of a tailwind we have in currency today versus what we had when you first marked rates giving the first quarter in your head guidance, isn’t it like $0.05 or something?
Michael Larsen
I just say this, it’s a little bit better than what we had assumed and that’s as we sit here today. Let’s see where rates go from here. Like I said it could be a little bit better based on rates as they are today.
John Inch
Okay. So my follow-up, I want to ask you and Scott. What do you think of the or what do you make of the ISM it saw that everyone seems to look at and if you look at the new orders component. I mean it sort of telling you that a big recovery is on the comp. Now last year was flashing green and manufacturing was going the other way. So I think I’m just trying to get your sense, you are a real time company short cycle you are in the economy, do you think that the ISM is reflecting perhaps some seasonal improvement, some sentiment improvement only perhaps a little bit of systematic inventory restock or are you just seeing a complete disconnect? I just want again focus on North America please and how do you based in your years of experience, how do you interpret the ISM and why frankly wouldn’t you be even more positive on your outlook?

Ernest Scott Santi
We’ve never from our particular lens we’ve never viewed the ISM number as having a terrific correlation to conditions we’re seeing on the ground, certainly not way off, but I think from the standpoint of either leading or lagging, it’s not been particularly reflective of the conditions that we’re seeing, what I will tell is, my take on the quarter is that we saw a pretty solid demands throughout. So I think things are relatively firm for right now, the one exception to that is obviously welding, we’re hopefully, we’re getting to close a bottom, but I can’t say that we’re seeing anything that tells us that, but beyond that the overall demand profile inside the company was pretty solid as we move through the quarter. So no big movement and certainly not any weakening as we move through the quarter.
John Inch
Well, Scott every month has its own seasonal characteristics and we had this weather compares, especially in the Midwest, it's [indiscernible] because I realize, it’s complicated, but if you try and adjust for all that do you think that underlying demand is picking up for your businesses or is it still not clear? Like if you look at things of how the quarter progressed and then into April.
Ernest Scott Santi
Yeah. I’d say it’s been pretty firm. I think it’s a little early in a quarter to call with one quarters worth of data, but I think again in the aggregate things were pretty solid through the quarter, look at our consumer facing businesses where the overall demand rates have been pretty solid going back, you know, four or five quarters now, I think we’re feeling good about where we sit in the kind of the overall demand picture that we saw in the first quarter. That being said it’s still a pretty choppy environment out there, but there was no new worry beats based on our first quarter performance that we saw across the company.
John Inch
Okay. So basically signs are very stable, but no sort of obvious inflections of sequential improvement on the comp right again adjusting for seasonality.
Ernest Scott Santi
No.
John Inch
Okay, good enough. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joseph Ritchie
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Ernest Scott Santi
Good morning.
Joseph Ritchie
So I guess, my first question is on Auto, again first, solid quarter, but clearly you guys had a really, really tough comp, especially if you look on a two year stack. Is the expectations that growth starts to improve beyond the first quarter on your auto business just based on what you know on production schedules and where in the platforms that you are on?
Michael Larsen
Yeah. So I think, you know, we talked about a tough comp in the first quarter due to the new programs launched in Europe and if you recall Europe last year was up 11% on builds of 1. So that comp will be with us for the year, but in terms of the year-over-year organic growth rate, as we sit here today looking at the typical seasonality Q1 is the low-point for the year and the organic growth rate on a year-over-year basis will improve as we go through the year.
Joseph Ritchie
Okay, great. Thanks Michael. And maybe my following question moving onto Welding so clearly the part of your portfolio there has been a little bit more challenge, you guys mentioned half of the margin performance this quarter was related to restructuring action, does that start to tail-off as we progress through the year or how were you thinking about that business? I guess clearly on the face of it when you take a look at the detrimental, detrimental margins in the first quarter are pretty high, just trying to get a sense for how that business will project for the rest of the year?

Michael Larsen
Yeah. So we had as you said about half of the impact in the first quarter here the margin decline down 9%, which is a pretty significant organic, about half of that was restructuring related. We expect a similar impact here in Q2 and then improvement in the second half of the year on the margin side.
And obviously, the comparisons get significantly easier in the back half of the year. So last year in the first quarter Welding was down 3%, which sounds like an easy comp, but actually it’s not when you look how the rest of 2015 unfolded. So the comps will get better as we go through this year based on current sequential trends that we look at we’ll see flat to positive in the back half and the margins will improve also in the back half we have another slug of restructuring to get through in the second quarter. And then for now hopefully the worst is behind us.
Joseph Ritchie
Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe
Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on John’s question. Hello can you hear me?
Ernest Scott Santi
Yeah we can hear you.
Nigel Coe
So there is some chatter that the March was a bit weaker than Jan and February for industrial markets. Did you see that, doesn’t sound like you did given your comments?
Ernest Scott Santi
We did not.
Nigel Coe
Okay, good. Moving on to construction and construction was the stand out this quarter with 5% and 11% North America. And I’m wondering is there any way to trying to understand how of this is weather driven, I’m assuming the construction activity did benefit from weather and how much has been pulled forward from maybe 2Q into Q1? And maybe just characterize that by talking about how you exit the quarter on Construction Products was it pretty steady as well?
Ernest Scott Santi
Yeah, to answer to your question is there is really no way to factor weather in in terms of how it might have impacted our results relative to whatever you might call it normalized year. So which is a big reason why we usually don’t bite on any single quarter trends in construction as predictive or indicative of overall demand. I think what I would say is we certainly exited the quarter in pretty good shape there. And so I think we are not seeing anything slow down or ease up and we’ll hope it continues through the balance of the year for sure.
Nigel Coe
Okay, great. And just a quick follow-on on the construction, Europe is flat and we’ve seen some signs of maybe green shoots in construction activity in Europe. But I know that UK is an important end market. So I’m wondering can you maybe just talk about leasing in Europe as the UK starting to slow down for Europe and I see in some green shoots in Continental Europe?
Ernest Scott Santi
No, we are not seeing anything slowdown. We are a bit of lager in terms of when our products are actually going on to the job it’s well after the start phase. So I think in terms of color the overall sort of macro view over there from the standpoint construction is things are heading in the right direction.
Nigel Coe
Great, thanks a lot guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Ernest Scott Santi
Thank you.
Michael Larsen
Good morning.
Andrew Kaplowitz
You’re more than - you are four years into Enterprise Strategy and Q1 ‘16 appears to be your best quarter really in the last four years in terms of margin contribution from the Enterprise Strategy. So what surprising is that we would think that given tougher comparisons and given you are now obviously more than half way done with your initiatives, you are hitting this kind of performance. Can you give us a little more color as to what’s going on? Is it just that your team is now better at implementing your initiatives are they nearly in the program or is that you are tackling more complicated areas of your business such as European Construction or Specific Products that you actually find it easier to improve efficiency?

Ernest Scott Santi
Well, what I would probably say is that we are these were not a series of initiatives that we are all implemented simultaneously. So we are basically sequencing through. If you look at the progression that we laid out and we talked about this as early on that we were heavily focused on the portfolio, business structure simplification, sourcing we said all long had a ramp, if you remember that it was now famously known as the heat map from our first presentation.
And then we had an initiative that was related to what we call business model excellence, which we’re applying the ITW business model to be scaled up much more focused businesses and so what we are seeing today is much more now of an impact from sourcing the layer stage stuff. So it wasn’t necessarily in all at once sort of level of execution across all those initiatives they were very intentionally laid out in the sequence because we had to get certain things done that will allow us to get to the next phase things.
So some of the improvement that we are seeing and is just now sourcing and business model excellence starting to take over from BSS and the portfolio work that we did. And the other thing that I would say is you are starting to see some impact from incremental contribution from organic growth as we starting to make the pivot to growth. And Michael showed you a chart earlier, but if you look at that where we had the best margin performance in the quarter was in this the parts of the company that were generating most organic growth. So the elevated level of profitability and the incremental profit we generate and every dollar of organic is now starting to contribute as we move into this next phase of our strategy.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Got it, Scott. So let me ask you about the pivot to growth that you’ve talked before about 85% of your businesses is being ready to grow by the end of ‘16 from 60% I guess in the last year. So how many more businesses or even should we be thinking like this that you convert in 1Q as ready to grow. And when you do convert these are you seeing the growth progression of businesses that you expect. And you still have percentage point headwind on growth from PLS in the quarter I think you’ve thought about 90 bps for the year. How does that progression work out, does it start falling does the headwind start falling significantly just at the very end of the year or does it start falling now?
Ernest Scott Santi
Well to start with the last part first. The portfolio work that we’re doing at the product line level at some point is going to dissipate. I think we are - frankly we’re there is still a fair amount of that to do heading into ‘16. We won’t know what that looks like for ‘17 fully until we get into the planning cycle, but I would say we’re certainly moving in the direction of getting to the tailwind of that. And it will not be some ongoing maintenance that we do, but it will not be something we’ll talk about anymore. Won’t have a significant impact at some point.
But it is a process that takes some time to work through. We have to move customers from product A to product B it’s not something that we can just - we just start selling something. So it does take some work and there is a process attached to it. But I would expect that number in ‘17 will be lower than it was in ‘16. And certainly by the end of the ‘17 it should be a non-factor.
On the first part of your question we are sort of executing the plan that we laid out. We are - I can’t give you a number for how many crossed the transition line from preparing to grow to ready to grow in the first quarter, but we’ve got a lot of planning around hitting that 85% level by year end. And at that point those businesses start to change their focus to grow as I would certainly note that it’s not necessarily something where we look for an immediate ramp. But ultimately what it means is there is significant part of their organizational energy and effort 75% plus start to go into focusing on fully leveraging their organic growth potential.

And from that we certainly expect a change in growth rate velocity inside those businesses. And we’ve already shown that in places like Food Equipment and Automotive that have been that furthest ones down the path.
Andrew Kaplowitz
Thanks, Scott.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
David Raso
Thank you. I know you maintained your organic sales growth guidance in total as well as total company sales, but maybe I missed it but did you change your outlook at all within the business segments? Any particular end markets be it global auto builds, construction starts I mean any color you can give us on changes within that keeping the total?
Michael Larsen
No David, we didn’t change anything by segment. So when we look at our internal planning like we said Automotive and as well as the other segments we’re right on track in Q1. And so we haven’t changed anything in terms of our outlook for the year by segments.
David Raso
And then given the auto acquisition is still hopefully you are going to be closed to relatively soon. But the M&A front, obviously was not bigger deal. I assume you’re still out looking at other things. Can you give us an update on how we should think about M&A as we move further into the year into next year?
Michael Larsen
Yeah we are still focused on working the plan which is not - M&A is not a big priority. We have what we think is a terrific opportunity that we brought in, in this auto business. And we’re focused on getting that one closed. There is and we’ve talked about where these - where acquisitions fitting our strategy. This is we’re going to - we'll look at things that we think can further support to reinforce the organic growth strategies of our seven segments. And there is probably two or three little bolt-on floating around at any given time. But not a big priority, our big priority is continuing to move down the path of executing these initiatives internally. Getting ourselves very focused then on fully leveraging the organic growth potential for other reasons I talked about earlier. With the incremental profitability from every dollar of organic revenue growth is by far the most accretive thing we can do.
David Raso
Okay. And lastly I apologize if I missed it, but the share repo for the quarter what was...
Michael Larsen
$500 million in line with the planning that we lead out. So think of the $2 billion as $500 million for a quarter is the way we’ve planned it out.
David Raso
That’s helpful. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray
I was hoping you’d give us update on price cost in the quarter and then the outlook given some of the changes for some of the raws like steel for the balance of the year?
Michael Larsen
Yeah Deane so price cost like I said was 20 basis points for the quarter right in line with our planning assumptions, right in line with what we saw last year and that remains our assumption for the rest of the year nothing unusual again this quarter by segment everything is on track. So that’s the color I can give you.
Deane Dray
Got it. And then just to go back on the comment at the beginning regarding the emphasis on GAAP earnings and I think I certainly applaud that I know from a quality of earnings standpoint that gets recognized. And so I was interested in hearing that you’re doing somewhat we would call quite restructuring in Welding and you’ve sized that for us what’s the payback that you’re expecting on that and is there any other quite restructuring going on elsewhere in the segments?
Michael Larsen
The payback is on this project is typically less than the year this one is actually quite a bit better than that it’s primarily focused on North America. And we do disclose the last page in the press release lays out restructuring by segment and you can see the most significant one is Welding this quarter like I said there’ll be another series of restructuring here in Welding in Q2 and that we’ll kind of update you as we go through the year.

Deane Dray
And how much of that is cash?
Michael Larsen
So it’s actually all cash, but not significant I mean you look at how much cash we generate this does not don’t think if it is having an impact on our capital allocation strategy.
Deane Dray
Understood, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is now open.
Mig Dobre
Great, thank you. Good morning. Maybe a clarification for me if you would, looking at slide number five where you’re talking about your consumer and industrial businesses on a sequential basis so my understanding is that the sequential number that you’re providing are adjusted for seasonality for the footnote on the page. I’m looking at industrial businesses being down 5%, I think last quarter they were up 4% sequentially. So I’m trying to sort of understand exactly what’s going on in these industrial businesses? And in Welding specifically because that appears to be the driver here. Are things getting incrementally worse in Welding or was this simply that we had some sort of a pull forward of demand last quarter?
Michael Larsen
No I wouldn’t say there was any pull forward in demand I mean the reason for the sequential decline is essentially all Welding. Typically in Q1 versus Q4 like we said we would expect our Welding business to be up 3%, I mean it was actually down 3%. Test & Measurement which is the other segment in here was essentially stable from Q4 to Q1. So it’s all Welding driven mix.
Mig Dobre
Right. And I guess the spirit of my question was there is a sense out there maybe things are stabilizing in some of these end markets that have been really challenged in 2015 and in Welding you’ve got exposure in a lot of them what’s your read through based on the way your business is progressing?
Michael Larsen
I think as Scott said earlier I think other than welding everything is stable and feels pretty firm as we start the year. In Welding we continue to see the impact on energy oil and gas which accounts for the decline on the international side, general fabrication is still challenged especially going into mining, agriculture heavy equipment. So the demand environment in terms of capital equipment going into the industrial economy we would describe as still sluggish and as Scott said we’ve not seen any sign yet of improvement at this point.
Mig Dobre
Okay. And then maybe…
Michael Larsen
Go ahead.
Mig Dobre
The last thing is when you’re talking about volumes maybe being stable to slightly up in Welding in the back half I’m trying to understand how you think about this business sequentially, seasonally?
Michael Larsen
Yeah Mig that’s purely a comparison current run rate. So at current run rates if you run those out and you look at on a year-over-year basis that’s when you get 9% decline organic in Q1. You’ll get us another decline in Q2 and then stable to up in the second half, flat to up in the back half of the year at current run-rate. That can obviously change, but at current run rates given the comparisons year-over-year that’s what we would expect to see.
Mig Dobre
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is now open.
Joel Tiss
Alright, thank you very much. I just wondered if we can dig a little bit more into the food business. And can you give us any color on the different end markets and what some of the drivers in the improvement were and what the outlook is going to the next couple of quarters?
Ernest Scott Santi
Yeah so Joe we feel very good about the first quarter, particularly if you look at North America up 5% and the equipment side up 4% service. From a product line standpoint, refrigeration and cooking are the big drivers this quarter. And then by end market it’s really healthcare and lodging continue to be solid for us. But really across the board, we feel very good about the outlook for the year. We have a number of new products coming in here in Q2. And so we’d expect that business to be up similar to last year in the 3% to 4% range as we talked about in the last call.

Joel Tiss
Okay. Can we do the same thing for polymers and fluids? There are so many different end markets and different pieces. Can you just give us a little deeper color there too? Thank you.
Ernest Scott Santi
Yeah what I would offer on polymers and fluids is it’s a basically an MRO business. Two thirds of it the third is the automotive aftermarket piece, the automotive aftermarket side of it they had a pretty solid quarter up 2%. I think largely how I would characterize the overall growth performance on the quarter is they’ve gotten to the end of a pretty extensive PLS process and are starting to now - the product line is much more stable than it’s been over the last eight quarters and they’re starting to now turn their attention more to growth. And so very pleased to see positive overall organic out of that segment in the quarter.
Joel Tiss
Alright, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Andy Casey
Thanks, good morning. Kind of a detail question to start the 50 basis point drag in components on margin that you call out on slide seven. Your mentioned the overhead inflation could you provide a little bit more detail on what’s driving that inflation?
Michael Larsen
Salary increases.
Andy Casey
Good for you guys. Then on the follow-up, if we look at some of the macro data the inventory to sales ratios are relatively high in the U.S. in some areas, have you guys seen any change in customer inventory actions meaning destock restock or is it just pretty consistent based on your commentary about overall trends outside of Welding?
Michael Larsen
 I’d say very consistent. And you’re seeing little bit of seasonality in Q1, but if you look at the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year, really solid working capital performance and nothing unusual. And just look at the free cash flow number 90% the average is about last few years has been 65%. So really strong cash flow performance again in the first quarter and keep in mind that we typically ramp up from here. So from a conversion standpoint this is typically our lowest quarter and then we will go up sequentially as we go through the year just typical seasonality. So nothing unusual in terms of working capital, continued strong performance.
Andy Casey
Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Steve Volkmann
Hi, good morning. Scott I think you mentioned that the best return that you could come up with I am paraphrasing here was basically incremental margin on organic growth. And I’m wondering if you’ve changed the way that you’re thinking about that and it seems like in 2017 maybe we’ll get a little less PLS headwind. And maybe we get a little organic growth if we were to have a couple of points of organic growth in ‘17, my number is not yours, but what - how do you think about incrementals against that backdrop?
Ernest Scott Santi
Well. What I said was that the incremental profit from every dollar of incremental - dollar of organic revenue was the highest value opportunity that we had and really what we were focused on leveraging towards full potential not the percentage. And we’ve talked about incremental margin, so our target is roughly 35% going forward in terms of conversion to the bottom line from every incremental dollar of organic growth, that will vary up or down a little bit depending on the segment and if anything I would expect we would comfortably do that or be even a little bit better given the elevated levels of profitability that we’re now operating at.
Steve Volkmann
Okay, great. That’s exactly what I was looking for. And then just on Test & Measurement and Electronics, the absolute levels margin there is still not quite in line with some of your others and I know there is a fair amount of acquisition related intangibles et cetera, but is that kind of an okay level in your mind for that business, is that just kind of what that business can do or is there some sort of bigger picture thing that you can do to get that sort of more into the mid-20s?

Michael Larsen
So what I would say is 15.5% operating margin includes as you point out the 420 basis points of non-cash amortization expense, so you add that back, it’s about 20 it’s still on the lower end inside of ITW, we expect all of our businesses continue to improve margins some will as you saw more than others and I would probably put Test & Measurement in that category of more margin potential than some of the other segments. So we expect that segment to continue to improve on the margin side including in 2016 as…
Ernest Scott Santi
These amortization charges also bleed off over time.
Michael Larsen
Amortization charges, as well as the Enterprise Initiatives, exactly.
Steve Volkmann
Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Williams from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Sean Williams
Hi, good morning.
Michael Larsen
Good morning.
Sean Williams
Wonder, if we just maybe go back to Food Equipment, certainly the margin improvements within that segment has been tremendous over last several years; I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about kind of where we’d go from here? I mean, obviously the - I’d expect maybe further improvement in the back half of the year just kind of seasonal speaking, but I don’t know can just talk about what are the kind of the big opportunities for Food Equipment given that, you’re already kind of approaching best-in-class margins there?
Ernest Scott Santi
Like I said, I mean, we expect all of our segments to improve including Food Equipment, certainly good progress, but also more to come. And I think, we’ll give you - if you look at the schedule and the back of the press release you can see the various components. And so the margin expansion now is half is operating leverage and the other half approximately is the Enterprise Initiatives and within Food Equipments specifically, yes. So we’d expect that business to continue to improve.
Sean Williams
Alright, that’s helpful. And then, could we just maybe come back and maybe your thoughts on kind of some of the overseas markets. Could you just maybe talk generally kind of industrial versus consumer facing for Asia Pacific I know that that look like sequentially it was down I know that was a tough comp, but just where you’re seeing in Asia Pacific and then any green sheets in Europe as well?
Michael Larsen
So I wouldn’t - we’re not going parse it much more than what we did in the prepared remarks and what you can see on page six. And the outlook for the rest of the year in the Asia Pacific is growth rates very similar to what we saw here in the Q1 certainly encouraged by China Automotive of 6%, as well as continued progress on the - in Construction Products, which as may know is primarily Australia based. So that’s how we would describe that.
Sean Williams
And then any thoughts on Europe?
Michael Larsen
Europe, I think for the year we expect very similar again to Q1. So up in the very low single-digits based on current run rates.
Sean Williams
Alright. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jamie Cook
Hi, good morning. Just two quick clarifications, one, I think within auto you talked about in your prepared remarks being able to grow I think 2 to 4 points better than whatever the market is doing. Just in terms of the clarification does that include the auto acquisition or is that exclusive of the auto acquisition? And then last just another question on the guide, I’m sort of struggling with how you don’t get to the mid or high end given the first quarter, given FX, given commentary industrialist very stable outside of Welding I mean what... I’m just trying to figure out what you did in your repo is what price cost be the biggest risk? I’m just trying to get a sense of what you’re most concerned about? Thanks.

Ernest Scott Santi
On the first question that growth target we talked about is it does not include the acquisition, that’s core organic and that’s our expectation both for ‘16 and our longer term growth target for the auto OEM segment. With respect to the balance of the year Michael talked about it before. The currency is there is no win in trying to forecast where currency goes. So we’ve always sort of use current run rates on currency. We use obviously at the quarterly levels they move around.
So there is - we are not going to forward forecast where currency is going to be, Michael’s comment was that if everything stayed exactly where it was - two comments that I’ll repeat. One is that we are impacted by more than just the euro, Aussie dollar, Canadian dollar, also reasonably material factors, as is the pound. And then the other part of that is if everything stay exactly where it is and I don’t know if you marking the market today Michael but around right now that there is probably a few pennies of upside is on the full year basis. Who knows if that will happen and may go the other…
Jamie Cook
I just wanted to get a sense more on the end market side, because again consumer is pretty good outside of Welding industrial is pretty stable. And I’m just more on an end market or geography where you are most concerned.
Ernest Scott Santi
I think generally speaking we are feeling like the first quarter was pretty solid, pretty firm. We have talked about this before, we are basically taking current run rates and projecting those through the year. And that’s how we derive our growth and earnings forecast for the year. So if things stay where they are today we’re in pretty solid shape.
Jamie Cook
Okay, thanks a lot.
Ernest Scott Santi
Yeah.
Jamie Cook
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Ann Duignan
Hi, good morning. One of my questions has been answered. But maybe taking Jaime’s question and asking it a slightly different way. What would have to happen for you to come in at the low end of your Q2 guidance and then the high end of your Q2 guidance? What are you contemplating in those ranges?
Ernest Scott Santi
The drivers would be of variance from current run rates either better or worse than what we see today. So that would be the primary driver. I think on the things that are within our own control in terms of the so called self-help Enterprise Initiatives, we feel very good about continuing to execute the way we have for the last since we embarked on the enterprise strategy. So I think those are on the margin side very solid.
Michael Larsen
The delta is the demand side.
Ernest Scott Santi
Right.
Ann Duignan
But within which segments, when you are putting your plan together where do you think the down side risk is, where do you think the up side risk is?
Ernest Scott Santi
I think here is what I’d say, I would say one of the real strengths of the company and we talked about this is really well balanced, diversified, high quality portfolio of businesses. And so if certain things are better than run rates in one part of the company it will offset in other pre-existing. And so I wouldn’t - I can’t go down the path by segment how we think about this.
Ann Duignan
Okay. And maybe as a follow-up and within welding it does seem to be the one segment where maybe you are not as upbeat about where things are, can you just talk about - a little bit about the difference we are seeing in oil and gas at this point versus you did talk about fabrication for mining and heavy equipment, have any of those end-markets gotten incrementally worse or is it just they’re bad and they aren’t getting any better?
Ernest Scott Santi
I think like we said earlier I mean Welding did decelerate in Q1 versus Q4. And when you look at the year-over-year decline, the more than half of that organic decline is oil and gas. So that is the main driver and it like we said earlier, we haven’t seen any signs that things are getting better there yet.

Ann Duignan
And on the industrial side?
Ernest Scott Santi
Those are fairly stable. The decline is primarily on the oil and gas side. So…
Ann Duignan
Okay, thank you. I leave it there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is now open.
Steven Fisher
Great, thanks. Good morning. I just want to come back to the price cost that Deane was asking about before, because the cost have risen as the core has gone along. So maybe how are the pricing discussions going at the start of Q2? Are those adjusting kind of in real time to more than offset the higher input cost, how do you keep that price cost stable?
Michael Larsen
Well I mean I am not sure how to answer that, other than what I said earlier in my prepared remarks and the response to Deane’s question. Price cost was favorable 20 points no change. And we expect it to remain at 20 basis points as we go through the year. And if that changes we’ll let you know over the next earnings call. But we don’t expect it to.
Steven Fisher
And so basically it sounds like you’re able to raise prices to offset the costs as it increased.
Michael Larsen
If you look at our historical performance and what I just said, that would be the conclusion, yes.
Steven Fisher
Okay. And then just summarize this, I know it’s been discussed before, but does your base case assume that the industrial facing businesses exist the year neutral or positive or there will it still be declining?
Ernest Scott Santi
Well the base case is take the order rates where you’re getting today on a daily basis and project them through the end of the year. The comps get easier as Michael said, but we are projecting no acceleration or further deceleration from here. And we’ve talked about that before we are a fast reactor we’re not a predictor on the future. So embedded in both our organic numbers and our EPS forecast is an assumption that demand stays exactly where it is today across all seven segments projected out through the rest of the year.
Steven Fisher
So will the comps get you to neutral in industrial facing by exiting the year then?
Ernest Scott Santi
It may be close.
Steven Fisher
Okay, thank you.
Ernest Scott Santi
Great. And that takes us to the top of the hour. We appreciate everybody’s time this morning and have an outstanding day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. This call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President, Investor RelationsGreat. Thanks, Madison. And good morning. Welcome to ITW's second quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me this morning are our CEO, Scott Santi; and our CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and update you on our earnings forecast.Before we get to the results, let me remind you that this presentation contains our financial forecast for the 2015 third quarter and full-year as well as other forward-looking statements identified on the slide. We refer you to the company's 2014 Form 10-K and first quarter 2015 Form 10-Q for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Also, this presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.Ernest Scott Santi - President, Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. In the face of a fairly unprecedented combination of currency translation headwinds and contracting demand in two of the company's highest growth core businesses, ITW delivered another solid quarter of execution with earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 7% over the last year. Excluding the $0.12 negative impact of currency translation, our earnings per share would have been up 17%. Operating margin in the quarter was up 80 basis points year-on-year, and operating margin of 21.3% was a new all-time record for the company. In addition, after-tax return on invested capital reached our Enterprise Strategy target of 20% plus.Despite the current challenges associated with the external environment, we continue to focus on and invest in our strategy to accelerate organic revenue growth across the company. In the first half of 2015, we invested roughly $300 million in our businesses, as we added capital equipment to expand capacity, launched new products, and continued to simplify our businesses in order to focus them on their largest and most compelling growth opportunities. Our pivot and focus to organic growth is already delivering solid above-market growth in our Automotive OEM and Food Equipment segments, and we saw nice improvement in the organic growth rate in our Construction segment this quarter. As a result, we now have three of our seven segments growing organically in the mid-to-upper single-digit range.Revenues in our Welding segment and Test & Measurement platform were down significantly in Q2, Welding down 6% and Test & Measurement down 7%, as both businesses are seeing contracting demand from the oil and gas sector and the continued soft capital spending environment for industrial equipment more generally. Both of these businesses have traditionally been among ITW's fastest and most consistent organic growers, and we believe that the long-term fundamentals for growth and profitability in both of these businesses remain very strong. As a result, we continue to invest to ensure that they are well positioned to return to their historic growth rates as conditions in their end markets improve.As we wrap up the second quarter of 2015, we are also at the halfway point of our five-year Enterprise Strategy. And while we have a lot of work left to do, we've made substantial progress in executing our strategy to position ITW to deliver solid above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns on capital. We've divested over 30 businesses including two full segments in conjunction with our portfolio strategy to focus the company exclusively on businesses that have strong and sustainable differentiation attributes.Our business teams are currently executing the product line level component of this strategy through our product line simplification initiative. As a result, ITW today has a much more differentiated set of businesses with better overall earnings quality and significantly higher organic growth potential. As an aside and as an illustration of the significantly higher overall level of quality of the ITW business portfolio, last year, ITW's operating income of $2.9 billion was an all-time record for the company. The prior record of $2.8 billion was set in 2012 when the company's revenues were $3.4 billion higher. So in other words, last year, we made more money than we ever had in the history of the company and revenues that were $3.4 billion lower than the prior record.Our focus now will increasingly turn to leveraging this much higher quality business portfolio into accelerated organic growth. Activities associated with business structure simplification are starting to lessen with significant incremental benefits still to come. Strategic sourcing is now fully embedded in our operations and delivering consistent above-plan benefits.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

During today's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results, update you on our 2016 earnings forecast and discuss the acquisition that we announced on Monday.

Thanks, Aaron, and good morning. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year as we continued to execute on our Enterprise Strategy and deliver strong results in a challenging but stable environment. In 2015, ITW grew earnings per share 10%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points to a record of 21.4% and improved after-tax return on invested capital by 140 basis points to a record 20.4%. Free cash flow was strong in 2015 at a 106% of net income, and we invested roughly $560 million in our businesses for growth and productivity.
In addition, we returned more than $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
In 2015, we continued to make significant progress on the execution of our Enterprise Strategy as evidenced by more than 100 basis points of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives. As a reminder, we expect an additional incremental 100 basis points of margin expansion from our Business Structure Simplification, Sourcing, and 80/20 Excellence initiatives in each of 2016 and 2017.
In 2015, we also began our pivot to focus on our organic growth agenda, and we made meaningful progress with 60% of the company's revenues achieving ready-to-grow status and 45% growing at 6% in 2015. We continue to execute the various elements of our Enterprise Strategy in a well-planned and logical sequence as we position ITW to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns, and we remain firmly on track to deliver on our end of 2017 enterprise performance goals.

I'd like to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for the great job that they continue to do in serving our customers and in executing our strategy.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael, and then, I'll be back to discuss the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. Michael?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everybody.
As you saw this morning, ITW delivered another strong quarter. EPS of $1.23 increased 4% versus prior year, 11% excluding currency. Our results were driven by strong execution across the board as operating margin improved 110 basis points to 20.7% and our self-help enterprise initiatives contributed 110 basis points of improvement.
Organic revenue was modestly better than our guidance with some credit challenging comparisons in a few segments. While demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, underlying demand trends were stable across our business portfolio. Adjusted for seasonality, demand in our industrial businesses improved 4% sequentially in Q4 versus Q3. Free cash flow was very strong at 140% of net income, and, as you can see, we made meaningful progress on our return on invested capital metrics. In summary, stable demand across our business portfolio and solid execution drove strong Q4 performance.
Turning to revenue by geography on page five, let me just remind you that the organic revenue number includes a one percentage point impact from Product Line Simplification as organic revenue declined 0.6% with some fairly challenging comparisons in the prior year. By geography, North America was down 1.6% with our consumer facing businesses up 2% and the industrial businesses down 5.6%. International was positive, up 0.6% with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 1.9%.
Our consumer businesses grew 4.6% with strength in Automotive OEM up 10% in Europe and Food Equipment. Asia Pacific and China were essentially flat, and it's worth pointing out that China automotive was up 14% in the fourth quarter. So overall, stable end-market conditions across the portfolio and slightly better-than-expected organic revenue performance in the quarter against a fairly challenging comparison.
On page six, strong operating margin performance once again in the quarter. Operating margin of 20.7%, improved 110 basis points, and four segments improved between 220 basis points and 420 basis points, driven primarily by our self-help enterprise initiatives and lower restructuring. Pricing was solid in the quarter. Price/cost was favorable, 30 basis points. So strong progress on operating margin, and as Scott said, we're on track to realize additional incremental margin improvement as we go forward.
On page seven, we listed full-year 2015 operating margin by segment, and you can see the strong progress since the launch of the Enterprise Strategy.
Turning to the segments, starting with Automotive OEM, another strong quarter. Organic revenue up 5% and up 6% for the year, outpacing worldwide builds of 1%. Europe was up 10% organically in the quarter and up 11% for the year. North America was up 4% and China was up 14% in the quarter and up 8% for the year. Consistent with global industry growth rates, our 2016 guidance assumes a 1% increase in global auto builds versus 2015.
Solid quarter in Test & Measurement/Electronics as margin improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 18.1%. Demand trends in this segment improved in the quarter. Sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, revenues were up 6%, up 2% adjusted for typical seasonality. Also another solid quarter in Food Equipment, up 2% organically, facing some challenging comparisons from last year. You may recall that Equipment was up 6% worldwide in Q4 last year.

Operating margin improved 220 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 23.9%. North America service was up 4% and underlying equipment demand remained solid, particularly in bakery, healthcare and lodging. International equipment was up 4% on continued strong demand in warewash, cooking, and refrigeration.
Polymers & Fluids was down 3% due to soft demand related to industrial MRO, with North America down 4%, partially offset by Asia Pacific up 9%. Operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 18.2%.
Welding was down 11% organically in a tough environment and against some challenging comparisons. You may recall that in the fourth quarter last year North America was up 10% and oil and gas was up 20%. The 11% year-over-year decline breaks down as 6 points from oil and gas, 3 points from industrial and 2 points from commercial. North America overall was down 8%, with consumables essentially flat. International, as you can see, was down 20% due to oil and gas, primarily in onshore pipeline and offshore.
But as we've talked about on the last earnings calls, the year-over-year numbers can be somewhat misleading in terms of understanding the underlying trends. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the underlying demand trends have actually been fairly stable since the first quarter of 2015. On a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, we saw a significant step-down in demand in Q1 last year followed by slight declines in Q2 and Q3, and then, in this fourth quarter, demand actually improved 2% sequentially from Q3. Consistent with current demand levels, our 2016 guidance assumes a single-digit decline in the Welding segment.
On slide 10, Construction Products had another strong quarter on the top line and bottom line. Organic revenue was up 3% and margin was up 420 basis points. North America was up 2% with high-single-digit growth in the renovation and remodel channel. Residential was essentially flat, and commercial was down slightly. Asia Pacific was strong, up 7% due to Australia.
In Specialty Products, organic revenue was flat, with solid growth in consumer packaging, offset by the impact of Product Line Simplification. Operating margin improved by 400 basis points, 23%.
Turning to slide 11, as you know, one of the core strengths of ITW is our diversified portfolio, and in the current environment, the fact that about 60% of our revenues are consumer facing. As you can see, in a tough environment, our consumer businesses, Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, portions of Specialty Products and Construction, are growing at an organic rate of 3% in the fourth quarter and for the full-year, and the seasonally adjusted sequential trends are stable.
Our industrial businesses, Welding, Test & Measurement and Electronics, were down 6% in the quarter, and down 5% for the year. However, if you look at the seasonally adjusted sequential trend from Q3 to Q4 revenues are up 4%. In simple terms, based on typical seasonality, you would expect these businesses to be down 2% sequentially, but they were actually up 2%. It may be too early to call this a trend, but certainly, an encouraging data point as we look ahead.
Quickly on 2015, you can see that we continue to make significant progress on all of our financial performance metrics. EPS growth, operating margin improvement, return on capital, and free cash flow all reflect the strength of ITW's differentiated business model and our strong execution in a tough environment.
Going back a little bit further to the launch of the Enterprise Strategy on slide 13, the same holds true. More than 500 basis points improvement in margin and returns, 17% EPS CAGR, and solid progress in our pivot to growth. As Scott said, 60% of the company's revenues achieved ready-to-grow status, and 45% grew at 6% in 2015. We fully expect that 85% of the company's revenues will be in ready-to-grow status by the end of 2016. In summary, over the last three years, really good progress, and we've done everything we said we would do. And we're on track to achieve our 2017 performance goals.

On slide 14, we are reaffirming the guidance as discussed in New York on December 4. Our organic revenue growth expectation of 1% to 3% is in line with Q4 demand levels, and includes 90 basis points of Product Line Simplification impact (12:55). In 2016, we expect 100 basis points or more of margin improvement from our self-help enterprise initiatives, independent of volume, and operating margin is projected to be a new record of approximately 22.5%, earnings per share in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, and 6% growth at the midpoint, and 10% growth excluding currency.
Turning to the first quarter, our EPS guidance is $1.20 to $1.30, and the midpoint of $1.25 represents 23% of our full-year earnings right in line with historical patterns. Again, we expect 100 basis points from our self-help enterprise initiatives, and based on current levels of demand, we expect organic revenue growth to be flat to up 2%.
Finally, a quick update on capital allocation, given the two recent developments, and then, I'll hand it over to Scott. Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW for $450 million. From a capital allocation standpoint, approximately, 70% of the purchase price will be funded with non-U.S. cash. And we expect the acquisition to generate returns on capital in the 16% to 20% range by year seven.
In addition, we see significant potential to improve the performance of the EF&C business through the application of ITW's 80/20 business management system, and we expect margins to improve from approximately 10% to 20% by year five. The acquisition is slightly accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, and based on the expected closing date, we expect very little EPS impact in 2016, with accelerating benefits into 2017 and beyond. Finally, we're maintaining our end of 2017 performance goals.
Second, based on our ability to tax-efficiently accessed $1.2 billion of non-U.S. cash this month, we're increasing our share repurchase expectation by $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. The associated EPS benefit for 2016 is largely offset by recent currency moves, but this additional $1 billion of share repurchase also positions us very well for earnings growth in 2017 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it Scott.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Michael and just now a couple of words on the acquisition that we announced earlier this week. On slide 17, let me start in terms of foundation and just talk about the business that we are holding on this acquisition to our Automotive OEM segment. As many of you know, we have a very focused niche strategy in this space. We are essentially a high velocity serial problem solver for OEM and tier suppliers.
The segment, in 2015, had $2.5 billion of revenue and an 8% organic growth CAGR since 2012. As we have talked on a number of occasions, we see very attractive long-term growth opportunities in this space within ITW's very focused niche positioning, and have demonstrated some real ability to execute on that strategy over the last four years or five years as we've talked about on a number of occasions. And we've outgrown global auto builds by over 400 basis points on average since 2012.
So the addition of the ZF – the Engineered Fasteners & Components business from ZF TRW essentially gives us some additional leverage on that strategy, broadens our market positions on slide 18. A very complementary business in terms of strategy and focus, this business is a leading global supplier of engineered fastening systems and technical components largely focused on the interior of the car.
Business is headquartered in Germany, 13 manufacturing facilities and 3,500 employees globally. Very strong solid business, excellent customer relationships, very capable operating team, and a very strong proven track record around quality and delivery execution throughout their history.

On slide 18 (sic) [19], in terms of what does this business do in terms of adding to our current position, a couple of key points in that regard. First of all, it adds several new strategic product platforms that have similar characteristics through the core product platforms that we support today, certainly have very demonstrated track record in terms of innovation. The business is bringing with it over 500 active patents.
And from the standpoint of the manufacturing customer support footprint, very tilted towards Asia, so it supplements our position in Asia. The overall business is, standpoint of revenue by geography, is 45% Europe, 20% North America, 35% in Asia Pacific, so very complementary to our geographic footprint, which is a little more weighted towards North America. So it gives us better global balance overall.
And certainly, the last point is we see significant potential to leverage our 80/20 business management process in terms of helping the EF&C business continue to improve its operating metrics. Operating margins on the way in (18:52) are about 10%, and as Michael talked about, we think we have line of sight on at least doubling that rate over the first five years of ownership.
From the standpoint of the transaction components, purchase price is roughly one times sales. Michael talked about the near-term accretion, certainly, modestly positive in the first 12 months, including all non-cash acquisition accounting related costs, certainly, expect to generate returns on capital well within our target, over the first seven years to 10 years of the acquisition. Michael talked about our ability to fund 70% or so of the purchase price with non-U.S. cash, which is an acquisition from a strategic and operational and return standpoint that we would have done regardless of funding sources, but certainly, the ability to use a significant portion of the purchase cost, the ability to use cash overseas is certainly an added benefit here, but didn't drive the deal. And we expect to close in the second half of – or this first half of 2016.
So with that, I think we're – that's all for our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Are we going to proceed with the question-and-answer session?
Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President-Investor Relations
Yes, let's begin the question and answer, thank you.
Operator
You're welcome. One moment. Our first question will be coming from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And nice quarter. Maybe starting on the 2016 guide, you maintain the guide, and it seems like you've built some margin of error in the guide also with this $1 billion repatriation. And so, maybe talk a little bit about your opportunity to still hit at least the midpoint, maybe even the higher end of the guide, if in fact organic growth were to disappoint as we kind of progress through the year.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, Joe, I'd say on the organic, 1% to 3% guide for 2016 is based on the demand levels we're seeing in the businesses today, as per usual. So we're not counting on improvement in underlying demand or in market conditions. Based on current run rates, we are solidly in that range of 1% to 3%.
I think in terms of margin of error, what I would say is that we still have a lot of things that are within our control, in terms of our self-help. And number one on the list are the enterprise initiatives that we've continued to execute well on over the last two years. And we expect another 100 basis points of margin expansion, independent of volume from those in 2016. If you translate that into EPS, as we said in December, that's about $0.30 of EPS growth.

Certainly, in addition to that, the $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program gives us some additional EPS benefit. Unfortunately, some of that is, depending on the timing, is offset by recent currency moves. Not so much in the euro, but primarily in Canadian and Australian dollars, the pound, but it does give us a little bit of room here.
So overall, in terms of the guidance, we feel very good about maintaining where we're at in the $5.35 to $5.55 range, and we feel really good about continuing to make solid progress on organic growth. You saw some of that in the fourth quarter. And just based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, we'd expect that to continue in 2016.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That's helpful color, Michael. Maybe as my follow-on question, there's a lot of concern in the market regarding what's happening in the auto end market. Clearly, that's an end market that has been incredibly good for you guys. You continue to outpace global auto builds, but it looks like this past quarter, we saw a little bit less outgrowth in Auto OEM. So maybe some color on your ability to continue to sustain outgrowth in that end market and how you think about that end market over the next 12 months.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, sure, Joe, this is Scott. I think the story for us remains one of penetration. Michael made a comment in his prepared remarks that our planning scenario, essentially, is for 1% increase in global auto builds next year. I think most of the sort of external forecasters and pundits are in the 2.5% to 3% range.
So in our own planning assumptions, I think we're taking a much more conservative approach as a baseline. It is also, as we talked about before, the one area of our business where we have a significant amount of forward visibility vis-à-vis. We've sold programs into production plans going on this year. Those programs were sold two years and three years ago.
So I think we've got a pretty stable outlook on, in terms of what our expectations are for 2016, with respect to auto built into our plans. It doesn't mean that builds, if we see some inflection in – or some change in overall builds relative to our 1%, that's not going to have an impact, but ultimately, I think the potential impacts are pretty modest. I think we've got our plan set where there's an appropriate level of conservatism, and have enough new penetration and new content in 2016 coming online that we ought to be able to be all right regardless of – pending any sort of major crash, which I don't think anybody thinks is going to happen. I think we're in pretty good position in 2016.
Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay, great. Thanks, Scott. I'll get back in queue.
Operator
All right. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Scott, so can you talk a little bit more about the pivot to growth? How much more challenging do you think it could be to get your businesses that are preparing to grow, to get ready to grow, by the end of 2016, as you talked about in the Analyst Day, if the global economy is a bit weaker?
And maybe you can talk about what these businesses are. If I look at it, it seems like it'd be businesses like European construction, parts of polymers and fluids, parts of specialty products. But that's what I think. What do you think?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think you've hit – in terms of those three areas of the company, I think you've hit three that are still in the preparing to grow mode. The agenda is pretty much within our own control from the standpoint of what we have characterized as moving from preparing to grow to ready to grow. It's largely a lot of 80/20 work, a lot of product line pruning, a lot of customer focus, and a lot of – as we talked in December, a lot on really lasering in on where are the best opportunities to grow.

So I don't think there's much impact on the preparation part from the standpoint of the external environment. That agenda is pretty well mapped out. The timing is, in terms of the sequencing of various parts of the company, from that prepared to grow to ready to grow, just a function of how big the agenda was to get from A to B. And in some cases, we had further to go than others. So the 60% we've gotten in that mode to this point had a slightly less deep agenda. And we're working our way through the rest.
So I don't think there's much impact in terms of the external environment, in terms of the objective that we have laid out to get 85% of our businesses in that mode by the end of this year. That being said, certainly, the external environment, from the standpoint of yield on that investment, is certainly going to have an impact in the short run. A little bit of tailwind, at some point here, would certainly help us showcase the progress we're making, but I think I'd also make the other point that the fact that we're able to grow 45% of our sales in this environment at a 6% clip in 2015 is a pretty good indicator of at least some progress in that regard.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks for that, Scott. And Scott or Michael, can I ask you about price/cost? You had a minor improvement in price/cost from 20 basis points to 30 basis points. But as you know, raw material costs do seem to be coming down, maybe a little more significantly now. So can you actually improve that price/cost from 30 basis points that you had in 1Q or at least maintain it for the year?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, so I think obviously, Andrew, it's not the main driver of our margin performance here. That's really enterprise initiatives. But we were pleased to see 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. That was our best result in 2015. And the average for the year is 20 basis points. And that's what we modeled for 2016.
I think we were all encouraged to see solid price across the portfolio, again, a lot of it driven by the launch of new products, as we've talked about before. And we're starting to see the deflation come through on some of the key raw materials that we're buying. In some cases, we pass those on to customers; we're contractually obligated, so obviously, we'll do that. But there is a little bit more of sort of an improvement in the overall equation here in the fourth quarter. Hopeful that we can maintain that. We're certainly working very hard on that. And we're counting on 20 basis points in the guide for 2016.
Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, Michael. Take care, guys.
Operator
Okay, thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, thanks very much. Okay, so I want to – good morning, everyone. I want to pick up on this auto thematic. I mean, let's be blunt. It was very clear your stock was shorted earlier this year, because of this perceived exposure, your Auto business is going to fall off a cliff. And I understand your confidence based on your track record and your ability to continue to penetrate it. My question is, do you see anything, Scott or Michael, based on your operations that give you a little more comfort than simply the trend? In other words, do you have – and I realize you've got a little bit of a backlog, look forward, but are there initiatives that you're working on that may be derivative of, say, CAFE standards or vehicle electrification, or you're working on a big something in Indonesia or something like that that you think maybe give you – maybe not dramatically, but like a point or two of step-up help over the coming cycle?

Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I wouldn't put Indonesia on the high priority list.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I just meant – that was the only thing that came to mind, but you know.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
But other than that, I think we have – I think I get it, your question. If I don't answer it, let me know. But what I would say is we have a very full pipeline over of engineering and product development activity related to Automotive that's certainly driven by some of the things you talked about, and just other changes in the need profile of our OEM customers in terms of new features, new technologies, new things that they're looking to add.
So I think we have a very solid view of the next 10 years in the space, in terms of what the opportunities are for our particular niche in the space. And I think that's – this is not – we don't manage any of our businesses for the next two quarters, we manage them for the long haul. I think this is an area where we remain, as we've talked before, very optimistic about our ability to continue to increase our content per vehicle, focusing on a very narrowly defined strategy in terms of what we do.
And so, all I can tell you is that the pipeline, in terms of the amount of activity in terms of projects we're working on that are going to come to fruition two years and three years and four years out remains very healthy. We track it, we monitor it, so I think we are on top of sort of what the future might hold in terms of opportunity for us here.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And John, maybe I'll just add that, for those that are maybe a little more short-term focused, we have not seen any signs of a slowdown in the fourth quarter or year-to-date in the automotive space, or across our business portfolio.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Let me just ask kind of a follow-up. This German company you've bought, right, it's going to give you a leg up into Asia. And obviously, ITW, as you're pivoting with cost and simplification, you're going to be doing more M&A. Is there runway to do other kinds of deals like this, perhaps to extend what clearly is then a successful M&A – or excuse me, penetration track record in auto into other markets like, I don't know, for example, Japan or something.
I mean just I realize you can't talk specifically, but maybe the question was more the deal that you did, was it more one-off? Or do you think that there are other things? And just as a follow-up, I mean having a little bit of experience with German companies, I'm assuming that company has a lot of potential productivity or cost efficiency opportunities. Can you still grow it at that cadence and expand the margins?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Trying to think about where to start with that one?
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Sorry. Multi-part second part.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, so I think our overall story in Automotive is largely an organic one. I think this particular business, from the standpoint of complementary fit with our strategy, is a unique opportunity. I would certainly not rule out other opportunities like this. But I think it's not a matter of – it's not the scale we're after here. It's really about sort of auto opportunities where we can extend our access to the key OEMs and extend our ability to play across a range of different product platforms that we think fit the overall screen in terms of high value-added content.
So we talked about the organic growth rate in Auto OEM. I think that's largely that remains the thrust here. So that's the overall focus, and the story is we have significant opportunity to continue to grow and add content per vehicle and do it in a way that's certainly consistent with our overall enterprise performance goals.

That being said, would we look at something that gave us a similar opportunity to extend our reach in some other geography? Sure.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Or technology, perhaps? I mean, I won't – Mobileye comes to mind only because it's been so topical. I'm not talking about that company specifically, but maybe break-through technology. Is that a possibility?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm not sure I heard who the company was. I wouldn't comment on it. I don't think it's – I think we'll assess each opportunity on its own. I don't want to overplay this. I think our primary thrust is – and focus continues to be on leveraging and executing the strategy that we have. So we don't need any more M&A to continue to generate really strong organic growth at really nice incremental yield. So I would say, our thrust here would be more opportunistic than any view that we have to do anything more here. So if opportunities present themselves that we think that will certainly do it, but we have no particular view of we're deficient, we need this, or we have to have that in order to be very successful here over the long haul.
John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
No, I got it. And Mobileye was the company I called out. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good morning, guys.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I'm new to your story, so I'm allowed to ask dumb questions for a couple of quarters. I hope you guys forgive me.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
But can you give us a sense – you seem to have a fair amount of confidence in the 0% to 2% 1Q guide. I mean, January is a fairly important month in the quarter. We're already on this 27th. Are you tracking in that range in January and that gives you the confidence?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, Scott, we're on track in January for the guidance that we gave for the first quarter.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, second question, just following up a little on what John was saying. I mean, this TRW deal looks like just a fantastic deal. I mean, if there's other stuff out there like this, would you be willing to – I mean, would it make sense, at least, to think about not doing the share repurchase and adding the higher return profile instead?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I think, Scott, we really – absolutely, we will continue to look at acquisitions, where we can – that meet the criteria that we talked about in December. So really, the primary purpose here is to support or accelerate our organic growth rate and we're looking for businesses, where we can have significant impact from an 80/20 standpoint. And so to the extent that we see those, we'll certainly continue to work on that.
In terms of overall capital allocation, nothing has changed in terms of our structure and strategy. As you know, we have a strong balance sheet, we have strong liquidity. We generate a lot of cash flow. You saw 140% in the quarter, 106% for the year. And so we have a lot of options. And so for us, it's not a question of either/or, we can do all of the above. And what we've said is to the extent that we don't identify acquisitions that meet the criteria that I just described, then we make a choice to return that cash to our shareholders through an active share repurchase program. And as you saw, we just raised that today from a $1 billion to $2 billion for 2016. So that's how we think about it.

Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That seems to make sense. And then, just a quick one. How much of the 150-basis-point margin of the year you think was price/cost related or LIFO accounting related, or something related to that?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So price/cost was 20 basis points and the primary driver was 110 basis points from the enterprise initiatives.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. All right, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay. Thank you.
Operator; Thank you. And our next question will be coming from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. I just want to circle back to the ZF deal. Scott, it's pretty clear this is a natural fit for you guys, but I didn't hear any specifics regarding what the products are. There's a vague description of strategic product platforms, but if you can get down to the level of the 80/20, the 20% that really matter compared to like lift-to-sits, handles, fuel caps, what is it adding to the portfolio and are there any redundancies?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, this is Michael, Deane. So if you think about it, $470 million in revenues, half of that is what we would describe as fastening systems. And that, not to get too technical here, certainly, I'm not the right person for that, but they're described broadly as fasteners for trim, pipe and hose, hole plugs and wire harnesses. The other half is what is described as technical components. So this is, again, in the interior of the vehicle – air registers, interior ventilation systems, lighting and other interior products. So there's a really nice fit with what we know really well and do very well inside of our current Automotive business.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just in the description, Michael, there are overlaps, the way it sounds, in terms of the fasteners and even some of the air handling. Do you have a sense of how much specific overlap there is?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I think overlap is not a good characterization. Every one of these products is custom-designed around a particular model. So we're sort of describing them in broad category, so they're areas that we know. We know fastening very well in Automotive, but there are hundreds of fastening applications on every car. So every product line here is a specifically designed and engineered solution to a specific problem on a specific model for a specific OEM. So these are sort of areas that we're very familiar with in broad terms, but from the standpoint of are there any exact like-like products? Minimal to none.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's great to hear. And that's a good perspective. And then, just my follow-up question would be for Michael. On the repatriated cash, what's the effective tax rate that you paid on bringing this cash back? And maybe are you netting it against any tax losses? But just when you say it's tax-efficient, what did you have to pay?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So we paid very little. And you saw that in our tax rate last year. We had a similar transaction in the quarter last year. Our rate for the last year was 30.2% for the year, in that 30% to 31% range. And for 2016, we expect to be in that same range, 30% to 31%, including in the first quarter. So, like we said, this was done in a very tax-efficient, very simple transaction. It makes a lot of sense operationally and a really good outcome for the company.

Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And, Michael, I'm sorry to try to pin you down on this. When you say very little, what tax rate – effective tax rate are you paying to bring this cash back?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Essentially zero.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Terrific. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Mig Dobre of Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, my question relates to slide 11 in the deck, looking at industrial and consumer sequentially. So for your industrial businesses, you're up 4% adjusted for seasonality. Maybe kind of nitpicking a little bit, if Welding was flat and Test & Measurement were up 2%, can you give us a sense for what else sort of grew to get you to the plus 4%?
And then, related to this, I'm trying to understand if this is just something that's specific to the company, either through new product introduction or your exposure? Or are you trying to signal that there's something bigger going on in the environment? It's a little different than what we're hearing from other industrial companies in terms of what happens...
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Mig, all we're saying is that, as we talked about on the last earnings call is that what we have seen in our businesses on the industrial side is that trends stabilize, really starting in the second quarter last year. And so if you just take Welding to maybe illustrate this, so if you look at the sequential demand trends in Welding, what we saw in the first quarter was a 8% decline in the demand rate, into the second quarter, into the third quarter, we saw 1%, all seasonally adjusted. And then, in the fourth quarter we saw flat. And so that means that we would expect typical seasonality in Welding. We expect that business to be down 2% and the business was flat. So that's certainly an improvement in terms of the underlying demand trends.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And part of what I would add to that is there's a lot of volatility in the comps, given just the volatility in the end-market. So we talked about fourth quarter last year. So what we're trying just communicate is, not any big change in trend as much as when you look at the year-on-year comps quarter-by-quarter, because of the volatility over the last eight quarters to 10 quarters, those aren't necessarily indicative of what's going on currently. And essentially what we're seeing is relatively stable demand on a orders per day basis. So we're not calling it a trend, we're not calling it a pick-up, but what we are saying is things have been relatively stable.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, and, Mig, a point on the consumer side is really that -this is a little bit different, as you were saying, relative to maybe some of our peers, that 60% of our revenues are tied to the consumer. And that in the current environment where there's some pressure on the industrial side, particularly, CapEx into oil and gas, and we have 60% of the company growing at 3% at a very stable rate for the quarter and for the year. So those are the points we're trying to make on slide 11.
Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. I appreciate that. And then, I know you commented on price/cost, but if we can focus on just price specifically in your industrial businesses, are there some parallels that you can draw between the current environment versus maybe prior downturns where things were challenging? How's pricing behaving versus history here?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President

No change here, Mig. I mean, we saw across the portfolio the ability to get price based on offering value-added products and solutions. We saw no change in the quarter. So really nothing different here.
Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
All right. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
Hi, good morning.
Operator
Your line is open.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
So, two questions, one positive, I guess, one negative. But first a clarification. Maybe I missed it.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks for the warning.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
The guidance, does it not include the auto acquisition, just so we're clear?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No, the guidance today does not include the acquisition. But what we did say is that we expect minimal EPS impact in 2016. This is really more of a 2017 and beyond EPS growth story. And so when the transaction closes, which we expect will happen in the first half of the year, we will update revenue margin guidance. We expect some, but very little impact on the EPS side and we'll give you all that once the transaction closes.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
All right. Thank you. On the positive side, the organic growth guidance for the first quarter was stronger than I would have thought. Is it fair to say the tone at the December meeting when you thought about the cadence for 2016 organic to get to the full-year midpoint of up 2%, that the first quarter organic guidance you just gave is maybe a little better than you were thinking a month or two ago?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I'd say not really, David. I mean, I'd say, the fourth quarter here was a little bit better than our guidance at the beginning of the quarter, but that wasn't really a big surprise to us. And, again, what we're doing is we're taking typical seasonality, run rates from Q4 adjusted for seasonality into Q1 and that gets you into that 0% to 2% range, so there's nothing really different about it.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
Okay, I have to admit, I was thinking that it was a very back half loaded guide in the sense of first half organic maybe down a bit, second half would have to be up a lot. But it sounds like now the cadence sounds a little more 1%,1%, 3%,3%, is kind of the generic base case of the cadence to get the full-year 2%?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, yeah, but again, it's much more about the – because of the comparison to the comps, we're taking current daily run rates and applying basically what we're saying in 2016 is – no change in current run rates gets us 1% to 3% for the year.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And so based on that, I mean, the way you're looking at it, David, I mean, this is not a back-end loaded plan in terms of the organic or the EPS guidance.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
Yeah, I mean, I will say I left the meeting thinking it was even more back-half loaded than the setup you're describing today.
On the negative side, obviously, a lot of positive commentary you have on Auto versus the concerns, but still, end of the day, the quarter, the outgrowth wasn't quite as great as we've seen, and the margins still were down, so maybe I missed it in the prepared remarks. But can you help us understand why the margin was down and how do you see Auto margins for 2016 versus 2015? You're saying worldwide builds up 1%. I assume you expect to outgrow, so call it, 2%, 3%, 4% kind of revenue growth for Auto. How do the margins play out in that scenario?

Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So our margins, I mean, it can vary a little bit on a quarterly basis. I would point to 24.2% operating margin in Auto for the year, great progress. That's how I would think about 2016 with some progress on the enterprise initiatives. For the year, 6% organic growth on builds of 1%, 5% in the quarter. There can be some mix issues, like we talked about in the third quarter. And so I wouldn't read too much into, David, the one particular quarter, but really encourage you to look at it kind of on an annual basis. And we'd certainly expect something very similar in 2016. Scott walked through the penetration and the auto build dynamics, but it should be another solid year for the Auto business.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
That's helpful, but just so I make sure I heard you correctly, the 24.2%, and then you made a comment about enterprise initiatives. The 24.2% includes enterprise initiatives, or is that base, and then whatever you can provide (50:22).
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
The 24.2% is the performance for the full-year in 2015.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
Correct.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And like all of our businesses, we would expect some progress on margins in 2016, some more than others.
David Raso - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities
Okay. that's helpful. Helpful. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Joel Tiss. Your line is open.
Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey guys, how's it going?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good.
Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Just quick for Mike, just a clarification. You said the consumer facing businesses are stable. Does that mean that they're up 3%? They're stable at an up 3% run rate for 2016, or they're stable closer to flat for 2016 versus the up 3% in 2015?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No, when we say stable what we mean is the underlying demand trends adjusted for seasonality from Q3 to Q4, we saw stable demand in those businesses. So...
Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
And you said – oh, go ahead, sorry.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Now it doesn't mean that we expect the consumer businesses to be flat in 2016. We're certainly not giving guidance for consumer and industrial for 2016, but if you think about what's in there, so Automotive, we talked about Food Equipment, we talked about parts of Construction and Specialty, we'd certainly expect those businesses to grow again in 2016.
Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay. And then, just a strategic question on the debt. You were saying in December that you were hoping to use the free cash flow to pay down debt. And I see that your cash is coming down a little bit, and your debt's going up. And I just wondered if there's any change in that thinking going into 2016?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I think, Joel, I think you were saying that. I don't think I said that at the December meeting. So we have, like I said earlier, I mean, we have our current debt to EBITDA is in that 2.2/2.3 range, and we expect no changes to that.
Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First question on the acquisition. Could you help us kind of frame the historical growth rate over the last three years? Was it even close to the 8% CAGR achieved by your Auto business? And then, also based on your initial meetings with the organization over there so far, is your impression that they have the embedded skill-set right now to drive both margin improvement, and ultimately, above market growth kind of in line with corporate goals?

Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So the answer to the first question is the growth rate has been solid, but not at the rate that we've been growing over the last four years. We expect to have some – offer some help in that regard. And then, the second question is that we've been very impressed with the management team in the organization and feel like we're getting a really solid quality team, that runs a great business today and through some additional tools that we can provide around our operating system, I think, can certainly leverage those tools to their full potential.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks, Scott. And then, last one back on Welding, your comments about that being one of the businesses that stabilized during at least the second half of last year. Did you see any difference in trends through the year between CapEx and consumables? And then, also did you see any change within the second half in some of your bigger customers, maybe machinery OEM behavior versus, if you will, the general distributor base.
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, no, so we didn't really see anything other than what I described earlier, right? And so, on the equipment side, certainly down a little bit more than the consumables that have been fairly stable throughout the year, but no significant changes as we've gone through the year or the fourth quarter.
Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks a lot, Michael.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Morgan Stanley.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, thanks. Good morning.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning. Sorry about the last name, there.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
It's okay. I'm used to it. It's DeBlase. So the first question is on Construction. So the North America Construction Products core growth, I think, it decelerated a bit to 2% this quarter. It was more like 7% in 3Q. I'm just curious on the drivers, is it a comp issue? Are you seeing some slowdown in North America Construction on an underlying basis? And then, I guess, what are your thoughts on the North America non-resi construction side goal into 2016?
Michael M. Larsen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So if you look at the fourth quarter, up 3% organic, like I said, residential was flat, which was slightly better than expected. On the renovation remodel channel, that's really where the growth, up 12% for the full-year, and then, commercial down slightly. Those trends, we've been kind of bumping along those same numbers in 2015. We feel good about 2016 and we would expect that business to grow in 2016 at a rate similar to what we saw in 2015, which was up 4% organically.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then, for my follow-up, just looking at the T&M/Electronics business, it was pretty strong this quarter, stronger than we had expected. And I would say that the margin performance there was a bit of a standout. So is that just enterprise initiatives? Or is there anything else to highlight from a margin perspective? And do you also think that T&M/Electronics can show positive margin progression in 2016?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, we think we'll continue to make progress on operating margin in Test & Measurement. And in the fourth quarter, really nothing unusual other than what we've been talking about for almost three years now in terms of really strong execution of the enterprise initiatives, including 80/20 in that business. So very sustainable. More progress to come in 2016 and 2017.

Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. One, again, the comments you made about the sequential improvements in some of your industrial businesses was interesting. Can you comment on if that trend continued into January? And then, I guess, the second question is given the incremental lag-down we've seen in oil prices, what have you sort of baked into your guidance in 2016 in terms of risk, because you could see a lag effect there? Thanks.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So like we said earlier, no change in the month of January. We're on track to the guidance for the quarter. Oil and gas demand, while certainly down year-over-year, has remained stable. And like we said earlier, the primary impact there is on the Welding side and we expect that business to decline in the single-digits in 2016.
Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
All righty. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Well, it would be helpful if they could get my first name right. Morning. Just following up on the acquisition of ZF, as they would call it in Europe, how did that deal come about? For decades companies have been trying to get out of automotive supply. And it hasn't been deemed as a very attractive sector to be in. I'm curious, was this an auction process? ZF was trying to get rid of this business? Or did ITW approach ZF? I'm just curious how it all happened.
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I'm not sure that it's probably our place to comment on that. I think we're – it's a business that we've known about for a long time. I'll put it that way.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So you're not willing to comment on whether it was an auction?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You can ask them.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. No problem. And maybe you could just talk about the backlog then on the acquisition front? What are you seeing out there in terms of buyers versus sellers? Are we still looking at high expectations from sellers?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, my answer is we remain very much a niche player on the acquisition space. As we've talked about, our primary thrust remains on focus on making this pivot organic. So I'm not sure we're your best barometer. In terms of pipeline, we have a few segments that are in the ready-to-grow mode, largely who are now enabled to start to think about what might be complementary to what they're doing, but I would say, from a standpoint of our overall level of effort here, we wouldn't be a good barometer in terms of what's going on in the overall market.
Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. I'll leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Steve Fisher of UBS.
Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. Just two regional outlook questions. On Europe, we're seeing some mixed data points. What are you seeing and expecting for your overall business in aggregate in Europe in 2016? And then, similarly, with China, obviously, roughly, flat in the fourth quarter, but you had some big moving pieces with Automotive, quite a bit something else was down. How do you see China going forward in 2016 overall?
Ernest Scott Santi - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Yeah, so I think, Steve, kind of, big picture here. I mean, Europe was up a little more than 1% in 2015. We expect that to stay at the current run rate to be – in that range. Maybe a little better than that, driven, again, by strong presence in Automotive growing double-digits, or a big quarter in 2015, and more to come there. Food Equipment should have another really good year in that region. So more of the same, maybe a little bit better in Europe based on current run rates. China was flat essentially in the quarter, flat for the year. And we expect a similar environment going into 2016.
Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Aaron H. Hoffman - Vice President-Investor Relations
Great. And that brings us actually just past the top of the hour. So we're going to conclude the call there. Thanks to everyone for your time today and participation. And we'll talk to you of the first quarter in three months. Thank you.
