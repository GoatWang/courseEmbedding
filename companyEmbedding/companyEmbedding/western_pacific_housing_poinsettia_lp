Poinsettia Facts
10 Interesting Facts about Poinsettias

No flower says Christmas like the beautiful poinsettia. Learn a few facts about this traditional Christmas plant.
Poinsettias are part of the Euphorbiaceae or Spurge family. Botanically, the plant is known as Euphorbia pulcherrima.
Many plants in the Euphorbiaceae family ooze a milky sap. Some people with latex allergies have had a skin reaction (most likely to the sap) after touching the leaves. For pets, the poinsettia sap may cause mild irritation or nausea. Probably best to keep pets away from the plant, especially puppies and kittens.
Poinsettias are not poisonous. A study at Ohio State University showed that a 50-pound child would have to eat more than 500 leaves to have any harmful effect. Plus poinsettia leaves have an awful taste. You might want to keep your pets from snacking on poinsettia leaves. Eating the leaves can cause vomiting and diarrhea.
The showy colored parts of poinsettias that most people think of as the flowers are actually colored bracts (modified leaves).
Poinsettias have also been called the lobster flower and the flame-leaf flower, due to the red color.
Joel Roberts Poinsett introduced the poinsettia plant to the United States from Mexico. Poinsett was a botanist, physician and the first United States Ambassador to Mexico.
In Mexico the poinsettia is a perennial shrub that will grow 10-15 feet tall.
There are more than 100 varieties of poinsettias available today. Poinsettias come in colors like the traditional red, white, pink, burgundy, marbled and speckled.
The Paul Ecke Ranch in California grows over 70% of all Poinsettias purchased in the United States and does about 50% of the world-wide sales of Poinsettias.
December 12th is Poinsettia Day, which marks the death of Joel Roberts Poinsett in 1851.

What's in a Name?

Poinsettias are part of the Euphorbiaceae or Spurge family.      Botanically, the plant is known as Euphorbia      pulcherrima.
In Nahuatl , the language of the Aztecs, the Poinsettia was called Cuitlaxochitl (from cuitlatl,      for residue, and xochitl, for flower), meaning "flower that grows in      residues or soil." 
Today the plant is known in Mexico and Guatemala as      ""La      Flor de la Nochebuena" (Flower      of the Holy Night, or Christmas Eve). 
In Chile and Peru, the      Poinsettia is called the "Crown of the Andes". 
In Spain the Poinsettia has a different holiday attribution. It is      known there as "Flor de Pascua", meaning "Easter      flower".
Poinsettias have also been      called the lobster flower and the flame-leaf flower, due to the red color.
Poinsettias received their      name in the United        States in honor of Joel Roberts      Poinsett, who introduced the plant into the country in 1828. Poinsett was      a botanist, physician and the first United States Ambassador to Mexico. He      sent cuttings of the plant he had discovered in Southern       Mexico to his home in Charleston,       South Carolina. The word Poinsettia is traditionally      capitalized because it is named after a person.

Anatomy of a Poinsettia

The showy colored parts of Poinsettias      that most people think of as the flowers are actually colored bracts      (modified leaves). The yellow flowers, or cyathia, are in the center of the colorful bracts. The plant      drops its bracts and leaves soon after those flowers shed their pollen.      For the longest-lasting Poinsettias, choose plants with little or no      yellow pollen showing.
Many plants in the Euphorbiaceae family ooze a milky      sap. Some people with latex allergies have had a skin reaction (most      likely to the sap) after touching the leaves.
Despite rumors to the      contrary, Poinsettias are not poisonous. A study at Ohio State       University showed      that a 50-pound child would have to eat more than a pound-and-a-quarter of      Poinsettia leaves (500 to 600 leaves) to have any side effects. The most      common side effects that have been reported from Poinsettia ingestions are      upset stomach and vomiting. The leaves are reportedly not very tasty, so      it's highly unlikely that kids or even pets would be able to eat that      many! But be aware that the leaves can still be a choking hazard for      children and pets.
In nature, Poinsettias are      perennial flowering shrubs that were once considered weeds.
Poinsettias are not frost-tolerant. They will grow outdoors in      temperate coastal climates, such as Southern California beach      communities. In the ground, they      can reach 10 feet tall.
The colors of the bracts are created through "photoperiodism", meaning that they require darkness (12      hours at a time for at least five days in a row) to change color. On the other hand, once Poinsettias finish      that process, the plants require abundant light during the day for the      brightest color.

Great Moments in Poinsettia History

Poinsettias are native to Mexico. They are found in the wild in deciduous tropical forest at moderate      elevations from southern Sinaloa down the entire Pacific coast of Mexico      to Chiapas and Guatemala. They are      also found in the interior of Mexico in the hot, seasonally dry forests of      Gurerro and Oxaca.
December 12th is Poinsettia      Day, which marks the death of Joel Roberts Poinsett in 1851. 
In Mexico,      the Poinsettia is displayed in celebration of the "Dia de la Virgen", which is also coincidentally, December      12th. 
The Aztecs used the Poinsettia      bracts to make a reddish purple dye for fabrics, and used the sap      medicinally to control fevers. 
Montezuma, the last of the      Aztec Kings, had Poinsettias delivered to him by caravan to what is now Mexico City, because      Poinsettias could not be grown in the high altitude. 
Paul Ecke Jr. is considered      the father of the Poinsettia industry due to his discovery of a technique      which caused seedlings to branch. This technique allowed the Poinsettia      industry to flourish. The Paul Ecke Ranch in California grows over 70% of all Poinsettias      purchased in the United        States and about 50% of the world-wide      sales of Poinsettias. As of August 2012, the Ecke Ranch, which was      family-owned and operated for nearly 100 years, announced that it had been      acquired by the Dutch-based Agribio Group. 
The Ecke family had a secret      technique that caused every seedling to branch, resulting in a fuller      plant. In 1991, a university      graduate student published an article that described a method for causing Poinsettias      to branch. With the secret out and available to everyone, competition      flourished, especially from Europe,      resulting in a decrease of Ecke's share of the market. 
An NCAA college football      bowl game in San Diego      is named the Poinsettia Bowl. The      first bowl was played in December of 1952 and was created as a military      services championship game, with the Western and Eastern military services      champions competing against each other.

Poinsettias By the Numbers

There are over 100 varieties      of Poinsettias available. Though      once only available in red, there are now Poinsettias in pink, white,      yellow, purple, salmon, and multi-colors.      They have names like 'Premium Picasso', 'Monet Twilight', 'Shimmer',      and 'Surprise'.
The red Poinsettia still      dominates over other color options. 'Prestige      Red'--one of      many poinsettias patented by Ecke--ranks among the best-selling hybrids.
Poinsettias contribute over      $250 million to the U.S.      economy at the retail level. 
California is the top U.S. Poinsettia-producing      state.
Poinsettias are the best      selling potted plant in the United States and Canada. 
Poinsettias are the most      popular Christmas plant. Most Poinsettias      are sold within a six-week period leading up to that holiday, representing      some $60 million worth.
It is estimated that women      account for 80% of Poinsettia sales.
The most common question      people have about Poinsettias is how to get them to rebloom in successive      years.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Western Pacific Housing carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Western Pacific Housing



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Western Pacific Housing



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Western Pacific Housing



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
