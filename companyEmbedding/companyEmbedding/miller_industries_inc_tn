12 Series LCG™
Carrier






12 Series LCG™
Century brings a whole new dimension to transport with the 12 Series LCG™ (Low Center of Gravity) carrier. The patented design lowers the deck height 5” – 6” over conventional carriers. The lower height allows for the transport of taller loads, such as forklifts or man-lifts, that may be over-height on a conventional carrier and also provides better stability during transport.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Executive Overview  Miller Industries, Inc. is The World's Largest Manufacturer of Vehicle Towing and Recovery Equipment(R), with domestic manufacturing subsidiaries in Tennessee and Pennsylvania, and foreign manufacturing subsidiaries in France and the United Kingdom. We offer a broad range of equipment to meet our customers' design, capacity and cost requirements under our Century(R), Vulcan(R), Challenger(R), Holmes(R), Champion(R), Chevron(TM), Eagle(R), Titan(R), Jige(TM) and Boniface(TM) brand names. In this Item 2 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the words "Miller Industries," "the Company," "we," "our," "ours" and "us" refer to Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them.  Our management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor our overall operating and financial performance. These indicators include measurements of revenue, operating income, gross margin, earnings per share, capital expenditures and cash flow.  We derive revenues primarily from product sales made through our network of domestic and foreign independent distributors. Our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors including general economic conditions as well as demand for, and price of, our products, our technological competitiveness, our reputation for providing quality products and reliable service, competition within our industry, and the cost of raw materials (including aluminum, steel and petroleum-related products).  Our industry is cyclical in nature. In recent years, the overall demand for our products and resulting revenues have been positively affected by recovering economic conditions and improving consumer sentiment. However, historically, the overall demand for our products and our resulting revenues have at times been negatively affected by:   wavering levels of consumer confidence;   volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets and the resulting decrease in the availability of financing, including floor plan financing, for our customers and towing operators;   significant periodic increases in fuel and insurance costs and their negative effect on the ability of our customers to purchase towing and related equipment; and   the overall effects of the global economic downturn.  We remain concerned about the continuing effects of these factors on the towing and recovery industry, and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line with business conditions.  In addition, we have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the prices that we pay for raw materials, particularly aluminum, steel, petroleum-related products and other raw materials, which represent a substantial part of our total cost of operations. In the past, as we have determined necessary, we have implemented price increases to offset higher costs. We also developed alternatives to some of the components used in our production process that incorporate these raw materials, and our suppliers have implemented these alternatives in the production of our component parts. We continue to monitor raw material prices and availability in order to more favorably position the Company in this dynamic market.  At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $10,000 and $0 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates. Certain accounting policies are deemed "critical," as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. A discussion of critical accounting policies, the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows:  Accounts receivable  We extend credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues. While such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established, there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past.  Inventory  Inventory costs include materials, labor and factory overhead. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value), determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, valuation and other factors in determining net realizable value. Revisions of these estimates could result in the need for adjustments.  Long-lived assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. When a determination has been made that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be fully recovered, the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset's estimated fair value to its carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management or, if available, independent appraisals or sales price negotiations. The estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue, operating costs, interest rates, property and equipment additions, and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors. We believe that these estimates are reasonable, however, changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations. Based on these estimations, we believe that our long-lived assets are appropriately valued.  Goodwill  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying amount. We review goodwill for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step approach. If we choose to perform a qualitative analysis of goodwill and determine that the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further testing is needed. If we choose the two-step approach or if qualitative analysis determines the carrying value more likely than not exceeds fair value, the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value the second step is not necessary. If the carrying value is more than the fair value, the second step of testing is performed to compare the fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill. Such events might include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment or a material change in a relationship with significant customers.  Warranty reserves  We estimate expense for product warranty claims at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims. We review trends of warranty claims and take actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. We believe the warranty reserve is adequate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual.  Income taxes  We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We consider the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider tax loss carryforwards, reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning and estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. If unrecognized tax positions exist, we record interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax positions as income tax expense in our condensed consolidated statement of income.  Revenues  Under our accounting policies, revenues are recorded when the risk of ownership for products has transferred to independent distributors or other customers, which generally occurs on shipment. From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement. Recognition of revenue on bill and hold arrangements occurs when risk of ownership has passed to the customer, a fixed written commitment has been provided by the customer, the goods are complete and ready for shipment, the goods are segregated from inventory, no performance obligation remains, and a schedule for delivery has been established. While we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers, which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties, we frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers. Sales of company-purchased truck chassis are included in net sales. Margins are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing company-purchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal.  Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, historical rates for equity and the weighted average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders' equity. Intercompany debt denominated in a currency other than the functional currency is remeasured into the functional currency. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income.  Results of Operations-Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 increased 17.4% to $148,815 from $126,788 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increased demand levels in our domestic markets and corresponding increases in production levels based on recovering economic conditions and improving consumer sentiment.  Costs of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 increased 18.3% to $135,845 from $114,836 for the comparable period in 2015, which was attributable to the increased demand levels and increased production. Overall, costs of operations increased slightly as a percentage of sales from 90.6% to 91.3%.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 increased to $8,010 from $7,440 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. As a percentage of sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to 5.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 from 5.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses. Additionally, decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales resulted from lower sales-related expenses due to product mix during the quarter, as well as our continued focus on cost control.  Total interest expense increased to $198 from $163 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year period. Increases in interest expense were primarily due to increases in interest on distributor floor planning and on chassis purchases and borrowings under the credit facility.  Other (income) expense relates to foreign currency transaction gains and losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, other (income) expense was a net gain of $341, compared to a net loss of $56 for the three months ended March 31, 2015.  The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 reflects a combined effective U.S. federal, state and foreign tax rate of 34.2% and 28.6%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in the three month period ended March 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the lower corporate tax rates on the earnings of the European subsidiaries.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash used by operating activities was $7,693 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $3,057 for the comparable period in 2015. The cash provided by operating activities for the 2016 period was primarily attributable to consolidated net income. Cash used by operating activities reflects increases in accounts receivable due to increases in net sales as well as increases in inventory offset by increases in other components of working capital, including accounts payable. Certain components of accounts receivable and accounts payable have extended collection and payment terms.  Cash used in investing activities was $5,749 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1,415 for the comparable period in 2015. The cash used in investing activities for the 2016 period was primarily for the purchase of property, plant and equipment relating to the capital projects described below.  Cash provided by financing activities was $8,071 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to cash used in financing activities of $1,623 for the comparable period in 2015. The cash provided by financing activities for the 2016 period resulted from borrowings on the credit facility of $10,000 offset by the cash used to pay dividends for the 2016 period of $1,929.  As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $33,346, exclusive of unused availability under our credit facility. Our primary cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, the funding of any declared cash dividends and principal payments on indebtedness, if any, under our credit facility. At March 31, 2016, the Company had commitments of approximately $13,549 for construction and acquisition of property and equipment. We expect our primary sources of cash to be cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand at March 31, 2016, with borrowings under our credit facility being available if needed. We expect these sources to be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during 2016 and for the next several years. However, our ability to satisfy our cash needs will substantially depend upon a number of factors including our future operating performance, taking into account the economic and other factors discussed above and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $21,180 and $18,145, respectively, of the Company's cash and temporary investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and their holdings are generally based in the local currency. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S.  The Company is in the process of consolidating and expanding its Pennsylvania manufacturing operations to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies. The plan includes consolidating primary manufacturing operations at one location while plans for the remaining plant location continue to be evaluated. The current estimated costs of this project are approximately $23,712, including machinery and equipment, buildings and improvements and land. Approximately $11,972 of these costs were incurred as of March 31, 2016 and are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The remainder of these costs is expected to be incurred during 2016. The timing and costs of the project are subject to change. We do not anticipate any employee severance costs or any material relocation expense associated with the consolidation since the two existing facilities are very close to each other.  The Company also recently began several capital projects involving machinery and equipment and building improvements at its Ooltewah, Tennessee and Greeneville, Tennessee facilities that it estimates will cost in total approximately $15,233 through the end of 2016. Approximately $1,270 of these costs were incurred as of March 31, 2016.  Credit Facilities and Other Obligations  Credit Facility  On April 6, 2010 we entered into a Loan Agreement with First Tennessee Bank National Association for a $20,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. On December 21, 2011, the credit facility was renewed and our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to $25,000. On December 30, 2014, the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2017. On June 11, 2015, the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2018 and our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to $30,000 to give the Company greater flexibility to finance current capital expenditure projects. The current credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind. Covenants under the current credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends if the Company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividends, among various other restrictions.  In the absence of a default, all borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 1.50% per annum. The Company will pay a non-usage fee under the current loan agreement at a rate per annum equal to between 0.15% and 0.35% of the unused amount of the credit facility, which fee shall be paid quarterly.  At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $10,000 and $0 outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively.  Other Long-Term Obligations  At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1,416 in non-cancelable operating lease obligations.  May 04, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	Certain statements in this
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including but not limited to statements made in Part I, Item 2–“Management’s Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” statements made with respect to future operating results,
	expectations of future customer orders and the availability of resources necessary for our business may be deemed to be forward-looking
	statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by
	the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “continue,”
	“future,” “potential,” “believe,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,”
	“seek,” “estimate,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate” and similar expressions,
	or the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying
	or relating to any of the foregoing statements. Such forward-looking statements are made based on our management’s beliefs
	as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. These forward-looking statements are subject
	to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in consumer confidence; economic
	and market conditions; our customers’ access to capital and credit to fund purchases; our dependence on outside suppliers
	of raw materials; changes in the cost of aluminum, steel and related raw materials; changes in fuel and other transportation costs,
	insurance costs and weather conditions; changes in government regulation; various political, economic and other uncertainties relating
	to our international operations, including restrictive taxation and foreign currency fluctuation; competitors could impede our
	ability to attract or retain customers; our ability to develop or acquire proprietary products and technology; assertions against
	us relating to intellectual property rights; problems hiring or retaining skilled labor; a disruption in our information technology
	systems; the effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals; the catastrophic loss of one of our manufacturing facilities;
	environmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements; loss of the services of our key executives; product warranty
	or product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage; potential recalls of components or parts manufactured for us by
	suppliers or potential recalls of defective products; an inability to acquire insurance at commercially reasonable rates; and those
	other risks referenced herein, including those risks referred to in Part II, Item 1A–“Risk Factors” in this Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q and those risks discussed in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those
	risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 (as the same may
	be updated from time to time in subsequent quarterly reports), which discussion is incorporated herein by this reference. Such
	factors are not exclusive. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by, or
	on behalf of, our company.

	MILLER INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES





	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	(Unaudited)



	(in thousands, except share data and except as otherwise noted)




	 








	1.




	BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements
	of Miller Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant
	to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
	in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Nevertheless, the Company believes that the disclosures
	are adequate to make the financial information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited
	condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, to present fairly
	the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented. Cost of
	goods sold for interim periods for certain entities is determined based on estimated gross profit rates. Interim results of operations
	are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the fiscal year.


	 


	These condensed consolidated financial statements
	should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The condensed
	consolidated financial statements include accounts of certain subsidiaries whose fiscal closing dates differ from December 31

	st

	by 31 days (or less) to facilitate timely reporting. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
	presentation, with no impact on previously reported shareholders’ equity. The Company evaluated subsequent events through
	the date the financial statements were issued.

	BASIC AND DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE





	 


	Basic income per share is computed by dividing
	net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income per share is calculated by dividing net
	income by the weighted average number of common and potential dilutive common shares outstanding. Diluted income per share takes
	into consideration the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options resulting in approximately 30,000 and 28,000 potential dilutive
	common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	none of the outstanding stock options would have been anti-dilutive.



	 








	3.




	INVENTORIES





	 


	Inventory costs include materials, labor and
	factory overhead. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value), determined on a first-in, first-out
	basis. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, valuation and other factors in determining net realizable value. Revisions
	of these factors could result in the need for adjustments. Inventories, net of reserves, at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016
	consisted of the following:

	LONG-LIVED ASSETS





	 


	The Company periodically reviews the carrying
	amount of its long-lived assets to determine if those assets may be recoverable based upon the future operating cash flows expected
	to be generated by those assets. Management believes that its long-lived assets are appropriately valued.

	5.




	GOODWILL





	 


	Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of
	acquired entities over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not
	amortized. However, the Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually or if an event or circumstance
	occurs that would indicate that the carrying amount had been impaired. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment utilizing a
	qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we choose to perform a qualitative analysis of goodwill and determine that the
	fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further testing is needed. If we choose the two-step approach or
	if qualitative analysis determines the carrying value more likely than not exceeds fair value, the first step identifies potential
	impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value
	the second step is not necessary. If the carrying value is more than the fair value, the second step of testing is performed to
	compare the fair value of the goodwill with its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying
	value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value.

	LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS






	 




	Credit Facility and Other Long-Term Obligations





	 






	Credit Facility




	 


	On April 6, 2010 we entered into a Loan Agreement
	with First Tennessee Bank National Association for a $20,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. On December 21, 2011, our unsecured
	revolving credit facility was increased to $25,000. On June 11, 2015, the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity
	date to March 31, 2018 and our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to $30,000. On June 22, 2016, the credit facility
	was further increased to $50,000 to give the Company greater flexibility to finance current capital expenditure projects. On April
	5, 2017, the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to May 31, 2019. The current credit facility contains
	customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements
	of this kind. Covenants under the current credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends if the Company would be in violation
	of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among
	various restrictions. We have been in compliance with these covenants throughout 2016 and during the first quarter of 2017 and
	anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during the remainder of 2017.


	 


	In the absence of a default, all borrowings
	under the current credit facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 1.50% per annum. The Company will pay a non-usage fee under
	the current loan agreement at a rate per annum equal to between 0.15% and 0.35% of the unused amount of the current credit facility,
	which fee is paid quarterly.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the
	Company had $10,000 and $5,000 in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively. At April 28, 2017, the Company
	had $15,000 in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.




	 






	Interest Rate Risk




	 


	Changes in interest rates affect the interest
	paid on indebtedness under the credit facility because outstanding amounts of indebtedness under the credit facility are subject
	to variable interest rates. Under the credit facility, the non-default rate of interest was equal to the LIBOR Market Index Rate
	plus 1.50% per annum (for a rate of interest of 2.48% at March 31, 2017). At the borrowing level under the credit facility at March
	31, 2017, a one percent change in the interest rate on our variable-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial
	position, results of operations or cash flows for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.




	 






	Other Long-Term Obligations




	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1,505 in non-cancelable
	operating lease obligations.



	 








	7.




	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION





	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017
	and 2016, the Company did not issue any stock options and no stock options were exercised. For additional disclosures related to
	the Company’s stock-based compensation refer to Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
	Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES






	 




	Commitments



	 


	The Company has entered into arrangements with
	third-party lenders where it has agreed, in the event of default by a customer, to repurchase from the third-party lender Company
	products repossessed from the customer. These arrangements are typically subject to a maximum repurchase amount. The maximum amount
	of collateral that the Company could be required to purchase was approximately $49,393 at March 31, 2017, and $45,196 at December
	31, 2016. However, the Company’s risk under these arrangements is mitigated by the value of the products that would be repurchased
	as part of the transaction. The Company considered the fair value at inception of its liability under these arrangements and concluded
	that the liability associated with these potential repurchase obligations is not material and not probable at March 31, 2017.


	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company had commitments
	of approximately $14,097 for construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment. The Company is finalizing the consolidation
	and expansion of its Pennsylvania manufacturing operations to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies. The plan includes
	consolidating primary manufacturing operations at one location. The current estimated costs of this project are approximately $24,700,
	including machinery and equipment, buildings and improvements and land. Approximately $23,400 of these costs were incurred as of
	March 31, 2017 and are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The remainder of these
	costs are expected to be incurred during the second quarter of 2017. The timing and costs of the project are subject to change.
	We do not anticipate any employee severance costs or any material relocation expense associated with the consolidation since the
	two existing facilities are very close to each other. At March 31, 2017, we continued to utilize the remaining location for production
	of certain equipment and raw material inventory storage. In February 2017, the Company entered into a contingent agreement for
	the potential sale of the remaining plant location.


	 


	The Company also began several capital projects
	during 2016 involving machinery and equipment and building improvements at its Ooltewah, Tennessee and Greeneville, Tennessee facilities
	that it currently estimates will cost in total approximately $21,100. Approximately $12,500 of these costs were incurred as of
	March 31, 2017 and are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The remainder of these
	costs are expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2017. In addition, the Company intends to construct an administrative
	building at its Ooltewah, Tennessee facility. The current estimated costs of such project are approximately $4,200, which are expected
	to be incurred during 2017. The timing and cost of the project are subject to change.



	 




	Contingencies



	 


	The Company is, from time to time, a party
	to litigation arising in the normal course of its business. Litigation is subject to various inherent uncertainties, and it is
	possible that some of these matters could be resolved unfavorably to the Company, which could result in substantial damages against
	the Company. The Company has established accruals for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable and maintains product
	liability and other insurance that management believes to be adequate. Management believes that any liability that may ultimately
	result from the resolution of these matters in excess of available insurance coverage and accruals will not have a material adverse
	effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.



	 








	9.




	INCOME TAXES





	 


	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the Income Taxes topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the presentation
	of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement
	of financial position. The amendments will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December
	15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt
	this standard on a retrospective basis. The effect of this adoption was to present the Company’s deferred income tax accounts
	as a long-term deferred income tax liability on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and a long-term deferred
	income tax asset on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015.

	As of March 31, 2017, the Company has no federal
	or state net operating loss carryforwards.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 the Company had approximately
	$1,103 of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities, and we are uncertain about if or when such amounts may be settled.
	Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, the Company has also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $235 and interest
	of $20.


	 


	The Company is subject to United States federal
	income taxes, as well as income taxes in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax years 2015 and later
	tax years remain open to examination for U.S. federal income taxes. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state
	or non-U.S. income tax examinations prior to 2013.

	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	 




	Recently Issued Standards



	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance to change the recognition
	of revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to
	reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects
	to receive. In addition, during 2016 the FASB issued additional guidance to clarify certain implementation guidance previously
	issued and to rescind certain SEC guidance effective upon an entity’s adoption of the new standard. The guidance will be
	effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company plans to use the modified retrospective
	approach to implement the standard and is currently evaluating the effect that implementation will have on its consolidated financial
	position, results of operations and cash flows.


	 






	 



	10



	 







	 




	 


	The FASB's new leases standard Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)
	2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) was issued on February 25, 2016 and is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.
	The standard affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing
	equipment. The standard will require organizations that lease assets referred to as “Lessees” to recognize on the balance
	sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures
	designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
	These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded
	in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with
	lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and
	cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However,
	unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new standard will require both
	types of leases (i.e. operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB lessee accounting model will continue
	to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases
	are accounted for under existing GAAP. The operating lease will be accounted for in a manner similar to operating leases under
	existing GAAP, except that lessees will recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all of those leases.


	 


	The standard will be effective for
	financial statements issued for annual periods, and interim periods within these annual periods, beginning December 15, 2018,
	with early adoption permitted. See Note 6 for the Company’s current lease commitments. The Company plans to use the
	modified retrospective approach to implement the standard and is currently evaluating the effect that implementation will
	have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.


	 



	Recently Adopted Standards



	 


	In November 2015, the FASB amended the Income Taxes topic of the
	Accounting Standards Codification to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities
	and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments will be effective for financial
	statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early
	adoption permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard on a retrospective basis. The effect of this adoption
	was to present the Company’s deferred income tax accounts as a long-term deferred income tax liability on the consolidated
	balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and a long-term deferred income tax asset on the consolidated balance sheets as of December
	31, 2015.


	 


	In July 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Inventory topic
	of the Accounting Standards Codification to require inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Other
	than the change in the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable
	value for inventory, there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on measurement of inventory. The amendments will be
	effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption
	permitted. The Company adopted these amendments in the first quarter of 2017 and it did not have a material effect on its consolidated
	financial statements.

	ITEM 2.




	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	 




	Executive Overview



	 


	Miller Industries, Inc. is The World’s
	Largest Manufacturer of Vehicle Towing and Recovery Equipment

	®

	, with domestic manufacturing subsidiaries in Tennessee
	and Pennsylvania, and foreign manufacturing subsidiaries in France and the United Kingdom. We offer a broad range of equipment
	to meet our customers’ design, capacity and cost requirements under our Century

	®

	, Vulcan

	®

	,
	Challenger

	®

	, Holmes

	®

	, Champion

	®

	, Chevron™, Eagle

	®

	, Titan

	®

	,
	Jige™ and Boniface™ brand names. In this Item 2 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations,” the words “Miller Industries,” “the Company,” “we,”
	“our,” “ours” and “us” refer to Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them.


	 


	Our management focuses on a variety of key
	indicators to monitor our overall operating and financial performance. These indicators include measurements of revenue, operating
	income, gross margin, earnings per share, capital expenditures and cash flow.


	 


	We derive revenues primarily from product sales
	made through our network of domestic and foreign independent distributors. Our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors including
	general economic conditions as well as demand for, and price of, our products, our technological competitiveness, our reputation
	for providing quality products and reliable service, competition within our industry, and the cost of raw materials (including
	aluminum, steel and petroleum-related products).


	 


	Our industry is cyclical in nature. In recent
	years, the overall demand for our products and resulting revenues have been positively affected by favorable economic conditions,
	such as lower fuel prices, and positive consumer sentiment in our industry. However, historically, the overall demand for our products
	and our resulting revenues have at times been negatively affected by:


	 






	•


	wavering levels of consumer confidence;




	 






	•


	volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets and the resulting decrease in the availability
	of financing, including floor plan financing, for our customers and towing operators;




	 






	•


	significant periodic increases in fuel and insurance costs and their negative effect on the ability of our customers to purchase
	towing and related equipment; and




	 






	•


	the overall effects of global economic conditions.




	 


	We remain concerned about the effects of these
	factors on the towing and recovery industry, and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line
	with business conditions.


	 


	In addition, we have been and will continue
	to be affected by changes in the prices that we pay for raw materials, particularly aluminum, steel, petroleum-related products
	and other raw materials, which represent a substantial part of our total cost of operations. In the past, as we have determined
	necessary, we have implemented price increases to offset higher costs. We also developed alternatives to some of the components
	used in our production process that incorporate these raw materials, and our suppliers have implemented these alternatives in the
	production of our component parts. We continue to monitor raw material prices and availability in order to more favorably position
	the Company in this dynamic market.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the
	Company had $10,000 and $5,000 in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively. At April 28, 2017, the Company
	had $15,000 in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The borrowings under the credit facility were primarily used to
	finance our current capital expenditure projects for our Pennsylvania manufacturing operations and at our Ooltewah, Tennessee and
	Greeneville, Tennessee facilities.



	 




	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	Our condensed consolidated financial statements
	are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make
	estimates. Certain accounting policies are deemed “critical,” as they require management’s highest degree of
	judgment, estimates and assumptions. A discussion of critical accounting policies, the judgments and uncertainties affecting their
	application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different
	assumptions follows:




	 






	Accounts receivable




	 


	We extend credit to customers in the normal
	course of business. Collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained
	based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues. While such bad debt expenses have historically been
	within expectations and the allowance established, there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit
	loss rates as in the past.




	 








	 



	12



	 







	 






	 






	Inventory




	 


	Inventory costs include materials, labor and
	factory overhead. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value), determined on a first-in, first-out
	basis. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, valuation and other factors in determining net realizable value. Revisions
	of these estimates could result in the need for adjustments.




	 






	Long-lived assets




	 


	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
	whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. When a determination
	has been made that the carrying amount of long-lived asset may not be fully recovered, the amount of impairment is measured by
	comparing an asset’s estimated fair value to its carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on projected future
	cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management, or if available independent appraisals or sales price negotiations. The
	estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue, operating costs, interest rates, property
	and equipment additions, and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors. We believe
	that these estimates are reasonable; however, changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations. Based on these estimates,
	we believe that our long-lived assets are appropriately valued.




	 






	Goodwill




	 


	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually
	or if an event or circumstance occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying
	amount. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we choose to perform a
	qualitative analysis of goodwill and determine that fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further testing
	is needed. If we choose the two-step approach, the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the
	reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value the second step is not necessary. If the carrying
	value is more than the fair value, the second step of testing is performed to compare the fair value of the goodwill with its carrying
	value. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value. We
	cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill.
	Such events might include, but are not limited to, the impact of the economic environment or a material change in a relationship
	with significant customers.




	 






	Warranty reserves




	 


	We estimate expense for product warranty claims
	at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average
	cost of warranty claims. We review trends of warranty claims and take actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty
	claims. We believe the warranty reserve is adequate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates,
	requiring adjustments to the accrual.




	 






	Income taxes




	 


	Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets
	and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and
	future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments
	and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.


	 


	Deferred income taxes arise from temporary
	differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will
	result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the
	jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of
	deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions
	about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying
	businesses.


	 


	The calculation of our tax liabilities involves
	dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple foreign jurisdictions. ASC 740 states
	that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
	upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, on the basis of the technical merits.


	 


	We (1) record unrecognized tax benefits as
	liabilities in accordance with ASC 740 and (2) adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation
	of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution
	may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These
	differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.




	 








	 



	13



	 







	 






	 






	Revenues




	 


	Under our accounting policies, revenues are
	recorded when the risk of ownership for products has transferred to independent distributors or other customers, which generally
	occurs on shipment. From time to time, revenue is recognized under a bill and hold arrangement. Recognition of revenue on bill
	and hold arrangements occurs when risk of ownership has passed to the customer, a fixed written commitment has been provided by
	the customer, the goods are complete and ready for shipment, the goods are segregated from inventory, no performance obligation
	remains and a schedule for delivery has been established. While we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers, which are installed
	on truck chassis manufactured by third parties, we frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers. Sales of
	company-purchased truck chassis are included in net sales. Margin percentages are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles
	containing company-purchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal.




	 






	Foreign Currency Translation




	 


	The functional currency for our foreign operations
	is the applicable local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance
	sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, historical rates for equity and the weighted average
	exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders’
	equity. Intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured into the functional
	currency. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expense in our consolidated
	statements of income.



	 




	Results of Operations–Three Months Ended March 31, 2017
	Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016



	 


	Net sales for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 increased slightly to $148,933 from $148,815 for the comparable period in 2016. These historically strong levels of revenue
	were primarily attributable to continued solid demand in our domestic and international markets based on positive consumer sentiment.
	Domestic net sales for the period decreased from $133,620 to $130,678 offset by an increase in foreign net sales for the period
	from $15,195 to $18,255.


	 


	Costs of operations for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 decreased 1.7% to $133,538 from $135,845 for the comparable period in 2016. Overall, costs of operations decreased
	as a percentage of sales from 91.3% to 89.7% primarily due to product mix and continued efforts to monitor costs while meeting
	customer demand.


	 


	Selling, general, and administrative expenses
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased to $9,044 from $8,010 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase
	in expense was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs related to an increase in staffing levels. As a percentage of
	sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 6.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 5.4% for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	Total interest expense increased to $378 from
	$198 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period. Increases in interest expense were primarily
	due to increases in interest on distributor floor planning and on chassis purchases and borrowings under the credit facility.


	 


	Other (income) expense, net relates to foreign
	currency translation gains and losses. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, other (income) expense, the net gain of $14 compared
	to a net gain of $341 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	The provision for income taxes for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 reflects a combined effective U.S. federal, state and foreign tax rate of 35.9% and 34.2%,
	respectively.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	Cash used by operating activities was $3,077
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash used by operating activities of $7,691 for the comparable period in
	2016. The cash provided by operating activities for the 2017 period was primarily attributable to consolidated net income. Cash
	used by operating activities reflects increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses offset by increases in
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Certain components of accounts receivable and accounts payable have extended collection
	and payment terms.


	 


	Cash used in investing activities was $6,393
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $5,749 for the comparable period in 2016. The cash used in investing activities
	for the 2017 period was primarily for the purchase of property, plant and equipment relating to the capital projects described
	below.


	 


	Cash provided by financing activities was $2,957
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8,071 for the comparable period
	in 2016. The cash provided by financing activities for the 2017 period resulted from borrowings on the credit facility of $5,000
	offset by the cash used to pay dividends for the 2017 period of $2,043.


	 






	 



	14



	 







	 




	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017,
	we borrowed a total of $15,000 and repaid a total of $10,000 under our credit facility. At April 28, 2017, our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility increased to $15,000 from $10,000
	at March 31, 2017. All of the borrowings under the credit
	facility during 2017 were primarily used to finance our current capital expenditure projects for our Pennsylvania manufacturing
	operations and our Ooltewah, Tennessee and Greeneville, Tennessee facilities.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and
	cash equivalents of $24,499 not including $40,000 of unused availability under our credit facility. Our primary cash
	requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, the funding of any declared cash dividends and principal payments
	on indebtedness. At March 31, 2017, the Company had commitments of approximately $14,097 for construction and acquisition of
	property and equipment. We expect our primary sources of cash to be cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents on
	hand at March 31, 2017 and additional borrowings under our credit facility as needed. We expect these sources to be
	sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during 2017 and for the next several years. However, our ability to satisfy our cash
	needs will substantially depend upon a number of factors including our future operating performance, taking into account the
	economic and other factors discussed above and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as financial, business and other
	factors, many of which are beyond our control.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
	$23,710 and $21,675, respectively, of the Company’s cash and temporary investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and
	their holdings are generally based in the local currency. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income
	taxation on repatriation to the U.S.


	 


	The Company is finalizing the consolidation
	and expansion of its Pennsylvania manufacturing operations to increase capacity and improve operating efficiencies. The plan includes
	consolidating primary manufacturing operations at one location. The current estimated costs of this project are approximately $24,700,
	including machinery and equipment, buildings and improvements and land. Approximately $23,400 of these costs were incurred as of
	March 31, 2017 and are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The remainder of these
	costs are expected to be incurred during the second quarter of 2017. The timing and costs of the project are subject to change.
	We do not anticipate any employee severance costs or any material relocation expense associated with the consolidation since the
	two existing facilities are very close to each other. At March 31, 2017, we continued to utilize the remaining location for production
	of certain equipment and raw material inventory storage. In February 2017, the Company entered into a contingent agreement for
	the potential sale of the remaining plant location.


	 


	The Company also began several capital projects
	during 2016 involving machinery and equipment and building improvements at its Ooltewah, Tennessee and Greeneville, Tennessee facilities
	that it currently estimates will cost in total approximately $21,100. Approximately $12,500 of these costs were incurred as of
	March 31, 2017 and are included in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The remainder of these
	costs are expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2017. In addition, the Company intends to construct an administrative
	building at its Ooltewah, Tennessee facility. The current estimated costs of such project are approximately $4,200, which are expected
	to be incurred during 2017. The timing and cost of the project are subject to change.



	 




	Credit Facilities and Other Obligations





	 






	Credit Facility




	 


	On April 6, 2010 we entered into a Loan Agreement
	with First Tennessee Bank National Association for a $20,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. On December 21, 2011, our unsecured
	revolving credit facility was increased to $25,000. On June 11, 2015, the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity
	date to March 31, 2018 and our unsecured revolving credit facility was increased to $30,000. On June 22, 2016, the credit facility
	was further increased to $50,000 to give the Company greater flexibility to finance current capital expenditure projects. On April
	5, 2017, the credit facility was further renewed to extend the maturity date to May 31, 2019. The current credit facility contains
	customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements
	of this kind. Covenants under the current credit facility restrict the payment of cash dividends if the Company would be in violation
	of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among
	various restrictions. We have been in compliance with these covenants throughout 2016 and during the first quarter of 2017 and
	anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during the remainder of 2017.


	 


	In the absence of a default, all borrowings
	under the credit facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 1.50% per annum. The Company will pay a non-usage fee under the
	current loan agreement at a rate per annum equal to between 0.15% and 0.35% of the unused amount of the credit facility, which
	fee is paid quarterly.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the
	Company had $10,000 and $5,000 in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, respectively. At April 28, 2017, the Company
	had $15,000 in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The borrowings under the credit facility were primarily used to
	finance our current capital expenditure projects for our Pennsylvania manufacturing operations and at our Ooltewah, Tennessee and
	Greeneville, Tennessee facilities.




	 








	 



	15



	 







	 






	 






	Other Long-Term Obligations




	 


	At March 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,505
	in non-cancelable operating lease obligations.




	 












	ITEM 3.




	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK





	 


	In the normal course of our business, we are
	exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations
	and financial position.



	 




	Interest Rate Risk



	 


	Changes in interest rates affect the interest
	paid on indebtedness under our credit facility because the outstanding amounts of indebtedness under our credit facility are subject
	to variable interest rates. Under our credit facility, the non-default rate of interest was equal to the LIBOR Market Index Rate
	plus 1.50% per annum (for a rate of interest of 2.48% at March 31, 2017). At the borrowing level under the credit facility at March
	31, 2017, a one percent change in the interest rate on our variable-rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial
	position, results of operations or cash flows for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.



	 




	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk



	 


	We are subject to risk arising from changes
	in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international operations in Europe. We manage our exposure to our foreign currency
	exchange rate risk through our regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into certain
	forward foreign currency exchange contracts.


	 


	Because we report in U.S. dollars on a consolidated
	basis, foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial position. At March 31, 2017, we
	recognized a $111 decrease in our foreign currency translation adjustment account compared with December 31, 2016 because of fluctuations
	of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies compared to a $59 increase for the prior year period.


	 


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our results of operations and cash flows was a net gain of $14 and
	a net gain of $341, respectively.



	 











	ITEM 4.




	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 


	Within 90 days prior to the filing date of
	this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our co-Chief
	Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon this evaluation, our
	CEOs and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be
	disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
	the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.


	 


	There were no significant changes in our internal
	controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of this evaluation.

	PART II. OTHER INFORMATION




	 












	ITEM 1.




	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS





	 


	We are, from time to time, a party to litigation
	arising in the normal course of our business. Litigation is subject to various inherent uncertainties, and it is possible that
	some of these matters could be resolved unfavorably to us, which could result in substantial damages against us. We have established
	accruals for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable and maintain product liability and other insurance that management
	believes to be adequate. Management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters
	in excess of available insurance coverage and accruals will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
	or results of operations.

My new 16 series 26' all...umium roll back carrier and wheel lift have soooo many completely backwards to best practice flaws/defects I would never have expected that from the Industries core manufacturer. From work lights installed in non ideal/exposed to be damaged, not using bolts that resist corrosion, bad welds, wheel lift boots unfinished sharp metal obviously cut and not touched to remove burrs. Formerly had a Killar deck and looking back I see, for as small as they are they were miles ahead in so many aspects of their build quality. 展开Milan Bozovich · 2017年6月22日i bought a 2016 international  rollback that i ordered new with a century steel bed in nov 2015 by march 2016 it was rusted very badly was told to wait till the... new plant was p and running in penn and they would repaint the bed and replace all the galvinized wheel lift parts that were also totally rusted i thought they should have replaced the bed seeing it was suppose to be new which had touched up rust spots already which lynch had pictures of it when i called them out to look at it but instead they took it to penn and repainted the bed in dec 2016 in feb 2017 it was rusted allover worse than the first time so now im getting the run around for the second time everone has to talk to everyone and didnt get nothing done sent miller 46 pictures of the rust it looks so bad everyone that sees my truck thinks i bought a used truck so ihave a 100.000 rust bucket you can scratch the paint off with your finger nail  and when i asked about the warranty on the bed i never got a straight answer also my truck is garaged it doesnt sit out in the weather totally disgusted i think its time to let my lawyer take it from here i will post some of the pictures so you can see their fine so called workmanship so be aware when buying a new truck bed from miller industries 展开Nate Buckler · 2017年3月7日I've had good times with Miller, as well as some bad times.

Drizly launches alcohol-delivery service in Columbus

Country singers, fraternity brothers and anxious hostesses won't have to go on a beer run this New Year's Eve if alcohol supplies run low. This year, in several Columbus neighborhoods at least, restocking adult beverages no longer will require keys or a car - just a smartphone and a credit card.

				JD Malone, The Columbus Dispatch
			
Country singers, fraternity brothers and anxious hostesses won't have to go on a beer run this New Year's Eve if alcohol supplies run low. This year, in several Columbus neighborhoods at least, restocking adult beverages no longer will require keys or a car - just a smartphone and a credit card. Locally-owned Refill can drop booze and beer at your doorstep. And this month, Boston-based Drizly, an online and mobile alcohol ordering service, launched here and in two other Ohio markets - Akron and suburban Cleveland, as well as Middletown. "The service is e-commerce for alcohol," said Nick Rellas, CEO of Drizly. "It is a pretty simple idea: letting you shop for alcohol on your phone." Mobile and online ordering has become the norm for a host of everyday items, from shoes to shaving cream. Consumers can order groceries at Giant Eagle and Kroger via their phone and arrange for pick up. And there are numerous restaurant ordering/delivery platforms like Grubhub, Cafe Courier and Amazon Restaurants. Even Wendy's opened an office across from Ohio State University that focuses on improving its mobile ordering and other technologies. So it was perhaps inevitable that alcohol sales have made the move to mobile ordering and delivery. "There is clearly a tremendous amount of digital ordering," said David Portalatin, vice president and food industry analyst at the NPD Group. "The consumer is rapidly adopting it ... to get what they want where they want it." Yet alcohol has befuddled such enterprises before. Drinkos, which offered alcohol ordering and delivery, opened here in 2015 and didn't last a year. Refill also opened in 2015 and plans to expand into Cleveland and Cincinnati next year. Drizly has a longer track record. At five years old, it's well-established for a mobile-ordering software company, and operates in more than 40 cities. Further, the company has experience navigating alcohol laws that vary state to state and that often date from the end of Prohibition. The other thing going for it is that retailers seem to like the concept and will keep trying some version of mobile ordering because an increasing number of customers want it. "People ask all the time; it is a very common question," said Gursev Sidhu, owner of Arena Wine and Spirits, Drizly's initial partner in Columbus. "We had been looking to do delivery for two or three years, but we had no system to do it with. We couldn't do it on the fly." Sidhu has two regular delivery drivers and a pair of substitutes who can fill in. His drivers are trained to combat underage drinking, something Drizly takes very seriously. Drizly requires that an identification card be presented and scanned at the time of delivery. "It is very thorough," he said. "When we do ID checking, you have to check anyone you can see from the door. If it's fishy, we don't (complete the delivery)." Sidhu also takes orders from Refill. Drizly plans to expand to more retailers as it expands its service in Columbus. Drizly is offering delivery to Downtown, German Village, Clintonville, Upper Arlington, the University District and Grandview Heights, areas Sidhu can't usually reach from his Arena District store. Refill can reach most of the neighborhoods inside Interstate 270 as well as Pickerington. "(The services) reach areas where we do not," Sidhu said. That's one reason services like Refill and Drizly, and Amazon Restaurants, are likely to see a lot of growth in the years to come. A good mobile ordering platform gives stores a way to reach additional customers in a format those customers prefer, Portalatin said. Refill can be accessed through its website, www.alcoholtogo.com, and via its app. Its service includes delivery of beer, wine and spirits. Drizly can be accessed through its website, www.drizly.com, and by downloading its app. Its offerings include beer and wine - no liquor just yet - and it is offering free delivery for first-time orders to promote its launch, but delivery runs around $5 in most markets. Refill charges $6.99 for delivery. There is also a minimum order set by retailers. For Arena Wine and Spirits the minimum order is $19.  jmalone@dispatch.com

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
