What mistakes am I making with my money?

Everybody wants to have extra cash at the end of the month. Even better if there's enough to add to your savings or to put toward retirement. But in reality, that doesn't always happen. Here are six common money mistakes you can avoid to create better money habits. Mistake #1: Spending your whole paycheck Sometimes it's fun to be a big spender, but you can't do it all the time. Instead, set up automatic withdrawals to a savings account the same day your paycheck goes in. Then, you won't even have to think about saving. Mistake #2: Buying coffee every morning and eating out too often. We all have our favorite places to eat, but if you make coffee at home and eat in more often than not, you can easily save a few hundred dollars a month just by living within your means. Mistake #3: Treating your credit card like another source of income. Sure, it seems like charging one tank of gas isn't a big deal. But small things add up quickly when you don't pay off your balance every month. Mistake #4: Having zero financial goals. Yes, it's important to cultivate friendships, have fun, and to travel. But, think beyond this year. Set some long-term goals and stick to them so you can enjoy what's ahead. Mistake #5: Failing to meet your 401(k) employer match. If your boss hands you an extra three percent of your salary, you say "thanks" and take it. That's exactly what happens when your company matches a percentage of what you save toward retirement. So take the maximum your company gives you. Don't leave free money on the table. Mistake #6: Neglecting to plan for retirement. Even if your company doesn't have a retirement plan in place, start saving today. The compound interest you earn from starting now can be astronomical compared with what you'll have if you delay. So avoid these mistakes. Create good money habits now and you'll increase your quality of life today and tomorrow.

















How often should I do a financial check-up?


Conducting a mid-year check-up on key financial areas—budget, credit score, retirement savings, life insurance—will allow you to adjust if needed to keep your annual financial goals on track. Here are some important aspects of a financial check-up.


start of article



Conducting a financial check-up
Hold your own budget summitHas your budget changed? Evaluate your spending habits and reset goals if needed. If you got a raise or a new job, maybe you can afford to save more each month. If you don't already have a budget, start one—a mid-year financial check-up still gives you six months to make a difference.

Optimize your tax breaksAre you taking advantage of opportunities to lower your taxable income by paying into a tax-advantaged retirement account? Are you maximizing contributions to your retirement plan? For example, say you were able to contribute $18,000 in pretax dollars to your 401(k) or 403(b) in 2016. For those aged 50 and older, it's possible to make a catch-up contribution of as much as $6,000, which increases your 2016 total to $24,000.

Get reacquainted with your investmentsWhile it can be good to leave your investments alone, it's also a good idea to review your portfolio once a year. Consider your financial goals and assess risk level compared with the market's year-to-date performance and make any adjustments to keep you on pace with your financial goals.

Revisit insurance coverageAre the liability limits you have still high enough to protect your assets? If you've done any home improvements or upgrades, consider whether your policy is high enough to replace your home and possessions if needed.

Evaluate your debtLook at your credit card balances and other loans. Is your balance creeping up? Maybe you need to make some budget adjustments or consider refinancing to lower interest rates.

Estate planningEstate plans and wills only need to be reviewed every five years or so, but consider making this part of your mid-year financial check-up if a life change has happened, such as marriage, divorce, birth or death. This would also be a good time to look at life insurance and retirement account beneficiary designations to ensure they match the rest of your estate plan.

Bottom lineDoing a mid-year financial check-up might seem like a lot of work, but it will help protect you, your loved ones and everything you've worked hard for.

So avoid these mistakes. Create good money habits now and you'll increase your quality of life today and tomorrow.

















How often should I do a financial check-up?


Conducting a mid-year check-up on key financial areas—budget, credit score, retirement savings, life insurance—will allow you to adjust if needed to keep your annual financial goals on track. Here are some important aspects of a financial check-up.


start of article



Conducting a financial check-up
Hold your own budget summitHas your budget changed? Evaluate your spending habits and reset goals if needed. If you got a raise or a new job, maybe you can afford to save more each month. If you don't already have a budget, start one—a mid-year financial check-up still gives you six months to make a difference.

Optimize your tax breaksAre you taking advantage of opportunities to lower your taxable income by paying into a tax-advantaged retirement account? Are you maximizing contributions to your retirement plan? For example, say you were able to contribute $18,000 in pretax dollars to your 401(k) or 403(b) in 2016. For those aged 50 and older, it's possible to make a catch-up contribution of as much as $6,000, which increases your 2016 total to $24,000.

Get reacquainted with your investmentsWhile it can be good to leave your investments alone, it's also a good idea to review your portfolio once a year. Consider your financial goals and assess risk level compared with the market's year-to-date performance and make any adjustments to keep you on pace with your financial goals.

Revisit insurance coverageAre the liability limits you have still high enough to protect your assets? If you've done any home improvements or upgrades, consider whether your policy is high enough to replace your home and possessions if needed.

Evaluate your debtLook at your credit card balances and other loans. Is your balance creeping up? Maybe you need to make some budget adjustments or consider refinancing to lower interest rates.

Estate planningEstate plans and wills only need to be reviewed every five years or so, but consider making this part of your mid-year financial check-up if a life change has happened, such as marriage, divorce, birth or death. This would also be a good time to look at life insurance and retirement account beneficiary designations to ensure they match the rest of your estate plan.

Bottom lineDoing a mid-year financial check-up might seem like a lot of work, but it will help protect you, your loved ones and everything you've worked hard for.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
