IPO Preview: Tabula Rasa HealthCare Inc. - Tabula Rasa HealthCare (NASDAQ:TRHC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»IPO Preview: Tabula Rasa HealthCare Inc.Sep.27.16 | About: Tabula Rasa (TRHC) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummaryNew Jersey-based TRHC provides technology-enabled products and services for medication management and risk adjustment.The company is set to price its NASDAQ IPO this Wednesday evening, Sept. 28; lead underwriters are UBS Investment Bank and Wells Fargo Securities.TRHC plans to offer 4.3 million shares at an expected price range of $13 to $15; we hear the deal is in high demand and may price at the high end.We are keen on the company's valuation, reported growth, and market opportunity and suggest investors consider an allocation.Tabula Rasa HealthCare (NASDAQ:TRHC) expects to raise $52.4 million in its upcoming IPO ($60.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares). Based in Moorestown, New Jersey, Tabula Rasa HealthCare is a provider of technology-enabled products and services for medication management and risk adjustment. We previewed this deal on our IPO Insights platform. Tabula Rasa HealthCare will offer 4.3 million shares at an expected price range of $13 to $15. If the underwriters price the IPO at the midpoint of that range, TRHC will have a market capitalization of $226.16 million. TRHC filed for the IPO on January 4, 2016. Lead Underwriters: UBS Investment Bank and Wells Fargo Securities Underwriters: Piper Jaffray & Co., Robert W. Baird & Co., and Stifel Nicolaus & Co. While some risks are present, we like the company and the deal and suggest investors to buy this IPO. Business Summary: Provider of Products and Services for Medication Management and Risk Adjustment Tabula Rasa HealthCare, Inc. provides patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions; these enable healthcare organizations to optimize medication regimens. Tabula's solutions aim to enhance patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and lower healthcare costs. The company's cloud-based software applications include EireneRx, which is used by at-risk healthcare organizations to access its patients' medication-related information; MedWise Advisor that allows for components of EireneRx to be used independently and by a broader healthcare audience; and NiaRx, an educational software platform used in the pharmacy educational community. The company also serves prescribers and pharmacists.
 Use of Proceeds And Highlights From Management's Analysis The company's product revenue is generated through medication risk management contracts with healthcare organizations. Tabula's MRM Matrix technology enables pharmacists to optimize tailored medication programs. In 2015, Tabula began offering software solutions as standalone software-as-a-service; currently, all of the company's medication risk management clients have opted for bundled services. No revenue has been derived from standalone offerings. According to management, quarterly revenue has grown consistently from $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2013 to $22.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. 

 (Source: SEC Filings) For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016, product sales represented 84% and 89%, respectively, of total revenue, and service revenue represented 16% and 11%, respectively, of total revenue. Impressive revenue retention and client retention rates were 99% and 96%, respectively, for 2015, and 95% and 97%, respectively, for 2014. Tabula Rasa HealthCare intends to use the net proceeds of this IPO to pay down approximately $30 million in outstanding loans, pay acquisition costs for certain assets and intellectual property, and for general corporate purposes. Potential Competition: Siemens Pharmacy, RxConnect, PharmNet and Others The pharmaceutical industry does offer competition in information systems. Peers include Meditech Pharmacy Solutions, Horizon Meds Manager (NASDAQ:HZNP), PharmNet, Willow from EpicCare, CPSI, HMS Pharmacy, Siemens Pharmacy, RxConnect, Sunrise Pharmacy, and Mediware. Yet Tabula notes in its SEC filings that it believes it is unique in its comprehensive medication risk management system.
 Using sales for the last twelve months ended June 30, 2016, Tabula has a very reasonable P/S multiple of 2.81, while competitor HZNP has a slightly P/S multiple of 3.4 (industry average 3.3) (Source: Morningstar public research). Executive Management Highlights Dr. Calvin Knowlton, BScPharm, MDiv, PhD, founded Tabula Rasa and serves as Chairman and CEO. He also founded CareKinesis, Inc., and Enclara Pharmacia, Inc. He served as Professor and Department Chair for the University of Sciences in Philadelphia in the 1990s. Dr. Knowlton received his BA from Rider College, Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from Temple University, Masters in Divinity from Princeton University, and PhD in Pharmacoeconomics from the University of Maryland. CFO Brian Adams has served in his position since June 2016. His previous experience comes from positions at CareKinesis, KPMG LLP, and excelleRx Inc. Mr. Adams earned his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Richmond. Conclusion: Consider An IPO Allocation TRHC shows strong revenue growth, plans to use net proceeds from its IPO to pay down debt, and is priced competitively. In addition, the space for patient risk management solutions is large and growing. At its current valuation, we are positive on this IPO and anticipate purchasing shares this week. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.6 million and $5.6 million for year 2015 and last six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. At present, we hear the deal demand is strong and pricing could be at the upper end of the proposed range or higher.

Tabula Rasa Healthcare, Inc. Key Developments

Tabula Rasa Healthcare Inc. Signs First Licensing Deal
May 2 17
Tabula Rasa HealthCare Inc. has, for the first time, licensed the use of its medication risk mitigation technology to an outside organization. The Moorestown, N.J., company has entered into an agreement that provides access for its MedWise Advisor technology to Landmark, a national medical group based in Huntington Beach, Calif., that focuses exclusively on chronically ill patients. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The MedWise Advisor platform will be used by Landmark clinicians to identify opportunities to improve the safety of their members' medication profiles. In Addition Tabula Rasa's pharmacist-staffed call centers also will provide as-needed clinical support to Landmark's clinicians. First phase of the program will be launched by Landmark in two of its markets, California and New York. Knowlton said existing medication management software only looks at one-to-one drug interactions and don't take into account patients on multiple prescriptions and over-the-counter medications. Tabula Rasa's technology is designed not only to protect the safety of patients on numerous medications, its clinical support tools also help clinicians make choices to improve medication outcomes.

About Us
[ how we help improve lives ]


 










Tabula rasa, means “blank slate” in Latin and references the Roman wax tablet used for notes. These tablets were blanked by heating then smoothing the wax, to give a tabula rasa. Contemporary translation includes “fresh start” or “new beginning.”
The Tabula Rasa HealthCare (TRHC) provides new beginnings for our clients, through innovative service models and fresh approaches to healthcare. Our leaders understand that to maximize patient experiences and outcomes, they must help providers to balance efficiency and scalability with safety and individualization of care. Our culture, the TRHC Way, promotes this mentality.
TRHC provides patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions that enable healthcare organizations to optimize medication regimens. We improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs, and manage risk. We deliver our solutions through a comprehensive suite of technology-enabled products and services for medication risk management and risk adjustment.
With 4.3 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. in 2014, medication treatment is the most common medical intervention. Its imprecise use represents the fourth leading cause of death and contributes to an estimated 45 to 50 million adverse drug events, or ADEs, annually. ADEs result in more than 100,000 deaths annually, approximately 125,000 hospitalizations, and one million emergency room visits. Incidence of ADEs is highly correlated to the number of medications an individual is taking and to non-adherence, and thus is particularly relevant to populations with complex healthcare needs.
As the U.S. healthcare market continues to evolve from fee-for-service to value-based models of care, healthcare organizations require new and emerging technologies to optimize treatment and manage risk on a patient-specific, customized basis. Our solutions are targeted to at-risk organizations that are clinically and financially responsible for the populations they serve.
Our suite of cloud-based software solutions provides prescribers, pharmacists and healthcare organizations with sophisticated and innovative tools to better manage the medication-related needs of patients. TRHC offers a prospective clinical approach to medication risk management, designed to increase patient safety and promote medication regimen adherence. Furthermore, our medication risk management technology helps healthcare organizations lower costs by reducing ADEs, enhancing quality of care, and avoiding preventable hospital admissions.

Style Scores:



D Value | D Growth | C Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
