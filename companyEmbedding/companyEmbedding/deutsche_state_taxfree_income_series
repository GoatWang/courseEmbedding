    R-001814.7 (2/17) Additional Performance InformationFund performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Important Objectives, Strategy and Risk InformationThe fund seeks a high level of current income that is exempt from New York State and New York City personal income taxes\and federal income taxes.Regardless of market conditions, fund managers use a risk-focused management style and seek to preserve principal. They don’t seek additional yield if doing so would, in their opinion, put investor capital at risk. Unlike some competitors, managers don’t try to predict the direction of interest rates.Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. The fund invests in inverse floaters, which are derivatives that involve leverage and could magnify the fund’s gains or losses. This fund is non-diversified and can take larger positions in fewer issues, increasing its potential risk. Although the fund seeks income that is exempt from New York and federal income taxes, a portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, including the alternative minimum tax. See the prospectus for details.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Morningstar® Fixed Income Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s average effective maturity or duration and the average credit rating of the bond portfolio. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar® category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar® category is estimated.Morningstar Risk is based on the calculation of the difference between the Morningstar Return (adjusted for loads and excess over the risk-free rate) and the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return (adjusted for loads, excess over risk-free rate and risk). The calculation results in a rating system such that for each time period (3-, 5-, 10-years), the top 10% are given a risk score of 5 or High, next 22.5% of 4 or Above Average, next 35% of 3 or Average, next 22.5% of 2 or Below Average and the bottom 10% of 1 or Low.Source: Morningstar, Inc. Beta is a historical measure of a fund’s sensitivity to the movements of the fund’s benchmark index. A fund with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the benchmark. A fund with a beta less than 1 is less volatile.Source: Morningstar, Inc. R-squared (R2) is a historical measure that indicates how closely a fund’s past fluctuations have correlated with those of the fund’s benchmark. An R2 of 100% means that all movements of a fund are explained by benchmark movements. Both beta and R2 are based on a 3-year period relative to the index. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Standard deviation is a 3-year statistical measure of the volatility of a fund’s returns. Generally, the greater the standard deviation, the greater the fund’s volatility.Source: Morningstar, Inc. Turnover rate is the rate of trading activity in a fund’s portfolio of investments, equal to the lesser of purchases or sales, for a year, divided by average total assets for that year.Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any available maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.
