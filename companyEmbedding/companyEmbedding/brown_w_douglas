I have enjoyed seeing the changes in this dynamic university over the past years and look forward to being part of the next chapter in its growth”. Brown served as a vice president, general counsel and secretary of Air Products & Chemicals Inc., from 1999 until his retirement in 2007.

Bobbi Brown on Reinvention, YouTubers and the One Product She Can't Live Without | Allure































ToggleCloseSubscribeNewsletter Sign UpCloseGoMakeupFaceBobbi Brown on Reinvention, YouTubers and the One Product She Can't Live WithoutBy Kristen BatemankristenvbatemanJune 8, 2017facebook dialogPinterestfacebook dialogPinterestEmailMegan ThomasIt's been just a little over six months since Bobbi Brown announced she'd be leaving her namesake makeup line, yet already she's released her ninth book (Beauty From the Inside Out: Makeup, Wellness, Confidence) and announced her plan to renovate a hotel in her hometown of Montclair, New Jersey, with her husband, Steven Plofker.The iconic makeup artist, author, former editor and brand founder launched her brand at Bergdorf Goodman in 1991 and sold it to Estee Lauder just a few years later, in 1995. She made a name for herself with products that suited a wide variety of skin tones as well as products that were made to look more your real skin, lip color and cheeks than actual makeup. "I got a lot of inspiration, and I still do, from people's skin and their faces," she said, referring to the time she created a lip stain inspired by the way her three sons' lips looked after eating popsicles.You May Also LikeMakeupKim Kardashian Just Proved that Your Perfect Nude Lip Color Matches Your NipplesMakeupCoverGirl Is Not Happy About Young Thug’s Easy Breezy Beautiful Thugger Girls Video"I think the most important thing is the overall message which, to me, is about how to take care of yourself from the inside out," said Brown of her brand new book, during a conversation with Christene Barberich at the "Fresh" themed pop-up concept shop Story on a grey and humid New York City night.Brown curated a few of her favorite wellness products for the shop, which rotates themes every four to eight weeks (this time was in partnership with Jet.com), and was in-person to talk about everything from her views of teenage beauty today to her morning routine. At the end of the talk, she responded to an audience member's question of "What's next?" with the possibly of doing more in the wellness space, too — though she couldn't divulge just what exactly she'll be up to yet.We sat down with Brown right before the event to talk about no-makeup makeup, YouTubers, beauty regrets and more:Your latest book is about beauty from the inside out, but there's also a bit about personal reinvention. Is there a specific moment in your life when you feel your reinvented yourself with makeup?I reinvented myself in October when I left the company. Now, I honestly wear so much less makeup than I normally would have worn. I kind of think I look better. Everyday is different, and it seems like everyday I’m either photographed or on TV, or Facebook Live or something. But normally I’ll do my makeup in the car. I always put moisturizer on, sometimes face oil because my skin is dry. Corrector concealer, mascara, eyebrows, sometimes I do liner. I’ve been skipping foundation though, and just putting blush on.If you could only wear one product, what would it be?I would say it would have to be a pink-y, bronze-y creamy formula that I could put on my lips, my cheeks and my eyes. One of my favorites was a Bobbi Brown cream blush and it was exactly that color. I never liked blushes that were cream-to-powder. I liked full-on cream.But I’ve been using a lot of coconut oil on my skin and I’ve been using a bunch of RMS’ under-the-eyes concealers, and they are really natural looking. I use coconut oil on everything though, I take my makeup off with it at night, then I put more of it on. I use it on my hair, my feet, my everything.You launched your makeup line in 1991 and have worked in beauty for decades. How do you think the concept of beauty as identity has changed over the years?It’s changed immensely. I was a middle schooler going into high school, and if you weren’t Barbie, or Cheryl Tiegs you weren’t considered attractive. With blonde hair and blue eyes — that was it. Then, as I got older, I started to look at some brunettes. Ali MacGraw, she had very strong eyebrows and not a lot of makeup. She was so natural. She was a beauty icon. Then, I moved to New York and girls from all over the world were modeling. The models started looking differently. They were mixed nationality. Things changed. Style has definitely evolved. Girls can walk in with green hair, piercings — it’s honestly about individuality, and I like that.If you started your makeup line today versus in the '90s, would it be different?It would be 100 percent different. It would be a lot smaller. My original idea was to have a really simple line. Because it was so successful, we had many opportunities and requests and it grew really big. It would probably be quite different, if I started today.Do you think it would still revolve around the concept of no-makeup makeup?Well, that's what I wanted it to be, but that’s not really what it ended up being. It was really about individual beauty. I think that when and if I ever go back in the cosmetics industry, it will definitely be my original concept, which is simplifying beauty.Do you think the concept of no-makeup makeup has evolved?I do, I think that a lot of companies and makeup people have “nude” makeup in their line. It’s not nude, it’s like beige, so it kind of takes the color out of people’s skin. So, for me, nude makeup is actually the color of people’s skin, whether you’re African American or you’re white or Asian, you have certain colors in your skin and if you take all the color away, that’s not nude. That’s kind of beige makeup.I think it’s what colors you choose from each line, because we all have different skin colors. We have different skin conditions, so it really just depends. The end result has to look like you’re not wearing a lot of makeup, but just that you’re vibrantly healthy. Hopefully, if you are vibrantly healthy and you take care of yourself, makeup is not that difficult.The YouTube beauty community has really changed the entire landscape of the industry — especially during the past few years. How do you feel about it?I think it’s fascinating, I think it’s interesting, I think some of it is just like a car wreck where you just can’t believe it. There’s some really talented teenagers that are doing these things to themselves. It’s crazy, but I personally like the way they look without makeup better than when they’re all done up. But it’s fascinating to watch. I don’t have that kind of talent, I can’t do that. So, I respect everyone that does.Would you ever start a YouTube channel?I’ve always done videos, both when I was at Bobbi Brown cosmetics and when I was a Yahoo Beauty. I just started doing then again, not tied to a makeup line, and I think it’s definitely a place I want to be. I like to teach.Do you have any favorite YouTubers?Besides Michelle Phan, there’s not one particular one that I watch. I’m much more of an Instagrammer. Beauty is Boring is one of my favorite sites. I actually got to work with her when I was at Yahoo. I’m always reaching out to people I like on Instagram and doing things with them. There’s some really talented people out there.Your own brand has been very inclusive in terms skin tones from the very beginning. How well do you think other brands have progressed in terms of that?I think it’s gotten a lot better. The reason it’s gotten better is a lot of marketing and sales people realize that it’s important to the business. But I think the essence of it is that I don’t want a woman to come up to the counter and not find a color of her, no matter what the range. Whether it’s lips or cheeks. I want the darkest of women to have a foundation that matches their skin.What's the biggest change you'd like to see in the beauty industry?I’m really not feeling contour. I honestly don’t think people need contour, and I think that young girls should feel beautiful as they are without makeup. I’m not saying not to wear makeup, but go both ways. I love the way you look, but I also bet you look great without makeup.I think it’s about being comfortable in your skin.Any makeup look you’ve done on yourself that you regret?So many, and luckily, it washes off. I regret taking my eyebrows off when it was popular and making them very thin, back in the ‘90s. As far as makeup, I look terrible with a red lip. I’ve tried. I don’t look good with a real smoky eye. I’m just someone that looks better with more natural makeup.I think I’ve always been really interested in makeup and what it does though. I was the person who was the only makeup artist in the room who would take a taupe eye pencil and put it on my lips to see what happens to it. I would just try things. I think I was always more of an entrepreneur than a transformer. I wanted to see what it was like. I lined my eyes once with a black mascara. You know what happened?
