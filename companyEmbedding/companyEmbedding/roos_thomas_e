Hexagon is the latest design by Thomas Eurlings for Helderr. The glass tables are available in four sizes. The glass  is coloured through and through which gives it the high clarity and vibrant colours.  Besides the size there is the option for blue-, bronze-, grey- and green-coloured glass.






Marmoleum Modular Diagonal Fade 

Diagonal Fade by Thomas Eurlings consists of a diagonal grid in which different colours have their own section. The colours vary from dark to light, giving an extra touch to the interior. The diagonal lines emphasize this effect further. Colour and shading play a big role in Thomas’ work. These elements are clearly visible in this design. The floor can be ordered at Forbo Flooring.






Tweed plaid 

The plaid is woven in Scotland at a traditionals tweed weaver. Thomas made a contemporary design with the traditional techniques. The plaid is made of 100% virgin wool.
 






Spring Color Tables 

The Spring Color Tables are a set of three coffee tables designed by Thomas Eurlings for the Dutch design label Buhtiq31 in 2013 .

Ovum Mirror 

The Ovum Mirror is an oval shaped mirror which can be mounted on the wall with a leather strap.
The diamond pattern gives the design a three dimensional effect.
Only the diamond shapes have been silver plated so the remaining surface of the glass is transparent.
The mirror is available in blue-, green- and bronze-colored glass.

											Biography							 
Thomas Eurlings (Leiden, The Netherlands, 1983) is a Dutch product and interior designer.
He works as a designer for both his own label Thomas E creations, and renowned flooring manufacturer Forbo.
After graduating from Eindhoven Design Academy in 2006, Thomas worked for influential names in the fashion and textile industry such as Alexander van Slobbe (orson+bodil) and Ulf Moritz (Sahco).
In his work, Thomas examines the traditional borders between form and function.
Clear, recognizable icons and forms make his work seemingly accessible.
But in order to discover their essence, the observer has to look closer at the products and use his or her imagination. Recurring themes are the paradoxes of functional decoration and industrial originality.
Thomas lives and works in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
