About AeroVironment, Inc. | UAS & EV Solutions Since 1971












































































About Us
Since AeroVironment's beginnings more than 40 years ago, our scientists and engineers have sought innovative solutions to many of our most difficult security, energy and infrastructure management challenges. But as remarkable as our products are, it's the actionable intelligence they provide our customers that most clearly defines our company. From the moment we developed our breakthrough unmanned aircraft systems, we understood their primary benefit—giving people the ability to see the situation ahead. With AeroVironment's sophisticated eyes in the sky, we could provide life-saving intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance for our troops on the battlefield. Today, AeroVironment has become the acknowledged expert and largest supplier of small, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to the Pentagon and to dozens of allied nations. As effective as our small UAS have become on the battlefront, they promise to be equally life-saving on the home front. AeroVironment's family of integrated and interoperable UAS also gives law enforcement personnel and first responders the ability to see and assess the situation ahead. While AeroVironment's information solutions will significantly change the way farmers and energy providers monitor and manage their assets. Although the AeroVironment story began in the air, early on we also understood the impact our energy technologies could have on the ground—leading to our role in the development of the GM Impact, the prototype for the world's first commercially produced electric vehicle. Since then, our EV test systems and charging solutions have fast become the intelligent choice for electric vehicle manufacturers, fleet managers and drivers, paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable world.

Why Level 2?



 

Level 2 chargers allow you to charge your electric car in just a few hours while you sleep, work, enjoy a meal, or spend time with your family. A level 2 charger safely delivers AC power to your electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid so you’re always “fueled up” and ready to go.

Charge nearly 3 to 5 times faster than a level 1 cordset and get more miles in less time.
Reliable, safe, convenient, and energy efficient charging
Save money by charging your EV during off-peak times

Different L2 Options



 

Level 2 charging refers to the voltage that the electric vehicle charger uses (240 volts). Level 2 chargers come in a variety of amperages typically ranging from 16 amps to 40 amps. The two most common Level 2 chargers are 16 and 30 amps, which also may be referred to as 3.3 kW and 7.2 kW respectively. These two amperages are the most common because they match the onboard charger (OBC) on many of the current electric vehicles.

Depending on the amperages, the difference between Level 2 chargers could be significant in charging times. Compare charging times with our Time To Charge Guide.
Explore your options for both 16 and 30 amp chargers in our online store.

What People Say







WOW!!! I ordered the 120/220 Dual charger and installed it per the recommended installation without a hitch. I really want to point out that most if not all other home chargers require a minimum 30 to 50 Amp breaker. AV's solution works on a 20 Amp circuit just fine. I am the owner of a 2014 Ford C-Max Energi and with the AV Turbocord I am able to get a full charge in 2 hours, That is awesome!!!! Great product and great service! So for all of you skeptics out there, this little portable charger works just as well as the permanently mounted home chargers, so get yours today!!!
Benjamin A. Aronsonaronsontech.com







The electric charging station is the newest component of our green initiative program, and I’m especially excited about it because we are able to serve the needs of the community. More and more every day we see EV’s coming here to charge.  I had the opportunity to speak with about a half a dozen charging station manufacturers and AV stood out from all the rest.  Aerovironment was very helpful in making sure that we chose the right location and that we had access to the power supply to facilitate the charger.  At the end of the day after every other company I spoke with I didn’t feel like it was a hard decision at all to go with AeroVironment.
Julie LabinDirector of Sustainability for the Malibu Country Mart & Cost Real Estate Investments







Excellent product [Nissan RS 30A]. Placed the order over the phone, received the product in 24 hrs. Excellent customer service from George (sales associate) pre and post sales. Very easy to install comes with the wall plate. Spectacular performance. Overall highly recommended. Above all neighbors’ envy and owner's pride.

AeroVironment, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter And Full Year Results






Business Wire




Jun 27, 2017 4:10 PM EDT













 


















































  AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended April 30, 2017.  "Through the successful execution of our strategic plan, AeroVironment achieved record performance in our fourth quarter, with revenue of $125 million and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.30," said Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment president and chief executive officer. "International demand for our Family of small unmanned aircraft systems and domestic demand for our Family of Tactical Missile Systems drove full year revenue to $264.9 million, within our guidance range, and fully diluted earnings per share to $0.54, significantly above guidance and 38 percent higher than last year. Our team executed our fiscal 2017 plan effectively, growing year-end funded backlog by 19 percent over the previous year to $78 million, while creating value for our customers, employees and stockholders and positioning AeroVironment for long-term growth."  FISCAL 2017 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS  Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $125.4 million, an increase of 48% from fourth quarter fiscal 2016 revenue of $84.8 million. The increase in revenue resulted from an increase in sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $39.8 million and an increase in sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $0.8 million.  Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $58.7 million, an increase from fourth quarter fiscal 2016 gross margin of $37.9 million. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in product margin of $26.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in service margin of $5.8 million. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin increased to 47% from 45%. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of product sales to total revenue.  Income from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $34.0 million compared to fourth quarter fiscal 2016 income from operations of $6.8 million. The increase in the year over year income from operations was primarily a result of an increase in gross margin of $20.7 million and a decrease in research and development (R&D) expense of $6.4 million.

AeroVironment, Inc. is an American technology company in Monrovia, California, and Simi Valley, California, that is primarily involved in energy systems, electric vehicle systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a designer of human-powered aircraft, founded the company in 1971. The company is probably most well known for developing a series of lightweight human-powered and then solar-powered vehicles. AeroVironment is the Pentagon's top supplier of small drones — including the Raven, Wasp and Puma models. They have signed a strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp to develop their 'Global Observer' to provide "persistent airborne observation".[2]

Vehicles developed[edit]
Among the vehicles the company built are:

Gossamer Condor - The first successful human-powered airplane. The Gossamer Condor is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, since it won the first Kremer Prize in 1977.
Gossamer Albatross - In 1979 this human-powered plane flew 23 miles (37 km) across the English Channel and claimed the largest prize in aviation history. Another of these planes is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum.
Gossamer Penguin - A solar-powered variant of the Gossamer Albatross.
Solar Challenger - This plane flew 163 miles (262 km) from Paris France to England on solar power.
High Altitude Solar (HALSOL)-This solar-powered unmanned aircraft was sponsored by the CIA in the 1980s as the first unmanned solar-powered aircraft in history prototyped for national security missions. It was declassified and transferred to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in 1993 where it was modified as a high altitude, long endurance (HALE) UAV technology demonstrator capable of becoming weaponized to destroy theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase of flight (called Boost Phase Intercept). Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was the executing agent for the BMDO program. Dr. Nick Colella and Dr. Lowell Wood led the LLNL efforts for the BMDO program manager, LtCol (USAF) Dale Tietz. Ray Morgan led the program in AeroVironment alongside Dr. Paul MacCready and Tim Conver. This was a fast-paced demo program supported at the highest levels of government. The ultimate goal was to develop the world's first "fly forever" HALE UAV that could be configured for a variety of national security missions. The program was cancelled in 1995 due to budget reductions in the Clinton Administration at which time the aircraft, called Pathfinder, was transferred to NASA for a new program. Pathfinder flew several flight test missions at NASAs Dryden Flight Research Center before the property transfer occurred. BMDO and LLNL also started initial development of new, ultra-lightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from Pathfinder and its derivatives. The interceptor, called Astrid, flew several successful missions during this time period at Vandenberg AFB, CA.
NASA Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus - This unmanned plane, built by AeroVironment as a part of the NASA ERAST Program, demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power. After initial successes, the Pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger Pathfinder Plus, which is also on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[3] Dale Tietz from the Pentagon's BMDO program transferred the Pathfinder aircraft to NASA for the ERAST Program, where AeroVironment managed its development as a non-weaponized variant.
NASA Centurion - The Centurion was an expansion of the Pathfinder concept, designed to achieve the ERAST Program goal of sustained flight at 100,000 feet (30,000 m) altitude.[3]
NASA Helios Prototype - Derived from the Centurion, this solar cell and fuel cell powered UAV set a world record for flight at 96,863 feet (29,524 m). It was intended to be the prototype for the production Helios aircraft, envisioned as an "atmospheric satellite". The ERAST program was terminated in 2003, and as of 2008 Helios has not entered production.[3] In actuality, it has been reborn in the form of the Global Observer UAS, currently in development under a Joint Concept Technology Demonstration led by USSOCOM.[4] The key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power.
AeroVironment Global Observer - The Los Angeles Times reported first flight of Global Observer happening at the Mojave Desert in the first week of January, 2011.[5] Global Observer is powered from hydrogen, appears to have 4 motors with twin-bladed props, has a 175-foot (53 m) wingspan, 65,000-foot (20,000 m) maximum altitude, airspeed greater than 120 mph (190 km/h), and 5 to 7 day maximum flight duration.[6]
Sunraycer - This solar-powered car won the first world's first solar car race in Australia in 1987. The next fastest car finished two days after the Sunraycer. This car is at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
GM Impact - This was an electric car, developed as a serious prototype for a mass-production consumer car.
AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven - a small military UAV. It is hand launched with a wingspan of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) and a weight of 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), providing color and infrared video to its handheld ground control as well as remote viewing stations. Over 9,000 Ravens have been delivered or are on order as of June 2008.
AeroVironment Wasp III - a miniature, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 3.1 miles (5.0 km). In 2007, the Wasp was selected by the US Air Force as the choice for their BATMAV Program.[7] As of 2008, over 1,000 Wasp aircraft have been delivered to customers worldwide.
AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - a small lightweight, battery powered, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 6.2 miles (10.0 km). Puma's avionics enable autonomous flight and precise GPS navigation. It was originally designed to demonstrate advanced propulsion technologies for such aircraft. It flew in June 2007 for five hours[8] powered by an onboard "fuel cell battery hybrid energy storage system." Another attempt in November 2007 saw a flight time greater than seven hours.[9] These experimental flights integrated ProCore fuel cell from Protonex Technology Corporation[10] and hydrogen generation technology from Millennium Cell, Inc. On July 2, 2008, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma AE variant as its All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) solution.
AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird - Announced in 2011, a hummingbird look-alike drone equipped with a camera, can fly at speeds of up to 11 miles (18 km) per hour. It can climb and descend vertically, fly sideways, forward and backward, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise by remote control for about eight minutes.
AeroVironment SkyTote - a VTOL-fixed wing hybrid UAV, which has attained the advantages of both plane designs (respectively VTOL takeoff capability and decreased energy usage).
Aerovironment Switchblade - A miniature, electrically powered, armed unmanned drone kamikaze weapon, for use by deployed military troops in the field.[11]
AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer
AeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye
AeroVironment Snipe - Informed by the Nano Hummingbird, a small quadrotor design small enough to be deployed by an individual to collect surveillance information. It weighs 5 oz (0.14 kg), can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a range of more than 0.6 mi (0.97 km), employs rechargeable batteries to fly for 15 minutes, can withstand winds of 15 mph (24 km/h), and is equipped with EO/IR, low light-capable and long-wave infrared sensors to take photos or video in day or night conditions. In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

Electric vehicle charging stations[edit]
AeroVironment offers a 240V home-charging station for electric vehicles. It is compatible with the SAE J1772 standard for level 2 charging.[19] Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply this home charging station and installation services for the Nissan Leaf electric car.[20] AeroVironment also sells level 3 high-voltage DC fast-charge stations compatible with the CHAdeMO standard that can charge a Think electric car to 80% in 15 minutes.[21]
AeroVironment participates in various government and industry initiatives to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.[21][22]
AeroVironment also sells the PosiCharge line of industrial electric vehicle charging systems for forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Pathfinder Plus in flight over Hawaii, June 2002, equipped with Skytower communications equipment


AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

AeroVironment, Inc. is an American technology company in Monrovia, California, and Simi Valley, California, that is primarily involved in energy systems, electric vehicle systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a designer of human-powered aircraft, founded the company in 1971. The company is probably most well known for developing a series of lightweight human-powered and then solar-powered vehicles. AeroVironment is the Pentagon's top supplier of small drones — including the Raven, Wasp and Puma models. They have signed a strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp to develop their 'Global Observer' to provide "persistent airborne observation".[2]

Vehicles developed[edit]
Among the vehicles the company built are:

Gossamer Condor - The first successful human-powered airplane. The Gossamer Condor is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, since it won the first Kremer Prize in 1977.
Gossamer Albatross - In 1979 this human-powered plane flew 23 miles (37 km) across the English Channel and claimed the largest prize in aviation history. Another of these planes is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum.
Gossamer Penguin - A solar-powered variant of the Gossamer Albatross.
Solar Challenger - This plane flew 163 miles (262 km) from Paris France to England on solar power.
High Altitude Solar (HALSOL)-This solar-powered unmanned aircraft was sponsored by the CIA in the 1980s as the first unmanned solar-powered aircraft in history prototyped for national security missions. It was declassified and transferred to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in 1993 where it was modified as a high altitude, long endurance (HALE) UAV technology demonstrator capable of becoming weaponized to destroy theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase of flight (called Boost Phase Intercept). Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was the executing agent for the BMDO program. Dr. Nick Colella and Dr. Lowell Wood led the LLNL efforts for the BMDO program manager, LtCol (USAF) Dale Tietz. Ray Morgan led the program in AeroVironment alongside Dr. Paul MacCready and Tim Conver. This was a fast-paced demo program supported at the highest levels of government. The ultimate goal was to develop the world's first "fly forever" HALE UAV that could be configured for a variety of national security missions. The program was cancelled in 1995 due to budget reductions in the Clinton Administration at which time the aircraft, called Pathfinder, was transferred to NASA for a new program. Pathfinder flew several flight test missions at NASAs Dryden Flight Research Center before the property transfer occurred. BMDO and LLNL also started initial development of new, ultra-lightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from Pathfinder and its derivatives. The interceptor, called Astrid, flew several successful missions during this time period at Vandenberg AFB, CA.
NASA Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus - This unmanned plane, built by AeroVironment as a part of the NASA ERAST Program, demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power. After initial successes, the Pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger Pathfinder Plus, which is also on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[3] Dale Tietz from the Pentagon's BMDO program transferred the Pathfinder aircraft to NASA for the ERAST Program, where AeroVironment managed its development as a non-weaponized variant.
NASA Centurion - The Centurion was an expansion of the Pathfinder concept, designed to achieve the ERAST Program goal of sustained flight at 100,000 feet (30,000 m) altitude.[3]
NASA Helios Prototype - Derived from the Centurion, this solar cell and fuel cell powered UAV set a world record for flight at 96,863 feet (29,524 m). It was intended to be the prototype for the production Helios aircraft, envisioned as an "atmospheric satellite". The ERAST program was terminated in 2003, and as of 2008 Helios has not entered production.[3] In actuality, it has been reborn in the form of the Global Observer UAS, currently in development under a Joint Concept Technology Demonstration led by USSOCOM.[4] The key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power.
AeroVironment Global Observer - The Los Angeles Times reported first flight of Global Observer happening at the Mojave Desert in the first week of January, 2011.[5] Global Observer is powered from hydrogen, appears to have 4 motors with twin-bladed props, has a 175-foot (53 m) wingspan, 65,000-foot (20,000 m) maximum altitude, airspeed greater than 120 mph (190 km/h), and 5 to 7 day maximum flight duration.[6]
Sunraycer - This solar-powered car won the first world's first solar car race in Australia in 1987. The next fastest car finished two days after the Sunraycer. This car is at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
GM Impact - This was an electric car, developed as a serious prototype for a mass-production consumer car.
AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven - a small military UAV. It is hand launched with a wingspan of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) and a weight of 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), providing color and infrared video to its handheld ground control as well as remote viewing stations. Over 9,000 Ravens have been delivered or are on order as of June 2008.
AeroVironment Wasp III - a miniature, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 3.1 miles (5.0 km). In 2007, the Wasp was selected by the US Air Force as the choice for their BATMAV Program.[7] As of 2008, over 1,000 Wasp aircraft have been delivered to customers worldwide.
AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - a small lightweight, battery powered, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 6.2 miles (10.0 km). Puma's avionics enable autonomous flight and precise GPS navigation. It was originally designed to demonstrate advanced propulsion technologies for such aircraft. It flew in June 2007 for five hours[8] powered by an onboard "fuel cell battery hybrid energy storage system." Another attempt in November 2007 saw a flight time greater than seven hours.[9] These experimental flights integrated ProCore fuel cell from Protonex Technology Corporation[10] and hydrogen generation technology from Millennium Cell, Inc. On July 2, 2008, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma AE variant as its All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) solution.
AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird - Announced in 2011, a hummingbird look-alike drone equipped with a camera, can fly at speeds of up to 11 miles (18 km) per hour. It can climb and descend vertically, fly sideways, forward and backward, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise by remote control for about eight minutes.
AeroVironment SkyTote - a VTOL-fixed wing hybrid UAV, which has attained the advantages of both plane designs (respectively VTOL takeoff capability and decreased energy usage).
Aerovironment Switchblade - A miniature, electrically powered, armed unmanned drone kamikaze weapon, for use by deployed military troops in the field.[11]
AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer
AeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye
AeroVironment Snipe - Informed by the Nano Hummingbird, a small quadrotor design small enough to be deployed by an individual to collect surveillance information. It weighs 5 oz (0.14 kg), can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a range of more than 0.6 mi (0.97 km), employs rechargeable batteries to fly for 15 minutes, can withstand winds of 15 mph (24 km/h), and is equipped with EO/IR, low light-capable and long-wave infrared sensors to take photos or video in day or night conditions. In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

Electric vehicle charging stations[edit]
AeroVironment offers a 240V home-charging station for electric vehicles. It is compatible with the SAE J1772 standard for level 2 charging.[19] Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply this home charging station and installation services for the Nissan Leaf electric car.[20] AeroVironment also sells level 3 high-voltage DC fast-charge stations compatible with the CHAdeMO standard that can charge a Think electric car to 80% in 15 minutes.[21]
AeroVironment participates in various government and industry initiatives to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.[21][22]
AeroVironment also sells the PosiCharge line of industrial electric vehicle charging systems for forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Pathfinder Plus in flight over Hawaii, June 2002, equipped with Skytower communications equipment


AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

AeroVironment, Inc. is an American technology company in Monrovia, California, and Simi Valley, California, that is primarily involved in energy systems, electric vehicle systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a designer of human-powered aircraft, founded the company in 1971. The company is probably most well known for developing a series of lightweight human-powered and then solar-powered vehicles. AeroVironment is the Pentagon's top supplier of small drones — including the Raven, Wasp and Puma models. They have signed a strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp to develop their 'Global Observer' to provide "persistent airborne observation".[2]

Vehicles developed[edit]
Among the vehicles the company built are:

Gossamer Condor - The first successful human-powered airplane. The Gossamer Condor is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, since it won the first Kremer Prize in 1977.
Gossamer Albatross - In 1979 this human-powered plane flew 23 miles (37 km) across the English Channel and claimed the largest prize in aviation history. Another of these planes is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum.
Gossamer Penguin - A solar-powered variant of the Gossamer Albatross.
Solar Challenger - This plane flew 163 miles (262 km) from Paris France to England on solar power.
High Altitude Solar (HALSOL)-This solar-powered unmanned aircraft was sponsored by the CIA in the 1980s as the first unmanned solar-powered aircraft in history prototyped for national security missions. It was declassified and transferred to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in 1993 where it was modified as a high altitude, long endurance (HALE) UAV technology demonstrator capable of becoming weaponized to destroy theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase of flight (called Boost Phase Intercept). Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was the executing agent for the BMDO program. Dr. Nick Colella and Dr. Lowell Wood led the LLNL efforts for the BMDO program manager, LtCol (USAF) Dale Tietz. Ray Morgan led the program in AeroVironment alongside Dr. Paul MacCready and Tim Conver. This was a fast-paced demo program supported at the highest levels of government. The ultimate goal was to develop the world's first "fly forever" HALE UAV that could be configured for a variety of national security missions. The program was cancelled in 1995 due to budget reductions in the Clinton Administration at which time the aircraft, called Pathfinder, was transferred to NASA for a new program. Pathfinder flew several flight test missions at NASAs Dryden Flight Research Center before the property transfer occurred. BMDO and LLNL also started initial development of new, ultra-lightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from Pathfinder and its derivatives. The interceptor, called Astrid, flew several successful missions during this time period at Vandenberg AFB, CA.
NASA Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus - This unmanned plane, built by AeroVironment as a part of the NASA ERAST Program, demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power. After initial successes, the Pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger Pathfinder Plus, which is also on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[3] Dale Tietz from the Pentagon's BMDO program transferred the Pathfinder aircraft to NASA for the ERAST Program, where AeroVironment managed its development as a non-weaponized variant.
NASA Centurion - The Centurion was an expansion of the Pathfinder concept, designed to achieve the ERAST Program goal of sustained flight at 100,000 feet (30,000 m) altitude.[3]
NASA Helios Prototype - Derived from the Centurion, this solar cell and fuel cell powered UAV set a world record for flight at 96,863 feet (29,524 m). It was intended to be the prototype for the production Helios aircraft, envisioned as an "atmospheric satellite". The ERAST program was terminated in 2003, and as of 2008 Helios has not entered production.[3] In actuality, it has been reborn in the form of the Global Observer UAS, currently in development under a Joint Concept Technology Demonstration led by USSOCOM.[4] The key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power.
AeroVironment Global Observer - The Los Angeles Times reported first flight of Global Observer happening at the Mojave Desert in the first week of January, 2011.[5] Global Observer is powered from hydrogen, appears to have 4 motors with twin-bladed props, has a 175-foot (53 m) wingspan, 65,000-foot (20,000 m) maximum altitude, airspeed greater than 120 mph (190 km/h), and 5 to 7 day maximum flight duration.[6]
Sunraycer - This solar-powered car won the first world's first solar car race in Australia in 1987. The next fastest car finished two days after the Sunraycer. This car is at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
GM Impact - This was an electric car, developed as a serious prototype for a mass-production consumer car.
AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven - a small military UAV. It is hand launched with a wingspan of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) and a weight of 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), providing color and infrared video to its handheld ground control as well as remote viewing stations. Over 9,000 Ravens have been delivered or are on order as of June 2008.
AeroVironment Wasp III - a miniature, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 3.1 miles (5.0 km). In 2007, the Wasp was selected by the US Air Force as the choice for their BATMAV Program.[7] As of 2008, over 1,000 Wasp aircraft have been delivered to customers worldwide.
AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - a small lightweight, battery powered, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 6.2 miles (10.0 km). Puma's avionics enable autonomous flight and precise GPS navigation. It was originally designed to demonstrate advanced propulsion technologies for such aircraft. It flew in June 2007 for five hours[8] powered by an onboard "fuel cell battery hybrid energy storage system." Another attempt in November 2007 saw a flight time greater than seven hours.[9] These experimental flights integrated ProCore fuel cell from Protonex Technology Corporation[10] and hydrogen generation technology from Millennium Cell, Inc. On July 2, 2008, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma AE variant as its All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) solution.
AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird - Announced in 2011, a hummingbird look-alike drone equipped with a camera, can fly at speeds of up to 11 miles (18 km) per hour. It can climb and descend vertically, fly sideways, forward and backward, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise by remote control for about eight minutes.
AeroVironment SkyTote - a VTOL-fixed wing hybrid UAV, which has attained the advantages of both plane designs (respectively VTOL takeoff capability and decreased energy usage).
Aerovironment Switchblade - A miniature, electrically powered, armed unmanned drone kamikaze weapon, for use by deployed military troops in the field.[11]
AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer
AeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye
AeroVironment Snipe - Informed by the Nano Hummingbird, a small quadrotor design small enough to be deployed by an individual to collect surveillance information. It weighs 5 oz (0.14 kg), can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a range of more than 0.6 mi (0.97 km), employs rechargeable batteries to fly for 15 minutes, can withstand winds of 15 mph (24 km/h), and is equipped with EO/IR, low light-capable and long-wave infrared sensors to take photos or video in day or night conditions. In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

Electric vehicle charging stations[edit]
AeroVironment offers a 240V home-charging station for electric vehicles. It is compatible with the SAE J1772 standard for level 2 charging.[19] Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply this home charging station and installation services for the Nissan Leaf electric car.[20] AeroVironment also sells level 3 high-voltage DC fast-charge stations compatible with the CHAdeMO standard that can charge a Think electric car to 80% in 15 minutes.[21]
AeroVironment participates in various government and industry initiatives to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.[21][22]
AeroVironment also sells the PosiCharge line of industrial electric vehicle charging systems for forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.

AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

The ultimate goal was to develop the world's first "fly forever" HALE UAV that could be configured for a variety of national security missions. The program was cancelled in 1995 due to budget reductions in the Clinton Administration at which time the aircraft, called Pathfinder, was transferred to NASA for a new program. Pathfinder flew several flight test missions at NASAs Dryden Flight Research Center before the property transfer occurred. BMDO and LLNL also started initial development of new, ultra-lightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from Pathfinder and its derivatives. The interceptor, called Astrid, flew several successful missions during this time period at Vandenberg AFB, CA.
NASA Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus - This unmanned plane, built by AeroVironment as a part of the NASA ERAST Program, demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power. After initial successes, the Pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger Pathfinder Plus, which is also on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[3] Dale Tietz from the Pentagon's BMDO program transferred the Pathfinder aircraft to NASA for the ERAST Program, where AeroVironment managed its development as a non-weaponized variant.
NASA Centurion - The Centurion was an expansion of the Pathfinder concept, designed to achieve the ERAST Program goal of sustained flight at 100,000 feet (30,000 m) altitude.[3]
NASA Helios Prototype - Derived from the Centurion, this solar cell and fuel cell powered UAV set a world record for flight at 96,863 feet (29,524 m). It was intended to be the prototype for the production Helios aircraft, envisioned as an "atmospheric satellite". The ERAST program was terminated in 2003, and as of 2008 Helios has not entered production.[3] In actuality, it has been reborn in the form of the Global Observer UAS, currently in development under a Joint Concept Technology Demonstration led by USSOCOM.[4] The key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power.
AeroVironment Global Observer - The Los Angeles Times reported first flight of Global Observer happening at the Mojave Desert in the first week of January, 2011.[5] Global Observer is powered from hydrogen, appears to have 4 motors with twin-bladed props, has a 175-foot (53 m) wingspan, 65,000-foot (20,000 m) maximum altitude, airspeed greater than 120 mph (190 km/h), and 5 to 7 day maximum flight duration.[6]
Sunraycer - This solar-powered car won the first world's first solar car race in Australia in 1987. The next fastest car finished two days after the Sunraycer. This car is at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
GM Impact - This was an electric car, developed as a serious prototype for a mass-production consumer car.
AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven - a small military UAV. It is hand launched with a wingspan of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) and a weight of 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), providing color and infrared video to its handheld ground control as well as remote viewing stations. Over 9,000 Ravens have been delivered or are on order as of June 2008.
AeroVironment Wasp III - a miniature, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 3.1 miles (5.0 km). In 2007, the Wasp was selected by the US Air Force as the choice for their BATMAV Program.[7] As of 2008, over 1,000 Wasp aircraft have been delivered to customers worldwide.
AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - a small lightweight, battery powered, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 6.2 miles (10.0 km). Puma's avionics enable autonomous flight and precise GPS navigation. It was originally designed to demonstrate advanced propulsion technologies for such aircraft. It flew in June 2007 for five hours[8] powered by an onboard "fuel cell battery hybrid energy storage system." Another attempt in November 2007 saw a flight time greater than seven hours.[9] These experimental flights integrated ProCore fuel cell from Protonex Technology Corporation[10] and hydrogen generation technology from Millennium Cell, Inc. On July 2, 2008, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma AE variant as its All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) solution.
AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird - Announced in 2011, a hummingbird look-alike drone equipped with a camera, can fly at speeds of up to 11 miles (18 km) per hour. It can climb and descend vertically, fly sideways, forward and backward, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise by remote control for about eight minutes.
AeroVironment SkyTote - a VTOL-fixed wing hybrid UAV, which has attained the advantages of both plane designs (respectively VTOL takeoff capability and decreased energy usage).
Aerovironment Switchblade - A miniature, electrically powered, armed unmanned drone kamikaze weapon, for use by deployed military troops in the field.[11]
AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer
AeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye
AeroVironment Snipe - Informed by the Nano Hummingbird, a small quadrotor design small enough to be deployed by an individual to collect surveillance information. It weighs 5 oz (0.14 kg), can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a range of more than 0.6 mi (0.97 km), employs rechargeable batteries to fly for 15 minutes, can withstand winds of 15 mph (24 km/h), and is equipped with EO/IR, low light-capable and long-wave infrared sensors to take photos or video in day or night conditions. In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

Electric vehicle charging stations[edit]
AeroVironment offers a 240V home-charging station for electric vehicles. It is compatible with the SAE J1772 standard for level 2 charging.[19] Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply this home charging station and installation services for the Nissan Leaf electric car.[20] AeroVironment also sells level 3 high-voltage DC fast-charge stations compatible with the CHAdeMO standard that can charge a Think electric car to 80% in 15 minutes.[21]
AeroVironment participates in various government and industry initiatives to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.[21][22]
AeroVironment also sells the PosiCharge line of industrial electric vehicle charging systems for forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Pathfinder Plus in flight over Hawaii, June 2002, equipped with Skytower communications equipment


AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

Vehicles developed[edit]
Among the vehicles the company built are:

Gossamer Condor - The first successful human-powered airplane. The Gossamer Condor is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, since it won the first Kremer Prize in 1977.
Gossamer Albatross - In 1979 this human-powered plane flew 23 miles (37 km) across the English Channel and claimed the largest prize in aviation history. Another of these planes is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum.
Gossamer Penguin - A solar-powered variant of the Gossamer Albatross.
Solar Challenger - This plane flew 163 miles (262 km) from Paris France to England on solar power.
High Altitude Solar (HALSOL)-This solar-powered unmanned aircraft was sponsored by the CIA in the 1980s as the first unmanned solar-powered aircraft in history prototyped for national security missions. It was declassified and transferred to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in 1993 where it was modified as a high altitude, long endurance (HALE) UAV technology demonstrator capable of becoming weaponized to destroy theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase of flight (called Boost Phase Intercept). Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was the executing agent for the BMDO program. Dr. Nick Colella and Dr. Lowell Wood led the LLNL efforts for the BMDO program manager, LtCol (USAF) Dale Tietz. Ray Morgan led the program in AeroVironment alongside Dr. Paul MacCready and Tim Conver. This was a fast-paced demo program supported at the highest levels of government. The ultimate goal was to develop the world's first "fly forever" HALE UAV that could be configured for a variety of national security missions. The program was cancelled in 1995 due to budget reductions in the Clinton Administration at which time the aircraft, called Pathfinder, was transferred to NASA for a new program. Pathfinder flew several flight test missions at NASAs Dryden Flight Research Center before the property transfer occurred. BMDO and LLNL also started initial development of new, ultra-lightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from Pathfinder and its derivatives. The interceptor, called Astrid, flew several successful missions during this time period at Vandenberg AFB, CA.
NASA Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus - This unmanned plane, built by AeroVironment as a part of the NASA ERAST Program, demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power. After initial successes, the Pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger Pathfinder Plus, which is also on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[3] Dale Tietz from the Pentagon's BMDO program transferred the Pathfinder aircraft to NASA for the ERAST Program, where AeroVironment managed its development as a non-weaponized variant.
NASA Centurion - The Centurion was an expansion of the Pathfinder concept, designed to achieve the ERAST Program goal of sustained flight at 100,000 feet (30,000 m) altitude.[3]
NASA Helios Prototype - Derived from the Centurion, this solar cell and fuel cell powered UAV set a world record for flight at 96,863 feet (29,524 m). It was intended to be the prototype for the production Helios aircraft, envisioned as an "atmospheric satellite". The ERAST program was terminated in 2003, and as of 2008 Helios has not entered production.[3] In actuality, it has been reborn in the form of the Global Observer UAS, currently in development under a Joint Concept Technology Demonstration led by USSOCOM.[4] The key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power.
AeroVironment Global Observer - The Los Angeles Times reported first flight of Global Observer happening at the Mojave Desert in the first week of January, 2011.[5] Global Observer is powered from hydrogen, appears to have 4 motors with twin-bladed props, has a 175-foot (53 m) wingspan, 65,000-foot (20,000 m) maximum altitude, airspeed greater than 120 mph (190 km/h), and 5 to 7 day maximum flight duration.[6]
Sunraycer - This solar-powered car won the first world's first solar car race in Australia in 1987. The next fastest car finished two days after the Sunraycer. This car is at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
GM Impact - This was an electric car, developed as a serious prototype for a mass-production consumer car.
AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven - a small military UAV. It is hand launched with a wingspan of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) and a weight of 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), providing color and infrared video to its handheld ground control as well as remote viewing stations. Over 9,000 Ravens have been delivered or are on order as of June 2008.
AeroVironment Wasp III - a miniature, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 3.1 miles (5.0 km). In 2007, the Wasp was selected by the US Air Force as the choice for their BATMAV Program.[7] As of 2008, over 1,000 Wasp aircraft have been delivered to customers worldwide.
AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - a small lightweight, battery powered, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 6.2 miles (10.0 km). Puma's avionics enable autonomous flight and precise GPS navigation. It was originally designed to demonstrate advanced propulsion technologies for such aircraft. It flew in June 2007 for five hours[8] powered by an onboard "fuel cell battery hybrid energy storage system." Another attempt in November 2007 saw a flight time greater than seven hours.[9] These experimental flights integrated ProCore fuel cell from Protonex Technology Corporation[10] and hydrogen generation technology from Millennium Cell, Inc. On July 2, 2008, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma AE variant as its All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) solution.
AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird - Announced in 2011, a hummingbird look-alike drone equipped with a camera, can fly at speeds of up to 11 miles (18 km) per hour. It can climb and descend vertically, fly sideways, forward and backward, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise by remote control for about eight minutes.
AeroVironment SkyTote - a VTOL-fixed wing hybrid UAV, which has attained the advantages of both plane designs (respectively VTOL takeoff capability and decreased energy usage).
Aerovironment Switchblade - A miniature, electrically powered, armed unmanned drone kamikaze weapon, for use by deployed military troops in the field.[11]
AeroVironment FQM-151 Pointer
AeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye
AeroVironment Snipe - Informed by the Nano Hummingbird, a small quadrotor design small enough to be deployed by an individual to collect surveillance information. It weighs 5 oz (0.14 kg), can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a range of more than 0.6 mi (0.97 km), employs rechargeable batteries to fly for 15 minutes, can withstand winds of 15 mph (24 km/h), and is equipped with EO/IR, low light-capable and long-wave infrared sensors to take photos or video in day or night conditions. In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

Electric vehicle charging stations[edit]
AeroVironment offers a 240V home-charging station for electric vehicles. It is compatible with the SAE J1772 standard for level 2 charging.[19] Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply this home charging station and installation services for the Nissan Leaf electric car.[20] AeroVironment also sells level 3 high-voltage DC fast-charge stations compatible with the CHAdeMO standard that can charge a Think electric car to 80% in 15 minutes.[21]
AeroVironment participates in various government and industry initiatives to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.[21][22]
AeroVironment also sells the PosiCharge line of industrial electric vehicle charging systems for forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Pathfinder Plus in flight over Hawaii, June 2002, equipped with Skytower communications equipment


AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

Electric vehicle charging stations[edit]
AeroVironment offers a 240V home-charging station for electric vehicles. It is compatible with the SAE J1772 standard for level 2 charging.[19] Nissan selected AeroVironment to supply this home charging station and installation services for the Nissan Leaf electric car.[20] AeroVironment also sells level 3 high-voltage DC fast-charge stations compatible with the CHAdeMO standard that can charge a Think electric car to 80% in 15 minutes.[21]
AeroVironment participates in various government and industry initiatives to create an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.[21][22]
AeroVironment also sells the PosiCharge line of industrial electric vehicle charging systems for forklifts and other warehouse vehicles.
Subsidiaries[edit]




Pathfinder Plus in flight over Hawaii, June 2002, equipped with Skytower communications equipment


AeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as "atmospheric satellites", or high altitude communications relay platforms.[23]
In July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an "atmospheric satellite" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from 65,000 feet (20,000 m), giving the aircraft the equivalence of a 12 miles (19 km) tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal.[24] According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, "SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay." Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. "A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis."[25]

AeroVironment, Inc. is an American technology company in Monrovia, California, and Simi Valley, California, that is primarily involved in energy systems, electric vehicle systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a designer of human-powered aircraft, founded the company in 1971. The company is probably most well known for developing a series of lightweight human-powered and then solar-powered vehicles. AeroVironment is the Pentagon's top supplier of small drones — including the Raven, Wasp and Puma models. They have signed a strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp to develop their 'Global Observer' to provide "persistent airborne observation".[2]

Vehicles developed[edit]
Among the vehicles the company built are:

Gossamer Condor - The first successful human-powered airplane. The Gossamer Condor is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, since it won the first Kremer Prize in 1977.
Gossamer Albatross - In 1979 this human-powered plane flew 23 miles (37 km) across the English Channel and claimed the largest prize in aviation history. Another of these planes is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum.
Gossamer Penguin - A solar-powered variant of the Gossamer Albatross.
Solar Challenger - This plane flew 163 miles (262 km) from Paris France to England on solar power.
High Altitude Solar (HALSOL)-This solar-powered unmanned aircraft was sponsored by the CIA in the 1980s as the first unmanned solar-powered aircraft in history prototyped for national security missions. It was declassified and transferred to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in 1993 where it was modified as a high altitude, long endurance (HALE) UAV technology demonstrator capable of becoming weaponized to destroy theater ballistic missiles in the boost phase of flight (called Boost Phase Intercept). Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was the executing agent for the BMDO program. Dr. Nick Colella and Dr. Lowell Wood led the LLNL efforts for the BMDO program manager, LtCol (USAF) Dale Tietz. Ray Morgan led the program in AeroVironment alongside Dr. Paul MacCready and Tim Conver. This was a fast-paced demo program supported at the highest levels of government. The ultimate goal was to develop the world's first "fly forever" HALE UAV that could be configured for a variety of national security missions. The program was cancelled in 1995 due to budget reductions in the Clinton Administration at which time the aircraft, called Pathfinder, was transferred to NASA for a new program. Pathfinder flew several flight test missions at NASAs Dryden Flight Research Center before the property transfer occurred. BMDO and LLNL also started initial development of new, ultra-lightweight hypersonic interceptor rockets that could be deployed from Pathfinder and its derivatives. The interceptor, called Astrid, flew several successful missions during this time period at Vandenberg AFB, CA.
NASA Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus - This unmanned plane, built by AeroVironment as a part of the NASA ERAST Program, demonstrated that an airplane could stay aloft for an extended period of time fueled purely by solar power. After initial successes, the Pathfinder was rebuilt into the larger Pathfinder Plus, which is also on display at the National Air and Space Museum.[3] Dale Tietz from the Pentagon's BMDO program transferred the Pathfinder aircraft to NASA for the ERAST Program, where AeroVironment managed its development as a non-weaponized variant.
NASA Centurion - The Centurion was an expansion of the Pathfinder concept, designed to achieve the ERAST Program goal of sustained flight at 100,000 feet (30,000 m) altitude.[3]
NASA Helios Prototype - Derived from the Centurion, this solar cell and fuel cell powered UAV set a world record for flight at 96,863 feet (29,524 m). It was intended to be the prototype for the production Helios aircraft, envisioned as an "atmospheric satellite". The ERAST program was terminated in 2003, and as of 2008 Helios has not entered production.[3] In actuality, it has been reborn in the form of the Global Observer UAS, currently in development under a Joint Concept Technology Demonstration led by USSOCOM.[4] The key technology shift was switching from solar power to liquid hydrogen power.
AeroVironment Global Observer - The Los Angeles Times reported first flight of Global Observer happening at the Mojave Desert in the first week of January, 2011.[5] Global Observer is powered from hydrogen, appears to have 4 motors with twin-bladed props, has a 175-foot (53 m) wingspan, 65,000-foot (20,000 m) maximum altitude, airspeed greater than 120 mph (190 km/h), and 5 to 7 day maximum flight duration.[6]
Sunraycer - This solar-powered car won the first world's first solar car race in Australia in 1987. The next fastest car finished two days after the Sunraycer. This car is at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.
GM Impact - This was an electric car, developed as a serious prototype for a mass-production consumer car.
AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven - a small military UAV. It is hand launched with a wingspan of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) and a weight of 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), providing color and infrared video to its handheld ground control as well as remote viewing stations. Over 9,000 Ravens have been delivered or are on order as of June 2008.
AeroVironment Wasp III - a miniature, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 3.1 miles (5.0 km). In 2007, the Wasp was selected by the US Air Force as the choice for their BATMAV Program.[7] As of 2008, over 1,000 Wasp aircraft have been delivered to customers worldwide.
AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma - a small lightweight, battery powered, hand-launched production UAV that provides aerial observation at line-of-sight ranges up to 6.2 miles (10.0 km). Puma's avionics enable autonomous flight and precise GPS navigation. It was originally designed to demonstrate advanced propulsion technologies for such aircraft. It flew in June 2007 for five hours[8] powered by an onboard "fuel cell battery hybrid energy storage system." Another attempt in November 2007 saw a flight time greater than seven hours.[9] These experimental flights integrated ProCore fuel cell from Protonex Technology Corporation[10] and hydrogen generation technology from Millennium Cell, Inc. On July 2, 2008, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma AE variant as its All Environment Capable Variant (AECV) solution.
AeroVironment Nano Hummingbird - Announced in 2011, a hummingbird look-alike drone equipped with a camera, can fly at speeds of up to 11 miles (18 km) per hour. It can climb and descend vertically, fly sideways, forward and backward, as well as rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise by remote control for about eight minutes.
AeroVironment SkyTote - a VTOL-fixed wing hybrid UAV, which has attained the advantages of both plane designs (respectively VTOL takeoff capability and decreased energy usage).
Aerovironment Switchblade - A miniature, electrically powered, armed unmanned drone kamikaze weapon, for use by deployed military troops in the field.[11]

AeroVironment Snipe - Informed by the Nano Hummingbird, a small quadrotor design small enough to be deployed by an individual to collect surveillance information. It weighs 5 oz (0.14 kg), can reach speeds of 20 mph (32 km/h) with a range of more than 0.6 mi (0.97 km), employs rechargeable batteries to fly for 15 minutes, can withstand winds of 15 mph (24 km/h), and is equipped with EO/IR, low light-capable and long-wave infrared sensors to take photos or video in day or night conditions. In May 2017, the first 20 Snipes were delivered to an undisclosed U.S. military customer.[12]

Programs[edit]
AeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.[8]
As a US-based provider of products and technology for clean energy and efficient vehicles, AeroVironment has received a United States patent for technology that facilitates the optimal charging, management, control and maintenance of battery packs, chargers and electric vehicles (EVs).[citation needed]
In 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1[13] and $19 million for Phase 2.[14][15][16] The "Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering.[17] However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.[18]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
