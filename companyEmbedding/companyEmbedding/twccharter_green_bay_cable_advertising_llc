Time Warner Cable Takes next Step to Transform Internet and TV Experience in Bowling Green
Customers to enjoy dramatically faster Internet speeds, beginning March 16

Release Date: 03/16/2016



Bowling Green, KY (March 16, 2016) – Time Warner Cable (TWC) customers in Bowling Green will soon benefit from major enhancements that will transform their service as they know it today. This superior customer experience, dubbed “TWC Maxx,” features ultrafast Internet speeds, state-of-the-art TV services and best-in-class reliability.
“With TWC Maxx, we’re essentially reinventing the TWC experience,” said Mark Dunford, Area Vice President, Time Warner Cable. “We will boost Internet speeds for customers up to six times faster, dramatically improve the TV product and set a high bar in our industry for differentiated, exceptional customer service.”
The key components of TWC’s new customer experience are:
New Internet Experience for Residential Customers
The Internet transformation will begin March 16, and will include speed increases on TWC residential Internet plans, with customers experiencing increases up to six times faster, depending on their current level of Internet service. For example, customers who subscribe to Standard, formerly up to 15 Mbps, will receive up to 50 Mbps; customers who subscribe to Extreme, formerly up to 30 Mbps, will receive up to 200 Mbps; and customers who subscribe to Ultimate, formerly up to 50 Mbps, will receive up to 300 Mbps, with no change in their monthly plan price.
Some customers will need to switch out their modems to receive the faster speeds and they will be communicated with via mail, email and phone messages with information on how to obtain a new modem.
New TV Experience
The advanced TV experience includes a new slate of next-generation video features, including an expanded On Demand library with more than 30,000 titles. Network enhancements in Louisville have already enabled the launch of Enhanced DVR, which lets customers simultaneously record up to six different programs and save 150 hours of high-definition (HD) programming on its 1TB (terabyte) hard drive — which is twice the storage of the largest prior model.
Rock-Solid Network Reliability
As TWC has committed to new network performance standards companywide, this initiative will include a stringent review and upgrade of every network connection site (referred to as hubs) to ensure optimum service levels are delivered to every neighborhood. Each TWC hub serves thousands of customers with TV, Internet, phone and home management and security services.
