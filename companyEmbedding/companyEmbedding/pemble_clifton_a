Posted By: irnet
January 5, 2016


Share        Shares of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ:GRMN) are rather mute this morning in pre-market trading, although the company just announced several new products to their lineup — one of which is a bicycle headset that warns a rider of traffic that is behind him/her.
Garmin Ltd.’s (NASDAQ:GRMN) Varia Vision headset not only can provide a cyclist with important data such as notifications, directions, etc., but it can also, with the help of Varia rearview radar, tell the individual when there is traffic behind them. Additionally the company is released their new Garmin Drive lineup intended for increasing a driver of a car’s situational awareness. 







“The most exciting development of the new Garmin Drive line is that driver awareness features typically seen in luxury vehicles are now accessible as an aftermarket solution for all drivers,” said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of worldwide sales. “There are many distractions that drivers encounter while running errands, driving to work or taking road trips. These new driver alerts can remove some of these burdens and help drivers stay aware on the road.”
Garmin Drive will include data from social services like Foursquare, intuitive traffic updates, detailed landmarks, and even traffic lights. Garmin DriveSmart which is a slightly upgraded product will add customizable smart notifications for text messages, calls and more. Garmin DriveAssist will include a built-in dash-cam that will record and save video footage to a microSD card. Garmin DriveLuxe is the company’s top-of-the-line device and it is housed in a forged metal case. It adds HD Digital Traffic that updates every 30 seconds.
