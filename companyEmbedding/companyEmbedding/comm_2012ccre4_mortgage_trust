Part II - OTHER INFORMATION
�
Item 2. Legal Proceedings.
�
On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (�RMBS�) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the �District Court�) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the �Federal Court Complaint�). In
December 2014, the plaintiffs� motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Federal Court Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Federal Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to: (i) notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged Events of Default, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged Events of Default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of
action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the District Court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases against Wells Fargo are proceeding before the same District Court judge. A similar complaint was also filed May 27, 2016 in New York state court by a different plaintiff investor. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Federal Court Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Federal Court Complaint; the District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints as to the remaining, non-dismissed trusts, if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. On December 17, 2016, the investor plaintiffs in the 261 trusts dismissed from the Federal Court Complaint filed
a new complaint in New York state court (the �State Court Complaint�). Motions to Dismiss all of the actions are pending except for the recently filed State Court Complaint. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigations, or the possible impact of the litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs� claims vigorously.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (�DBTCA�) acts as the certificate administrator and custodian for the COMM 2012-CCRE3 Mortgage Trust Securitization transaction, which services the Emerald Square Mall loan combination, a portion of which is included in the COMM 2012-CCRE4 Mortgage Trust.
�
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (�DBTCA�) and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (�DBNTC�) have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain RMBS trusts. 
�
On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a derivative action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBNTC and DBTCA�s alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label
RMBS trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500 trusts that are governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss.� On March 22, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in federal court.� In the amended complaint, plaintiffs assert claims in connection with 62 trusts governed by Indenture
Agreements.�� The amended complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $9.8 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain.� On July 15, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.� As of September 2, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA�s motion to dismiss has been briefed and is awaiting decision by the court.� Discovery is ongoing. 
�
On March 25, 2016, the BlackRock plaintiffs filed a state court action against DBTCA in the Superior Court of California, Orange County with respect to 513 trusts.��On May 18, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with respect to 465 trusts, and included DBNTC as an additional defendant.��The amended complaint asserts three causes of action:��breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; and breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest.��Plaintiffs purport to bring the action on behalf of themselves and all other current owners of certificates in the 465 trusts.��The amended complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $75.7 billion, but does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain.� On August
22, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a demurrer as to Plaintiffs� breach of fiduciary duty cause of action and breach of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest cause of action and motion to strike as to Plaintiffs� breach of contract cause of action.� On October 18, 2016, the court granted DBNTC and DBTCA�s demurrer, providing Plaintiffs with thirty days� leave to amend, and denied DBNTC and DBTCA�s motion to strike.� Plaintiffs did not further amend their complaint and, on December 19, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the amended complaint.� Discovery is ongoing.
�
On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, �IKB�), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts.� On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, violation of New York�s Streit Act, violation of the Trust Indenture Act, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.� IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. $268 million in
damages.� On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss.� On January 6, 2017, IKB filed a notice of discontinuance, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to three trusts.� As of January 17, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA�s motion to dismiss has been briefed and is awaiting decision by the court.� Certain limited discovery is permitted to go forward while the motion to dismiss is pending.
�
It is DBTCA�s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA�s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as certificate administrator and custodian under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the COMM 2012-CCRE3 transaction.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The 10-year loan requires only interest payments during its term and pays a coupon of 4.625 percent. Its companion piece was securitized through COMM, 2012-CCRE4. The loan allowed the property's owner, an affiliate of Wilmorite Management Group, to take out a total of $140.8 million of debt, $90.3 million of which was securitized through Morgan Stanley Capital I In., 2004-HQ4, and take nearly $55 million of cash out of the property, which is comprised of a shopping mall and power center.

$75 million piece of a $110 million debt package against Harmon Corner, a 66,833-square-foot retail property across the street from the CityCenter complex on the Las Vegas Strip. The 10-year loan allowed the property's owner, a group including W.P. Carey, to pay off a $47.6 million loan that Carey had provdied for the property's construction. The new loan pays a coupon of 4.188 percent and matures in 10 years. The property is expected to generate $10.6 million of net operating income.
$70 million loan against 200 Varick St., a 430,397-sf office building in lower Manhattan owned by a group led by Jeffrey Gural, chairman of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.
