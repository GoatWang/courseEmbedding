Service Level Agreement » Numetric




































































 

 
Numetric



Service Level Agreement





This Numetric Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) governs the use of the Services under the terms of the Numetric Terms of Service (the “TOS”) between Numetric Inc (“Numetric”, “us” or “we”) and users of the Services (“you” or “Customer”). Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject to the terms of the TOS and capitalized terms will have the meaning specified in the TOS. Numetric reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the TOS.
The Services shall be available 99.9%, measured monthly, excluding scheduled maintenance. If Customer requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance. Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Company’s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Company’s entire liability, in connection with Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than one hour, Company will credit Customer 5% of Service fees for each period of 30 or more consecutive minutes of downtime; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per day. Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as Customer (with notice to Company) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues until the availability of the Services is restored. In order to receive downtime credit, Customer must notify Company in writing within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for one (1) week of Service Fees in any one (1) calendar month in any event. Company will only apply a credit to the month in which the incident occurred. Company’s blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of Company to provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.

Pros:  Easy to use, great visualization of information
Cons:  Haven't had much of a chance to see if there are other ways I can configure the data or capture other data other than my team's specific support cases.
Overall:  Numetric has assisted me and my team with helping to visualize the work they've been doing on a per quarter and per year basis.  It's helped me figure out where my stronger reps are and to target them for assistance catching up with the rest of the group.  Keeping this kind of data for 10+ people used to be a hassle.

Comments:  Great customer service but the technology still has some holes. 
Loved the drill down capability, metric customization, and the overall look and feel but the number of available metric types is an issue.
We also fought against some of the number formats. 
Definitely headed in the right direction but it's a little underdeveloped for the price.

Pros:  The look of Numetric is inviting and easy to look at. 
Cons:  There are still tweeks and changes that need to be made to take this from a good BI solution to a Great Bi solution. 
Overall:  Working with Numetric staff has been easy and pain free. Numetric its self is still growing and getting better with every update. Along the way, the staff has been great about stepping in and helping us solve our problems or taking our suggestions and applying in future updates. Our overall experience with Numetric has been a good one.

Comments:  We have been using a tracking system for some time to gather our data, but its been very lackluster. With Numeric, it simplifies the information and allows us to pull up things in a much cleaner setting and review information faster. We are very satisfied with this unique tool and look forward to having it as a staple in our data management.

Pros:  Simple, Looks great, Excellent support.
Cons:  Still trying to understand how to set up views and having trouble fully understanding the process.  
Overall:  Our company has been looking for an analytics tool for a long time. We were referred to Numetric and quickly realized that it was a tool we had to have at our company. The capabilities are truly incredible. Its also important to recognize that when deciding on a platform like this to use for your business, there will be support needed. I can't speak highly enough of the team at Numetric. They are there whenever you need them and constantly go above and beyond. It is extremely valuable to be able to have people helping with the setup of this type of service, and the team at Numetric is always willing to go above and beyond whenever we need them.

Pros:  Very pleasing to the eye. graphical interface works well. 
Cons:  updates to the data to back the graphs doesn't happen often
Overall:  We only update the database 2 times a day, it would be better to have the update instantaneous. If that were the case I would use it more but when it is up to date it's very nice to work with. 
Recommendations to other buyers: instantaneous updates would be great.

Pros:  Very powerful
Cons:  Not alot of use case beyond what is presented by system.
Overall:  Seems to be a responsive system. Not that I use alot big data analytics...; however, the NS system that we use is big and cluncky.
Recommendations to other buyers: Give more examples of use that is applicable to targeted audiences. Not necessarily the buyers of the system.

Pros:  Ease of use and customer service
Cons:  Still working to ensure all data sources are syncing appropriately, but everytime there is an issue, the Numetric team gets it fixed.
Overall:  Our company has a number of different data sources that we wanted to consolidate.  Looked at other dashboard tools out there and also creating the tools ourselves.  Numetric proved to be a great partner and very willing to help.  They don't have all the features yet, but I am confident they have  a path to get there and that is the sort of company I want to align ourselves with.  Best of all is that they are very easy to work with and their technology is extremely user friendly.  Would certainly recommend.
Recommendations to other buyers: Great partner

Overall:  Former Director of Asset Management for the Utah Department of Transportation. Numetric provided the agency the ability to quickly query through its inventory consisting of 100,000 signs, 16,000 lanes miles, 1,800 structures, in effect all assets. Numetric also provided apps tied  to the agency's design and safety business processes. Utah was able to achieve significant savings in time, resources and funding.

Pros:  Very responsive and capable support.
Cons:  Only supports flat files right now (though they can be very large, multi-million-record files with a hundred columns and still have excellent, responsive performance). Numetric indicated that the ability to work with relational databases through their platform is coming soon!
Overall:  Numetric is highly responsive to customer requests and has provided reliable service. They have helped us manipulate our datasets for inclusion into the dashboards and the tool is fast and intuitive. We love numetric!
Recommendations to other buyers: Numetric's staff is phenomenal. They're best-in-class in terms of responsiveness and helpfulness. If you need something done, they do their best to help quickly and efficiently, and are a pleasure to work with.

Pros:  Ease of implementation, flexible whole data set search approach, open ended architecture that enables search and analytics filters for every data set we have. Numetric quickly enables what-if iterations and speed to decision time that facilitates Agile management approaches. 
Cons:  Typical new software development issues where features and functionality are evolving. Given the core efficiencies we have gained in a very short time in using Numetric, it is easy to become impatient for more ground breaking features. To date, Numetric has followed a logical path in how their functionality has evolved. We trust their development path going forward. 
Overall:  Numetric represents an important new threshold in data visualization and meaningful analytics. It represents a transition similar to the days of standalone word processors with proprietary software and specialized operators to leaping to Microsoft Word in Windows. The end data user can now readily manage their own data compared to current tech heavy specialists necessary for even getting Tableau to work well. Sequel search Is well on its out thanks to the whole data set approach of Numetric. Numetric requires far fewer tech intermediaries to gain live data analytics. Numetrics is a game changer for rank and file decision makers as well as top level executives. Perhaps the most important factor that Numetic brings to us is it's ability to access live data from numerous data sets in disparate software sources and otherwise enable us to have a real time virtual enterprise system that avoids the inflexibility and expense of typical ERP systems. Numetric has allowed us to "see" our business very easily and quickly with minimal disruption and planning. It has enabled us to iterate our way through our true operational review of how our business truly operates. We can easily see all the incongruencies in operations that a team of traditional management consultants would have spent several months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to decipher. Numetric provides phenomenal iterative power for quickly establishing baseline operations knowledge and then enabling us to pursue the visualized issues that Numetric makes readily apparent. Clear, timely and easy data analytics iterations via Numetric make strategic planning, problem solving, efficiency reviews and overall operational assessments far more intuitive and compelling. Numetic gives the executive end user far more power to utilize their own inate knowledge of business operations than any business analyst or tech intermediary can typically provide in their limited knowledge of the true workings of their respective enterprises. We are executives that can now move through our own enterprise analytics far easier than through the lenses of the many intermediaries needed for Tableau or other Sequel search platforms. 
Recommendations to other buyers: Based on all the functionality limitations and deployment issues surrounding other data visualization tools we have either used or investigated, Numetic tempts us to think like we did when we found Lotus 123 years ago to steal information power away from the mainframe technology lords.

Pros:  Ease of use, and support
Cons:  I didn't find it 2 years ago
Overall:  Tried Numetric and loved how fast it gives me what I want. It still lets you share data well like Domo, but now the non tech-savvy guys in my office can use Numetric. I share access with them and they have no problem clicking through and finding information.

Comments:  I hate waiting... And Business Intelligence tools usually require a lot of waiting. It¿s frustrating to have to wait for reports to run, especially when they end up leading to more questions... and more reports.
We tried Numetric at our office and I don¿t think we can go back... It¿s so much easier to sit down in the conference room, bring up our dashboard and get what we need. I don¿t run nearly as many reports anymore and we can actually spend our time working instead.

Nitestar DMI Vehicle Distance MeasurerNote: On some vehicles - specifically trucks, the OBDII adapter will not report the proper speed to the DMI display, resulting in lower than actual distances measured. For the vehicles on which this problem has been observed, the distance recorded will be less than 10% of actual.
The average survey can be completed simply by using the four large keys on the left side of the instrument. Ideal for measuring highways, school bus routes, telephone pole spacing, gas pipelines, E-911 addressing, cable TV length, postal routes, railway length, field crop length, etc. Features include non-volatile, unlimited internal memory for storing numerous events along with the distance they occur; auto calibration memory for up to 4 vehicles; speed trap function; unlimited event memory for inventory, including event names; special functions for computing material needs (area, volume, tonnage); back-lit keypad and display; and an interval distance display for logging distance between events. A sensor and a vehicle installation kit or appropriate cable kit are required for use (sold separately).
Note: A sensor and a vehicle installation kit or appropriate cable kit are required for use.
On some vehicles–specifically trucks–the OBDII adapter will not report the proper speed to the DMI display, resulting in lower than actual distances measured. For the vehicles on which this problem has been observed, the distance recorded will be less than 10% of actual.
Sensor is sold with the understanding that it will be installed by a professional installer with the required expertise and supporting documentation such as Mitchell or Motor electrical service manuals or equivalent. Users who attempt to install or install a sensor assume all responsibility for problems caused by incorrect or improper installation.
