FORT SMITH, Ark., Feb. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ArcBest Corporation® (Nasdaq:   ARCB) today announced that President and Chief Executive Officer Judy R. McReynolds has been elected to the additional role of Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective immediately following ArcBest's 2016 Annual Meeting, succeeding Robert A. Young III who will retire on that date.
The company also announced the election of current board director Steven L. Spinner as Lead Independent Director, a newly created position, for a one-year term. Spinner, 56, has been a director of the ArcBest board since 2011. He is currently President, CEO and board member of United Natural Foods, Inc. 
As Lead Independent Director, Spinner's duties will include:  together with the Chairman/CEO, planning, reviewing and approving meeting agendas for the Board; advising the Chairman/CEO of the information needs of the Board; acting as a liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors; and calling meetings of the independent directors.
"My pride in ArcBest and in the caring attitude that our employees demonstrate daily for customers goes back a long way," said Young. "Seeing this company grow has given me enormous gratitude. Judy has been a strong leader in her six years as CEO, and as she takes on the role of Board Chairman, I have great confidence that our company is in the right hands for the future."
McReynolds thanked Young for his dedicated service and congratulated him and his wife Mary on their well-deserved retirement.
"Robert's stewardship of ArcBest over so many years has been simply invaluable," said McReynolds. "His association with ArcBest first began 65 years ago when his father, Robert A. Young Jr., purchased our first trucking company in 1951. Throughout those many years, Robert's devotion and positive influence on our company have been evident and impactful. His deep industry knowledge and commitment to doing the right thing have led our company to expand far beyond our regional roots to become a premier provider of transportation services across the country. His guidance and friendship have meant a great deal to me personally and so many others here, and we will miss him greatly."
Young, 75, has served as a director of ArcBest, previously known as Arkansas Best, since 1970, Board Chairman since 2004 and has reached the retirement age outlined in the company's bylaws. Capping a long career at the company that began in 1964, he served as CEO from 1988 until his retirement from that position in 2006. From 2004 to 2006, Young also served as President, CEO and Board Chairman. 
McReynolds, 53, an 18-year-veteran of ArcBest, has been president and CEO of ArcBest since 2010 and prior to that served as the company's chief financial officer. 
McReynolds also serves on the board of publicly held OGE Energy Corp. She is current Chairman of the Board of the American Transportation Research Institute and also serves on the board and executive committee of the American Trucking Associations, the Transportation Industry Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the Dean's Executive Advisory Board of the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, along with other nonprofit organizations.
Spinner, who has broad expertise in wholesale food distribution, logistics and network businesses, currently serves on the board's audit committee. As an executive who has overseen the integration of two merged companies and is currently an active CEO of a public company, Mr. Spinner is well suited to the position of Lead Independent Director.
"Beginning with the acquisition of Panther Premium Logistics in 2012, ArcBest has undergone a significant transformation into a full-service logistics company and there are many ongoing initiatives underway in which the board is deeply engaged," said Spinner. "I look forward to serving in this new position and helping the company reach its next level of success."

Judy R. McReynolds is president and CEO of ArcBest Corp., responsible for managing the multibillion-dollar logistics company, including oversight of operating companies ABF Freight, ABF Logistics, Panther Premium Logistics, and FleetNet America. Since 2010, McReynolds has also held the post of director of ArcBest Corp. and is the only member of the company’s senior management who serves on the board.  A Certified Public Accountant, she has nearly 25 years of transportation industry experience, including 18 years at ArcBest where she began as controller. McReynolds has led the company’s recovery from the economic downturn. Building upon ABF Freight’s 90-year-old roots as a leading LTL carrier, the company has undergone a substantial rebranding under McReynolds’ leadership, purchasing Panther, and forming ABF Logistics to complement its LTL offering.  The strategy, which she developed and directed, was to provide full supply chain and logistics solutions to customers and to better “connect the dots” for them about the breadth of solutions offered by the ArcBest companies. By the end of 2015, the asset-light businesses represented nearly one-third of ArcBest’s total revenue. McReynolds considers that evolution her top achievement at ArcBest. “We describe ArcBest as a logistics company, not simply trucking, as that is one piece of our business but by no means all,” she says. “Like many other industries, ours is undergoing rapid change as evolution in technology and customer demands drive the need for constant change and adaptation.” In a first-person column for the New York Times business series “The Boss,” McReynolds wrote that she determined early in her executive tenure that she wouldn’t let gender be an issue—and she credits her Oklahoma upbringing with making her secure enough to not react to those who would.  Click to see a list of all the Fleet Owner Dozen honorees  “Our industry traditionally has a lot of male representation, although there is clearly a recent trend towards more female representation,” McReynolds says. “We believe in promoting the best person for every role. As a result, we have various leadership academies, training and recruiting programs that are in place for all of our employees.” McReynolds’ advice for women is to take on the “tough assign­ments” and do an excellent job. “You will be recognized for your good work,” she says. “As long as companies like ArcBest are focused on putting the best people in leadership, more of our industry’s leaders will be women.” McReynolds serves on numerous boards, including OGE Energy Corp., First National Bank of Fort Smith, and the Transportation Industry Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. She also serves on the Dean’s Executive Advisory Board of the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, is chair of the UAFS Foundation Board, and is a member of the American Trucking Assns. board of directors and Executive Committee.  McReynolds holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of Oklahoma.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Judy R. McReynolds
Chairman, President and CEO
ArcBest Corporation
Judy R. McReynolds is President and Chief Executive Officer of ArcBest CorporationSM, responsible for managing the multi-billion dollar freight transportation and logistics services company, including oversight of the operating companies ABF FreightSM, ABF LogisticsSM, Panther Premium LogisticsSM and FleetNet America®. Since 2010, Ms. McReynolds has also held the post of Director of ArcBest Corporation, and is the only member of the company’s senior management who serves on the board. Her nearly 25 years of transportation industry experience, including 17 years at ArcBest, provides significant value to the board.
During her tenure, Ms. McReynolds has evolved the ArcBest strategic focus to expand beyond its core less-than-truckload services in order to better serve customers across the supply chain spectrum. Building upon ABF Freight’s 90-year-old roots as an LTL leader, she is diversifying ArcBest into an all-inclusive transportation and logistics provider through the addition of non-asset-based and asset-light businesses. These include the 2012 purchase of Panther, which provides time-sensitive, mission-critical delivery and premium logistics, and the 2013 formation of ABF Logistics as a complementary sister company to ABF Freight.
Previously, Ms. McReynolds was Senior Vice President – Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Vice President – Controller, and Director of Corporate Accounting when she joined the company in 1997. Prior to joining ArcBest, she served as Director of Financial Reporting and Taxation with P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. and as a Senior Manager of Ernst & Young LLP.
Ms. McReynolds serves on numerous outside boards including OGE Energy Corp., First National Bank of Fort Smith, the Transportation Industry Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the Westark Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. She also serves on the Dean’s Executive Advisory Board of the Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas, the UAFS Foundation Board and is a member of the American Trucking Associations Board of Directors and Executive Committee. A Certified Public Accountant, Ms. McReynolds holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of Oklahoma.
