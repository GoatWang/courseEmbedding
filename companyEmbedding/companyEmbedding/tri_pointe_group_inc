"I am pleased to announce that TRI Pointe Group recorded another quarter of strong operational and financial performance for the second quarter of 2017, highlighted by a 15% increase in net new home orders and net income of $32.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share," said TRI Pointe Group Chief Executive Officer Doug Bauer.  "We met or exceeded our previously stated guidance for backlog conversion, homebuilding gross margin and quarter-end community count, and put ourselves in a great position to achieve our goals for the back half of the year, thanks in part to a 31% increase in the dollar value of our backlog.  These results are a testament to the overall health of the housing market, TRI Pointe's strong market positioning and our ongoing commitment to operational excellence."
Second Quarter 2017 Operating Results 
Net income available to common stockholders was $32.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017, compared to net income available to common stockholders of $73.9 million, or $0.46 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016.  The decrease in net income available to common stockholders was primarily driven by two land transactions in the second quarter of 2016 representing $61.6 million in land and lot sales revenue and $52.7 million in land and lot gross margin, with no comparable transactions in the current year period.
Home sales revenue increased $11.9 million, or 2%, to $568.8 million for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $556.9 million for the second quarter of 2016.  The increase was primarily attributable to an 8% increase in new home deliveries to 1,071, offset by a 5% decrease in average selling price of homes delivered to $531,000 compared to $560,000 in the second quarter of 2016.
New home orders increased 15% to 1,445 homes for the second quarter of 2017, as compared to 1,258 homes for the same period in 2016.  Average selling communities increased 6% to 126.8 for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 119.5 for the second quarter of 2016.  The Company's overall absorption rate per average selling community for the second quarter of 2017 was 11.4 orders (3.8 monthly) compared to 10.5 orders (3.5 monthly) during the second quarter of 2016.  
The Company ended the quarter with 2,108 homes in backlog, representing approximately $1.3 billion. The average sales price of homes in backlog as of June 30, 2017 increased $64,000, or 11%, to $635,000 compared to $571,000 at June 30, 2016.  
Homebuilding gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2017 decreased to 20.1% compared to 22.3% for the second quarter of 2016; however, it increased 130 basis points sequentially from the first quarter of 2017.  Excluding interest and impairments and lot option abandonments in cost of home sales, adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage was 22.5%* for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 24.4%* for the second quarter of 2016.  The decrease in homebuilding gross margin percentage was largely due to the mix of homes delivered, in particular a lower portion of homes delivered from our long-dated California communities, which produce gross margins above the Company average.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense for the second quarter of 2017 increased to 11.6% of home sales revenue as compared to 11.3% for the second quarter of 2016 due to the incremental general and administrative costs associated with growing our Company. 
"TRI Pointe continues to be at the forefront of homebuilding, with unique home designs and thoughtfully engineered communities that cater to the lifestyles of today's homebuyers," said TRI Pointe Group Chief Operating Officer Tom Mitchell.  "We have placed an added emphasis on creating living spaces that appeal to two of the biggest buyer segments in the marketplace - Millennials and Active Adults - and our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of these efforts.  We believe that our commitment to homebuilding design and innovation gives us a competitive advantage over other production homebuilders, and creates long-term value for our stockholders."

For the third quarter of 2017, the Company expects to open 10 new communities, and close out of 19, resulting in 122 active selling communities as of June 30, 2017.  In addition, the Company anticipates delivering approximately 50% to 55% of its 2,108 units in backlog as of June 30, 2017 at an average sales price of approximately $570,000.  The Company anticipates its homebuilding gross margin percentage to be in a range of 19.0% to 20.0% for the third quarter.
For the full year 2017, the Company is lowering its original guidance of growing average selling communities by 10% to 8% due to the higher than anticipated absorption rate through the second quarter of 2017, causing early close out of communities.  In addition, the Company is raising the lower end of its anticipated delivery range from 4,500 to 4,600 homes, resulting in a delivery range between 4,600 and 4,800 homes.  The Company is reiterating its original guidance of a full year average sales price of $570,000, a homebuilding gross margin percentage in a range of 20.0% to 21.0% and a SG&A expense ratio in the range of 10.2% to 10.4% of home sales revenue.  In addition, the Company is raising its original guidance of land and lot sales gross margin to approximately $50 million, from $45 million, most of which is expected to be realized in the third quarter of 2017.
Stock Repurchase Program
On July 25, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 million of Company common stock under the Company's existing Repurchase Program, increasing the aggregate authorization from $100 million to $150 million. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company may repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock with an aggregate value of up to $150 million through March 31, 2018. Purchases of common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Program may be made in open market transactions effected through a broker-dealer at prevailing market prices, in block trades, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  We are not obligated under the Repurchase Program to repurchase any specific number or amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the program at any time.  Our management will determine the timing and amount of repurchase in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and legal requirements.  For the three months ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased and retired 7,979,618 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program at a weighted average price of $12.43 per share for a total cost of $99.2 million.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased and retired 8,019,005 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program at a weighted average price of $12.43 per share for a total cost of $99.7 million.  With the increase to the Repurchase Program, the total remaining authorization for future repurchases under the Repurchase Program is approximately $50.3 million.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(unaudited)
In this press release, we utilize certain financial measures that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We present these measures because we believe they and similar measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company's operating performance and financing structure. We also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following tables reconcile homebuilding gross margin percentage, as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP, to the non-GAAP measure adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that leverage has on homebuilding gross margin and permits investors to make better comparisons with our competitors, who adjust gross margins in a similar fashion.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)(unaudited)
The following table reconciles the Company's ratio of debt-to-capital to the non-GAAP ratio of net debt-to-net capital. We believe that the ratio of net debt-to-net capital is a relevant financial measure for management and investors to understand the leverage employed in our operations and as an indicator of the Company's ability to obtain financing.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)(unaudited)
The following table calculates the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciles those amounts to net income, as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA means net income before (a) interest expense, (b) income taxes, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) expensing of previously capitalized interest included in costs of home sales and (e) amortization of stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA means EBITDA before (f) impairment and lot option abandonments and (g) restructuring charges. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (or similarly titled measures) differently. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of the Company's ability to service debt and obtain financing.

Homebuilder stocks fall after several downgrades at Barclays
Homebuilder stocks slumped broadly Tuesday, after Barclays downgraded several of them, and reiterated a bearish view on some others, citing concerns that valuations suggest investors may be too optimistic in the face of data pointing to moderating buyer traffic trends. Toll Brothers Inc.'s stock  shed 1.6% after analyst Michael Dahl downgraded it to underweight from equal weight, while shares of Lennar Corp.  fell 1.5%, PulteGroup Inc.  lost 0.6% and TRI Pointe Group Inc.  dropped 1.7% after Dahl downgraded them to equal weight from overweight. Shares of KB Home  slipped 0.2%, Meritage Homes Corp.  gave up 0.8% and Realogy Holdings Corp.  lost 0.3% after Dahl reiterated his underweight ratings. "Our June A.G.E.N.T. Survey indicated moderating buyer traffic trends, warning of risk that near-term catalysts for builders will disappoint relative to rising expectations," Dahl wrote in a note to clients. Separately, CalAtlantic Group Inc.'s stock  bucked the sector's trend by rallying 0.8%, after Dahl upgraded it to equal weight from underweight, citing its recent underperformance relative to the group. The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF , which was down 0.6% in morning trade, has run up 25% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.4% this year.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Five Pillars That Define Us
Recognition










Our Story

In 2009, Doug Bauer, Tom Mitchell and Mike Grubbs shared a vision and concept for a new kind of homebuilding company – one driven by home design that provides homebuyers and their families with a lifetime of experiences.


That year, the economic downturn crippled many industries. However, they recognized this time as an opportunity to bring their vision to life. They drew upon their 25+ years of homebuilding know-how to create TRI Pointe Homes. 


TRI Pointe Homes quickly became a publicly held company, trading under “TPH” on the NYSE. It was the first IPO in homebuilding to emerge after the downturn. Within 5 years, the company merged with Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company (WRECO), which operated as five distinct homebuilding companies in seven states, to become TRI Pointe Group. This merger has created one of the top 10 largest public homebuilding companies in the United States based on equity market capitalization.

Our Vision

TRI Pointe Group represents a family of premium local homebuilders and offers the best of big and small: the agility, accountability and strong community ties of trusted local builders, backed by the stability and thought leadership of a major national company. 


For us, thought leadership means seeing our industry in a new way: We believe we’re not just in the homebuilding business, we’re in the life-changing business – designing smarter homes that inspire better lives.

Life Inspiring Homes

Life that inspires homes. Homes that inspire life. It’s our toughest mission and highest calling.






Five Pillars That Define Us









The best of big and small.


That line says it all. We're combining the financial resources, economies of scale, purchasing power, thought leadership, and research & development capability of a national organization with the agility, local insight and trusted relationships of regional homebuilders to create a unique model in the marketplace.







Customer driven.


Where we build, what we design, how we market our services - and the overall experience we create - all spring from a deep understanding of what our homebuyers want and how they live. We research, mine data, and conduct workshops so we can create solutions that exceed their expectations and become an integral part of their lives.
But we don’t just focus on life inside the home. Like a good neighbor, we believe in the idea of community in every sense of the word. We build upon local values through philanthropic projects and social outreach efforts. We’re also leading the way in sustainability and environmentally responsible business practices through our branded programs like LivingSmart.







A lifestyle brand.


Production homebuilding largely grew out of land acquisition and construction-based disciplines. But, when you think about it, no other consumer product is as influential in the way people live and the quality of life they enjoy as a home. So, we place it at the center of everything we do. We approach design, merchandising, marketing, and the consumer experience with the same curious, open mind as other leading lifestyle brands.







A premium position.


Our family of homebuilding brands enjoys “added-value” stature in each of their markets and segments when it comes to design, culture and lifestyle. And we are building on that. Rather than a “mass market” pricing and marketing strategy, we go beyond basic shelter towards life enhancement and dream fulfillment for discerning home shoppers across price points. It’s a market position and promise we will continue to own and cultivate - through the design, craftsmanship and services we provide.







A passionate culture.


We care passionately about our homebuyers, the communities in which we build, and our team members who make it possible.
In fact, our team is our greatest asset. That’s why we carefully select and train remarkable, impassioned individuals that want to make a difference.
We empower them to be a change-agent, using entrepreneurial spirit to bring their best thinking and energy to the collective cause. In doing so, everyone helps to advance our vision of home buying, home building, and home ownership to the next level with integrity, drive and teamwork.
