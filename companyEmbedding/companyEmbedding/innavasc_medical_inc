DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--InnAVasc, Inc., a medical device company that designs and develops 
      products for vascular and hemodialysis access, today announced that 
      Joseph A. Knight, PhD, MBA, has been appointed President.
    


      “We are pleased to announce Joe’s appointment as President,” said 
      Jeffrey Lawson, Chief Executive Officer of InnAVasc. “As we continue the 
      development of the Bullet Proof vascular graft, we wanted someone 
      with a breadth of knowledge in bringing forward medical technologies. We 
      believe that Joe’s experience and track record will be invaluable to our 
      successful development and commercialization of Bullet Proof.”
    

      Dr. Knight joins InnAVasc with nearly 15 years of experience in medical 
      device innovation. He has been part of the intellectual property 
      development, business, and strategic planning for four different

      Medtronic in various roles in marketing, business development, and 
      strategy. In his last role with Medtronic, as the Director of Strategic

      “There are numerous unmeet clinical needs related to hemodialysis 
      vascular grafts,” said Dr. Knight. “Results to date of InnAVasc’s Bullet 
      Proof technology show significant promise to alleviate many of these 
      needs and provide a substantially better device than those currently 
      available. I look forward to joining the InnAVasc team and leading the 
      effort to bring improved vascular grafts to patients and physicians that 
      can benefit from them.”

Duke Angel Network invests in vascular graft company InnAVasc Medical


November 28, 2016
Kaitlin Jansen
News


The Duke Angel Network today announced an investment in InnAVasc Medical, Inc. (“InnAVasc”), a Durham-based medical device company that has developed a next-generation vascular graft for use in hemodialysis patients. The Duke Angel Network’s investment in InnAVasc is its first investment in a company formed around intellectual property that was developed at and licensed from the university. The Duke Angel Network led the round.
InnAVasc’s first product, the Bullet Proof Vascular Access Graft, includes novel features to reduce the incidence of thrombosis (clotting within the circularity system), hematomas (collection of blood outside the blood vessel), aneurysm (bulging of blood vessel), and infection. The Bullet Proof graft also increases the speed and reliability of access procedures. The graft’s unique features include a self-sealing access zone, a back-plate to prevent the access needle from puncturing through both sides of the graft, and innovative geometries to ensure reliable access.
InnAVasc was founded by Dr. Jeffrey Lawson, an active vascular surgeon and research leader at Duke whose laboratory has successfully developed a number of molecular, cellular, and tissue engineered technologies. InnAVasc’s CEO, Dr. Joseph Knight, holds an MBA from Duke’s Fuqua School of Business as well as a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Dr. Knight was previously in various roles at Medtronic as well as serving as Founder and CEO of Medici Medical Technologies. He is also an inventor of the initial patents of iRhythm Technology.
“The investment in InnAVasc is a perfect example of what the Duke Angel Network was formed to do – support innovative Duke-affiliated startup companies with funds from Duke-affiliated investors,” said John Glushik, the Duke Angel Network’s Managing Director. “We are particularly excited to have worked with Duke’s Office of Licensing & Ventures and the InnAVasc team to be a part of the commercialization of this technology.”
“The Duke Angel Network is an important vehicle to bring investment to Duke affiliated startups,” said Dr. Knight. “These funds are particularly important to early stage companies. InnAVasc is grateful for the investment and partnership of the Duke Angel Network, as well as the broader Duke and Triangle wide community. The capital raised will enable InnAVasc to continue our mission of providing improved vascular access products for patients undergoing hemodialysis.
