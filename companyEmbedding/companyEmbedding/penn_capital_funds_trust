Our Story



At Penn Capital, we believe that understanding a company’s entire capital structure is the best way to identify investment opportunities with the most value. In fact, we’ve found that managing credit portfolios makes us better equity managers; and vice versa. We select stocks or high yield debt securities with the greatest potential to provide the risk-adjusted returns our clients expect.
Our fully integrated credit and equity research process focuses on non-investment grade companies in the micro- to mid-capitalization range, where we can take advantage of inefficient security pricing. We serve institutional and individual investors with strategies that reflect institutional-quality rigor and insight and stay true to our philosophy.
We are an independent, employee-owned boutique investment management firm based in Philadelphia. We forge our own ideas, we respect hard work, and we are committed to our clients, our staff and our community.

Do jetpacks exist?



A:
There are multiple examples of functional jetpack technology, though not all of these machines make use of jet propulsion technology, and very few of them approach the functionality of those jet packs seen in science fiction or cartoons. Some real-life jet packs only make very limited flights, while others are more like machine-powered parachutes that don't have the ability to lift off from the ground independently.
