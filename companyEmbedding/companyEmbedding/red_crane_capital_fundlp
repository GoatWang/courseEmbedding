About – Overview – Red Crane Property Investments






























 










Overview








Red Crane Property Investors is a private equity real estate firm that is focused on creating sustainable value and delivering good risk-adjusted returns for our investors and partners.
Red Crane’s value creation is based on (i) a disciplined approach to underwriting supported by strong fundamentals and (ii) asset operating experience.  Our platform’s focus on hospitality and residential assets in Asia and selected global gateway cities serves as a differentiator, but we will also deploy capital in other asset classes on an opportunistic basis.
Our objective is to build a compelling platform that delivers sustainable value to our investors with real estate assets that generate good risk-adjusted returns.  We focus our efforts through leveraging our team’s experience, our collective areas of expertise, our global experience combined with local knowledge, and our network of local partners.
We take a granular approach to fundamental analysis and a thorough technical and analytical understanding of global macro fundamentals with practical knowledge of local real estate markets.  We target unique investment opportunities that have strong imbalance of supply/demand fundamentals, events driven, market dislocations, and other esoteric opportunities to unlock hidden value.  We have the knowledge and experience investing in development projects, asset enhancements, distressed assets, special situations, mezzanine lending, and credit opportunities.  We are focused on leveraging our operating and execution experience to deliver superior value to our investors.
Red Crane invests its own capital and with the capital from ultra-high net worth individuals, family offices and institutions.
Red Crane believes the platform’s success will be as a result of its experienced management team that brings over 70+ years of real estate and hotel investments, operations and management expertise.  The Red Crane team also has extensive experience in real estate acquisitions, divestment, development, project management, and asset management.  In addition, Red Crane management has deep knowledge and experience in private equity, legal, corporate finance and capital markets.
