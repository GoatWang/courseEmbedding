                        Robert M. Gervis
                    

                    Director
                


Robert M. Gervis, age 56, has served as a director since September 2009. Mr. Gervis has been a self-employed advisor and investor since April 2009, as well as a member of various public and private company boards of directors. Prior to April 2009, he served in various senior executive positions at Fidelity Investments from 1994 to March 2009; and before Fidelity, Mr. Gervis was a partner in the international law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Mr. Gervis earned a Juris Doctorate from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering from Lehigh University. Mr. Gervis is also a CFA charter holder. Mr. Gervis is a director of Aspen Aerogels, Inc., a publicly traded manufacturer of aerogel insulation products sold to the oil and gas, cryogenic transportation, building and construction, military and aerospace industries.During his tenure with Fidelity Investments, Mr. Gervis spent twelve years managing businesses and senior executives, including investment professionals charged with evaluating a wide range of investment opportunities, and operating and managing those investments once they were acquired or made. The Company believes that Mr. Gervis’ management experience at Fidelity Investments included serving as (1) Chief Executive Officer of an oil and natural gas exploration and production company; (2) Chief Operating Officer of a full-service real estate development and investment company that specialized in the acquisition, design, development and management of high-profile projects in both the United States and foreign markets; and (3) Managing Director of a private equity division that invested in a broad range of industries, including technology, biotechnology, real estate, oil and gas exploration and production and telecommunications. The Company believes that these positions, combined with the sophisticated transactional work Mr. Gervis managed while he was a partner at the international law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, gives Mr. Gervis significant insight into, and understanding of, the methods and processes used to assess and evaluate potential investment opportunities and other complex transactions that may be presented to the Company. In addition, because Mr. Gervis has served on many boards and investment committees and currently serves on two for-profit boards of directors, the Company believes he has substantial experience regarding how boards can and should effectively oversee and manage companies, and a significant understanding of governance issues.

			Robert M. Gervis has served on our board of directors since January 2011.  Mr. Gervis has been a self-employed advisor and investor since April 2009, as well as a member of various public and private company boards of directors.  Prior to April 2009, Mr. Gervis served in various senior executive positions at Fidelity Investments from July 1994 to March 2009.  Mr. Gervis' management experience during his tenure with Fidelity Investments included serving as (i) Chief Executive Officer of an oil and natural gas exploration and production company from December 2002 to March 2006; (ii) Chief Operating Officer of an international, full-service real estate development and investment company from May 2002 to June 2003; (iii) Managing Director of a private equity division from March 2002 to March 2006, which invested in a broad range of industries, including technology, biotechnology, real estate, oil and gas exploration and production and telecommunications; and (iv) President of Ballyrock Investment Advisors from April 2006 to March 2009, a registered investment adviser which managed Fidelity Investments' structured credit business.  Prior to joining Fidelity Investments, Mr. Gervis was a partner at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
