HITE MLP
Advantage Fund LP

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        HITE MLP Funds are managed as a long-only, unleveraged strategy for those desiring long MLP exposure as part of their overall portfolio. The Fund's focus is on energy infrastructure. These are one of the few funds to rapidly trade MLPS with high turnover and active management.
