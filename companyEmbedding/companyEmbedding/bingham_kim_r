About Kimberly

Kimberly Bell has a diverse practice that includes litigation, intellectual property work, contract review, and regulatory compliance. With regard to her litigation practice, Kim has experience with product liability and casualty litigation, health care litigation, real estate and title litigation, and insurance coverage issues. With her background in computer science and computer engineering, Kim loves handling intellectual property issues, including drafting and reviewing licensing contracts, trademark work, and copyright matters.

Q&A
Expand All
Collapse All



What previous experiences, prior to your work at Balch, influence your practice?
Prior to attending law school, I worked as a business technology consultant for IBM Global Business Services in the retail and healthcare sectors. I traveled the country regularly to assist clients in implementing technology solutions to meet their business needs. This unique experience working with numerous large corporations, gave me insight into the proper balance between business demands and desires, understanding the bottom line, and providing helpful legal guidance.
In addition, my background in computer science and computer engineering predisposes me to an interest in intellectual property. I don't shy away from technical, science-intense matters.   


How are you involved in your community?
Being involved in my community is very important to me. Some of my favorite ways to give back to my community include serving the homeless through the legal clinic and volunteering in soup kitchens where I have the opportunity to prepare and serve meals. One of my favorite organizations that I serve on is the Children's Village Junior Board, which assists a group home for abandoned, neglected children.  
I am also very involved in the local bar associations, including the Birmingham Bar Association and the Magic City Bar Association. I serve on the Diversity and Inclusivity Committee of the BBA and the Membership Committee of the MCBA.
