Job Details
               Guthrie Healthcare System (GHS) and St. James Mercy Health System have reached an agreement to enter into an affiliation aimed at enhancing physician recruitment and expanding technological capabilities at St. James Mercy Hospital. The effective date of this new arrangement is July 1, 2011. Talks between the two health systems began over one year ago. Both parties believe an agreement has been reached that honors the history and tradition of excellent care at St. James Mercy Hospital, while taking advantage of the strengths of the Guthrie system to most effectively meet the changing health care needs of patients in the Hornell region. "We have expended a great deal of time and effort identifying the right partner to help us keep and strengthen services where they are needed and to attract new specialties," said Mary LaRowe, president and CEO of the St. James Mercy Health System. "We are confident we have found that partner in Guthrie. They offer a stellar track record of delivering high quality care and services in rural settings, and we are excited about what they bring to the table." LaRowe added, "It is reassuring to see the type of financial turnaround that Guthrie helped bring about for Corning Hospital. That facility went from a challenging situation to such a positive position that they are planning for a new, state-of-the-art facility. A remarkable change like that does not happen without a strong partnership, and Guthrie is just such a partner." LaRowe went on to say that St. James Mercy patients will have greater access to specialty services otherwise requiring significant travel, as well as enhanced convenience with the eventual introduction of an electronic medical record. "This partnership will also strengthen our ability to carry out our mission of serving the poor, the underserved, and disadvantaged," she said. "Guthrie's expertise in delivering health care and proven track record of recruiting physicians to rural settings will support St. James Mercy Hospital's efforts to keep a great institution viable in the face of a challenging economic landscape," said Judith Persichilli, president and CEO of Catholic Health East, the national health care system of which St. James Mercy Health System is a member. GHS will assist St. James Mercy in recruiting physicians to its service area; these physicians will be employed by St. James Mercy. In addition, Guthrie Healthcare will provide assistance in the development of an electronic medical record, and in the areas of personnel management, finance, quality review and strategic planning. "This is a great step for two great health systems," said Mark Stensager, president and CEO, Guthrie Healthcare System. "The partnership between St. James and Guthrie strengthens us both. St. James will benefit from Guthrie's medical resources and administrative support, and as Guthrie recruits physicians for western Steuben County, the successful growth of those practices, in turn, increases all patients' access to care for the twin tiers region." Joseph A. Scopelliti, M.D., president and CEO of Guthrie Clinic, said, "With fewer people entering the medical profession, recruitment of physicians has to be one of the priorities for any organization looking to grow. The St. James medical staff has a proud history of service and we look forward to partnering with them to further that service." Founded in 1890, St. James Mercy Hospital is comprised of the hospital, McAuley Manor and eleven clinics located throughout the rural service area. The mission statement of St. James Mercy emphasizes the goal of "being a transforming, healing presence within the rural communities we serve, particularly addressing the needs of the poor, underserved and disadvantaged." St. James Mercy has 297 licensed beds and provides a full range of services including emergency, acute medical and surgical, adult and adolescent psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, in-patient addiction rehabilitation, skilled nursing care, adult day care, dialysis, and behavioral health day treatment. Special services include sleep disorders studies; cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation; physical, occupational and speech therapy; long term ventilator care, and a school of radiologic sciences. St. James Mercy Health System is a member of Catholic Health East, a multi-institutional Catholic health system based in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. The System provides the means to ensure the continuation of the Catholic identity and operational strength of the sponsors' health ministries, which are located within 11 eastern states from Maine to Florida. The System includes 33 acute care hospitals, four long-term acute care hospitals, 25 freestanding and hospital-based long-term care facilities, 14 assisted-living facilities, four continuing care retirement communities, eight behavioral health and rehabilitation facilities, 37 home health/hospice agencies, and numerous ambulatory and community-based health services. Guthrie Healthcare System, a nonprofit organization is comprised of the Guthrie Clinic, a multi-specialty medical practice with 260 physicians and more than 130 midlevel providers located throughout Pennsylvania and New York - and three hospitals: Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, Pa., Troy Community Hospital in Troy, Pa., and Corning Hospital in Corning, NY.

A woman who pleaded guilty in 2004 to strangling her girlfriend and dumping her body at Kelley Point Park may not have been the killer and should be released or retried by the state, a federal judge ordered.
In an 81-page opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh said new DNA analysis and other evidence raises doubts about whether Lisa Marie Roberts strangled Jerri Lee Williams, a Northeast Portland woman with a history of prostitution and drug use, in May 2002. Williams' naked body was found down a slope from the parking lot at Kelley Point Park, which is at the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette rivers.
That finding alone would not be sufficient to release her, and Marsh stopped short of deeming her "probably innocent" of the crime. But the possibility of her innocence allows him to consider an otherwise-expired claim that her trial lawyers had provided ineffective counsel, the judge wrote. After reviewing the case, he wrote, he agreed that she had been denied her constitutional right to effective counsel.
Multnomah County prosecutors' case against Roberts was built in large part on circumstantial evidence, he wrote.
Roberts had been living with another woman, Terry Collins, in the 7800 block of Southeast 65th Avenue when the two met Williams, Marsh wrote. Roberts and Williams developed a romantic relationship, which sparked a "volatile love triangle," among the three.
Marsh noted a past history of domestic abuse, in which Roberts had choked Collins to the point of unconsciousness and had once repeatedly punched Williams, Marsh wrote. Another witness also reported seeing Roberts slam Williams against a wall. In addition, Collins and others said Roberts had made statements on several occasions threatening to "take care" of Williams and put her "six feet under" and made other comments regarding wanting to hurt one of Collins' girlfriends.
On Saturday, March 25, 2002, Williams called a friend to say she was going to come see her at the Madison Suites Motel on Northeast 82nd Avenue after going to the McDonald's restaurant nearby, Marsh wrote. Roberts said she dropped off Williams sometime between 9 am and 9:30 a.m. at the McDonalds before heading toward Gresham to pick up Collins' daughter, who was going to spend the weekend with her, she said.
Williams' friend never saw her arrive at Madison Suites. Her body was found just before 3 p.m. with a pillowcase near her body.
When questioned, Roberts gave conflicting statements about Williams' plans and if she last saw her heading into McDonalds or going to the motel. She also gave detectives conflicting information for her route to pick up Collins' daughter, saying that she missed exits and had to double back before getting to the right location.
Investigators pulled Roberts' cell phone records, finding that she and Collins' daughter had exchanged three phone calls between 9:38 a.m and 10:27:59 a.m. The third call connected to a cell phone tower in Vancouver, about three miles from Kelley Point Park, the opinion states. Roberts maintained that the closest she would have come would be along Interstate 205 at Marine Drive.  That location is about 10 miles from Kelley Point Park.
Medical examiners had collected DNA evidence from Williams' body, including material from under her fingernails and breast as well as sperm collected from vaginal swabs. The sperm did not draw a match when state investigators ran it through a database in 2002.
Police theorized that Roberts had killed Williams at home, placed her body in a sleeping bag with a pillowcase over her head, driven her in a pickup and dumped her body at the park sometime before 10:27 a.m when her call to Collins' daughter bounced off the Vancouver cell tower.
Roberts, then 37, was prepared to go to trial, Marsh wrote, based on statements from her lawyers at the time. But just before trial was to begin, prosecutor Rod Underhill, now Multnomah County District Attorney, shared information with the defense about cell phone evidence he planned to introduce.
Roberts' lawyer, William Brennan, told her the data would pinpoint her location near Kelley Point Park and which direction the call was coming from and advised her to plead guilty, according to the opinion. Brennan has since died.
But technical experts hired for Roberts' federal case countered that cell phone tower data cannot pinpoint a person's location or the direction from which the call is being made. In addition, the experts noted that the prosecution did not consider the wide area that the tower was designed to cover nor other variables such as the call load, network of the tower and the cell phone provider's software all of which could affect which tower handles a person's cell call.
Marsh found that Brennan failed to adequately investigate or hire an expert to evaluate the cell phone tower evidence, and instead relied on the prosecutor's expert.
"Despite the critical importance of the cell tower evidence, Brennan failed to take reasonable steps to collect the relevant data and independently evaluate the reliability of the Verizon technician's preliminary analysis before advising his client to plead guilty to manslaughter," Marsh wrote.
He notes that Roberts would likely have insisted on going to trial, except for her lawyer's failure to evaluate the cell phone data and hire an expert. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison and three years of post-prison supervision and has been serving her time at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility.
Roberts' team offered other evidence as well, including the results of new DNA analysis in 2013 that showed links between the genetic material recovered from Williams' body with two men who knew her.
The defense argued that one of them, who is currently in prison on sex abuse charges, used to live at the Madison Suites Motel had frequently harassed Williams into getting her to prostitute for him, according to Williams' son. Other witnesses offered information about his connection to Williams, and court documents cited by the opinion accuse him of hitting, choking and threatening women. 
The state has 90 days to decide whether it wants to retry Roberts.
"We are working to determine all of our options and then we will review each option and make a decision about which is the most appropriate one to pursue," Underhill said in an email.
Federal Public Defender Steve Wax, who argued the habeas corpus appeal in U.S. District Court with Assistant Public Defender Alison Clark, hailed the decision, which came on the same day he was celebrating the launch of the Oregon Innocence Project.
Wax announced recently that he will be stepping down as Oregon's top federal public defender at the end of September to join the nonprofit, which seeks to exonerate wrongfully-convicted defendants, as its legal director.
He noted that 20 to 25 percent of those who are later exonerated nationwide have pleaded guilty or confessed to a crime, one of the reasons the Oregon Innocence Project will help fill a need.
"Here," he said, of the decision, "is proof of why we need this."
