Government Properties Income Trust: As Sustainable As It Gets - Government Properties Income Trust (NYSE:GOV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Government Properties Income Trust: As Sustainable As It GetsJun.15.17 | About: Government Properties (GOV) Cash-Centered Creep Dividend growth investing, dividend investing, long-term horizonSummaryGovernment Properties recently released their Q1 figures.The strongest advantage this REIT has is its position as the U.S. government's biggest landlord.Combined with their other assets, this seems a safe, lucrative investment.A business that is stable, provides steady income, and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future is one any income investor would want in their portfolio - and it is my opinion that Government Properties Income Trust (NYSE:GOV) is such a business. On April 27, Government Properties Income Trust released their Q1 figures, with Q1 FFO of $0.56 missing estimates by $0.03 and revenues of $69.28 million, beating estimates by $1.84 million. The earnings miss was addressed the April 27 conference call by President and COO David Blackman, who asserted that it "was negatively impacted by our noncash charge at SIR due to a tenant bankruptcy." By SIR, Blackman was referring to Select Income REIT (NYSE:SIR), a firm in which Government Properties has a 28% stake. Nonetheless, Blackman also stated that "our operating results remained stable." In light of this report, it is worth taking a look at Government Properties as a prospective investment. Government Properties Income Trust is a REIT that focuses the bulk of its property portfolio on government tenants. Indeed, they hold the distinction of being the U.S. government's biggest landlord, offering 73 properties containing 11.4 million square feet across 31 states and in Washington, D.C., to federal and state government departments and agencies. This fact alone makes Government Properties an attractive investment. The U.S. government is as reliable a tenant as it gets. The likelihood of the Federal government defaulting on rental payments is extremely unlikely. The sheer diversity of U.S. government agencies making use of Government Properties makes plain just how dependent the government is on this REIT for its office space:   Agency Rentable Square Feet % of Rentable Square Feet % of Annualized Rental Income   Citizenship and Immigration Services 448,607 3.9% 8.1%   Internal Revenue Service 1,041,806 9.1% 7.8%   U.S. Government* 406,388 3.6% 4.5%   Federal Bureau of Investigation 304,425 2.7% 3.2%   Centers for Disease Control 352,876 3.1% 2.9%   Department of Justice 227,201 2.0% 2.9%   Customs and Border Protection 243,162 2.1% 2.5%   Bureau of Land Management 304,831 2.7% 2.3%   Department of Veterans Affairs 280,699 2.5% 2.3%   Defense Intelligence Agency 266,000 2.3% 1.9%   Immigration and Customs Enforcement 136,395 1.2% 1.9%   Social Security Administration 189,645 1.7% 1.7%   Bureau of Reclamation 212,996 1.9% 1.7%   National Park Service 166,745 1.5% 1.7%   U.S. Courts 115,366 1.0% 1.6%   Department of Health and Human Services 128,645 1.1% 1.2%   National Archives and Record Administration 352,064 3.1% 1.1%   Drug Enforcement Agency 93,177 0.8% 1.1%   Department of Energy 140,152 1.2% 1.0%   Defense Nuclear Facilities Board 60,133 0.5% 1.0%   Department of State 89,058 0.8% 0.9%   U.S. Postal Service 321,800 2.8% 0.8%   Occupational Health and Safety Administration 57,770 0.5% 0.8%   Bureau of the Fiscal Service 98,073 0.9% 0.7%   Centers for Medicare and Medicade Services 78,361 0.7% 0.7%   Military Entrance Processing Station 56,931 0.5% 0.7%   Department of Housing and Urban Development 82,497 0.7% 0.6%   Environmental Protection Agency 43,232 0.4% 0.6%   Department of the Army 228,108 2.0% 0.6%   General Services Administration 20,535 0.2% 0.4%   Bureau of Prisons 51,138 0.4% 0.4%   Food and Drug Administration 33,398 0.3% 0.3%   Department of Defense 31,030 0.3% 0.3%   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 21,439 0.2% 0.2%   Small Business Administration 8,575 0.1% 0.1%   U.S. Coast Guard 4,064 0.0% 0.0%   Department of Labor 6,459 0.1% 0.0%   Subtotal 6,703,781 58.6% 60.6%   *Agency occupant cannot be disclosed As the table shows, the Federal government's rent of the office space provided by Government Properties generates 60.6% of the REIT's annual income. In addition to this, the REIT also gets rental income from state government departments and agencies in states such as California, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia. It also profits from its 28% stake in Select Income REIT. The strength of the position that Government Properties enjoys can be gleaned from its financials. The REIT has a total debt to total capital ratio of 59.99%, with $2.39 billion worth of assets, $1.39 billion worth of debt, and total cash on hand worth $29.94 million. The revenue figures for the 2012-2016 period show how steadily profitable Government Properties is.   Year Revenue ($)   2012 203.70 million   2013 226.91 million   2014 251.03 million   2015 248.55 million   2016 258.18 million   Such revenue figures have supported the steady dividend payments that Government Properties has paid their shareholders since 2010. Prospective shareholders are currently offered a dividend yield of 7.70% with a somewhat high but tolerable payout ratio of 75.4% backed by a solid business model. The key risk to this business would be the inability to either renew their leases with their existing tenants or find new tenants for its properties. However, this REIT has minimized this risk admirably: The leases that do exist are not set to start expiring until 2021, and the nature of the tenants - government agencies - would find it cumbersome to relocate their operations to other premises. The likelihood that the current tenants will renew their leases when the expiry date approaches is therefore very strong. Investors can therefore assume that Government Properties Income Trust looks set to continue collecting rental fees from the U.S. government and rewarding their shareholders for years to come, and proceed accordingly.

S&P 500 posts biggest one-day gain in 2 months as financial shares rally 

Jun. 28, 2017 at 4:36 p.m. ET
by Carla Mozee









First Potomac Realty Trust to be bought in a $1.4 billion deal by Government Properties 
First Potomac Realty Trust  announced Wednesday an agreement to be acquired by Government Properties Income Trust  in a deal valued at $1.4 billion, including debt. Under terms of the deal, First Potomac shareholders will receive $11.15 a share in cash for each First Potomac share they own, which is 1.8% below Tuesday's closing price of $11.35, but a 5.1% above the April 24 close of $10.61, which was the last trading day before media speculation of a potential sale of the real estate investment trust. The deal is expected to close before the end of the year. First Potomac's stock has gained 3.5% year to date through Tuesday, while Government Properties shares have rallied 15%. In comparison, the SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF  has climbed 5.7% so far this year and the S&P 500  has tacked on 8.1%.

S&P 500 posts biggest one-day gain in 2 months as financial shares rally 

Jun. 28, 2017 at 4:36 p.m. ET
by Carla Mozee









First Potomac Realty Trust to be bought in a $1.4 billion deal by Government Properties 
First Potomac Realty Trust  announced Wednesday an agreement to be acquired by Government Properties Income Trust  in a deal valued at $1.4 billion, including debt. Under terms of the deal, First Potomac shareholders will receive $11.15 a share in cash for each First Potomac share they own, which is 1.8% below Tuesday's closing price of $11.35, but a 5.1% above the April 24 close of $10.61, which was the last trading day before media speculation of a potential sale of the real estate investment trust. The deal is expected to close before the end of the year. First Potomac's stock has gained 3.5% year to date through Tuesday, while Government Properties shares have rallied 15%. In comparison, the SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF  has climbed 5.7% so far this year and the S&P 500  has tacked on 8.1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Government Properties Income Trust has a five member Board of Trustees, of which three are Independent Trustees. There are three standing Committees of the Board: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board has also adopted Governance Guidelines and Committee Charters for each of these Committees.
The Board’s Audit Committee currently has a qualified Audit Committee "financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. We also have a Director of Internal Audit who reports directly to the Board’s Audit Committee.
All of the company’s Trustees, officers and personnel are subject to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. On December 8, 2015, Government Properties Income Trust’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") was amended to clarify policies regarding reporting of conflicts of interest and violations of the law and the Code.  The Code was also revised to recognize that our manager is now controlled by a public company.
