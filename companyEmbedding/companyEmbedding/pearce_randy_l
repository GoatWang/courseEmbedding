      between the independent directors and senior management, and will call 
      meetings of the independent directors, as appropriate.
    


      David Jaffe, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ascena, commented, 
      “Randy has consistently been a strong, objective voice on Ascena’s 
      board. We are pleased to formalize and recognize his role and 
      responsibility, and to reinforce our commitment to strong governance 
      with the amendments announced today.”
    

      The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has adopted 
      amendments to its by-laws that now provide for a majority-voting 
      standard for uncontested director elections. Any incumbent director who 
      does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast in such an 
      election will be required to tender his or her resignation to the Board 
      of Directors, which would then determine whether to accept the 
      resignation.
    

      The Company’s Board of Directors also adopted a set of Corporate 
      Governance Guidelines that, among other things, include policies and 
      procedures relating to the Lead Independent Director role and the 
      majority voting standard, as well as restrictions on hedging 
      transactions and pledging transactions by directors and executive 
      officers.
    

      Additionally, the Board of Directors has expanded the responsibilities 
      of the Nominating Committee to include making recommendations relating 
      to corporate governance matters, and has renamed such Committee the 
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
    

      The Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K that will contain 
      further details. A copy of the Current Report, the amended and restated 
      by-laws, the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Nominating and 
      Corporate Governance Committee Charter will also be available on the 
      Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, at www.ascenaretail.com, 
      click on “Investor Relations”.
