ABOUT TODD SIEGEL
 hello, I craft prototypes with interactive animation for mobile apps (iOS/web) - driven by 12+ years experience in user centered design. I'm the product evangelist here at Proto.io - giving live webinars, and presentations at places such at Xerox PARC, Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID) and Product School - spreading the value and process of creating and testing prototypes that feel real early in the product design process.  A few links for now... Check out the article and product concept tutorial I wrote for the February issue of Net Magazine, "Design Prototypes That Feel Real - with Proto.io"http://bit.ly/Article_Tutorial_NetMag  I gave a presentation on Interaction First Design at The Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID)http://ciid.dk/todd-siegel/  The New Yorker interviewed me along with other members of the 10x management network about the future of work http://bit.ly/new_yorker_article  If you'd like to see my work portfolio, please DM me on http://twitter.com/toddsiegel  On the side, every side, I'm a wordsmith - performing product concept satire and producing http://www.wordperformances.com  Enjoy.

This is prototype was created for the Net magazine article "Design Prototypes That Reel Real - with Proto.io.

It includes a step-by-step written tutorial with screenshots here:
http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/design-prototypes-feel-real-protoio-21619311

It's a product concept for juxtaposing two photos and typing a caption about the connection between them. It should look like this.

The tutorial starts with bringing in a range of external assets. Then it'll show how to design assets and customize native components within the tool. Interactions will be triggered by gestures, keyboard input, and automatically as the prototype loads, then choreographed along an animation timeline.

The recently released Google Inbox app is a re-thinking of the email inbox experience that beautifully demonstrates Google's material design interactive animation language. 

This prototype focuses on the compose button's animation. Click the + to reveal a new state where a wave of buttons and labels float up, and the + becomes a pencil icon. It uses two states, with staggered animations.
