Partnerships













Hennessy Research is a good example of the quality of Morphogenesis partners. Dr. Kris Hennessy, an internationally recognized equine expert, is conducting Morphogenesis’ equine field study to test the safety and efficacy of its IFx-EqM vaccine, a direct DNA form of the ImmuneFx cancer vaccine portfolio. The study involves the treatment of malignant melanoma, an insidious disease that affects gray horses and up to 80% of older horses. Equine melanoma manifests in many different ways, making it notoriously difficult to treat. Melanomas have benign and malignant variants that can be locally invasive as well as metastatic and can vary from superficial skin lesions to obstructive gastrointestinal lesions causing weight loss, constipation, and colic; to neurologic involvement resulting in lameness and lack of muscle control. The variable presentation of melanoma and resistance to therapy stems from multiple mutations that result in the formation of abnormal proteins. These mutations, which occur in melanoma at considerably higher rates compared to other malignancies, disrupt the normal functions of the cells. Even individual tumors within a single patient continue to mutate, making melanoma a constantly moving and diverging target. ImmuneFx is designed to turn the abnormal patient-specific tumor proteins into its advantage by exposing all of them to the immune system and reducing the chance a tumor cell can escape. The equine melanoma study is taking place near Kansas City, MO, the international hub of veterinary healthcare.

Industry Innovator
Morphogenesis is a privately-funded biotechnology company that has established itself as a leader in the rapidly growing cell therapy, biologics and tissue engineering fields.
What does this mean? Cell therapies target the disorder, not the symptoms, and may ultimately provide a cure.
Although each of the company’s numerous experimental, patent-pending and patented technologies offer significant benefits to mankind, Morphogenesis has primarily focused on the extremely promising multi-indication therapeutic cancer vaccines, ImmuneFx.
ImmuneFx is a vaccine, not a drug, that educates a patient’s own immune system to attack tumor cells throughout the body without damaging normal cells or systems. ImmuneFx is effective in treating a variety of cancers, and targets multiple tumor antigens while many other technologies are aimed at single antigens and limited types of cancers.
ImmuneFx can be delivered in three different forms, each with cost effective manufacturing, logistical, and administration processes. Proven to prime and educate the immune system to target multiple tumor antigens, ImmuneFx is a formidable standalone therapy and the perfect partner for a checkpoint inhibitor combination.
