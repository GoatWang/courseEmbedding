					Full Description



Essent Group Ltd., incorporated on July 1, 2008, is a private mortgage insurance company. The Company is engaged in offering private mortgage insurance and reinsurance for mortgages secured by residential properties located in the United States. Its products and services include mortgage insurance, contract underwriting, and Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance. The primary mortgage insurance operations were conducted through Essent Guaranty, Inc. (Essent Guaranty), a mortgage insurer, which was licensed to write mortgage insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of December 31, 2016. It offers primary mortgage insurance, pool insurance and master policy. It provides contract underwriting services through CUW Solutions, LLC (CUW Solutions), which is a subsidiary of Essent Holdings, Inc. Its subsidiaries include Essent Agency (Bermuda) Ltd and Essent Reinsurance Ltd (Essent Re).Mortgage InsuranceThe Company's primary mortgage insurance is offered to customers on individual loans at the time of origination on a flow basis, but can also be written in bulk transactions. Most of its policies are primary mortgage insurance. Customers that purchase its primary mortgage insurance select a specific coverage level for each insured loan. For loans not sold to the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the customer determines its coverage percentage. The Company's risk across all policies written was approximately 25% of the primary insurance, but varied from policy to policy between 6% and 35% coverage, as of December 31, 2016.The Company's pool insurance provides additional credit enhancement for certain secondary market and other mortgage transactions. Its pool insurance covers the excess of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage.The Company issues a master policy to each customer approved as a counterparty by its risk department before accepting their applications for insurance. The master policy sets the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance coverage, including loan eligibility requirements, coverage terms, policy administration, premium payment obligations, exclusions or reductions in coverage, conditions precedent to payment of a claim, claim payment requirements, subrogation and other matters attendant to its coverage.Contract UnderwritingThe Company provides contract underwriting services on a limited basis. It assesses if data provided by the customer relating to a mortgage application complies with the customer's loan underwriting guidelines. These services are provided for loans that require private mortgage insurance, as well as for loans that do not require private mortgage insurance. It operates additional underwriting and service centers in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Irvine, California.Bermuda-Based Insurance and ReinsuranceThe Company offers mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through Essent Re, which provides insurance or reinsurance relating to the risk in force on loans in reference pools acquired by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, including in connection with Agency Credit Insurance Structure (ACIS) and Credit Insurance Risk Transfer (CIRT) programs. Essent Re also reinsured 25% of Essent Guaranty, Inc.'s GSE-eligible mortgage insurance, as of December 31, 2016.The Company competes with Arch Mortgage Insurance Company, Genworth Financial Inc., Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation and Radian Guaranty Inc.

Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may," "will," “should,” “expect,” "plan," "anticipate," "believe," “estimate,” “predict,” or "potential" or the negative thereof or variations thereon or similar terminology. Actual events, results and outcomes may differ materially from our expectations due to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and factors, they include, among others, the following: changes in or to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”), whether through Federal legislation, restructurings or a shift in business practices; failure to continue to meet the mortgage insurer eligibility requirements of the GSEs; competition for customers; lenders or investors seeking alternatives to private mortgage insurance; an increase in the number of loans insured through Federal government mortgage insurance programs, including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration; decline in new insurance written and franchise value due to loss of a significant customer; decline in the volume of low down payment mortgage originations; the definition of "Qualified Mortgage" reducing the size of the mortgage origination market or creating incentives to use government mortgage insurance programs; the definition of "Qualified Residential Mortgage" reducing the number of low down payment loans or lenders and investors seeking alternatives to private mortgage insurance; the implementation of the Basel III Capital Accord discouraging the use of private mortgage insurance; a decrease in the length of time that insurance policies are in force; uncertainty of loss reserve estimates; deteriorating economic conditions; our non-U.S. operations becoming subject to U.S. Federal income taxation; becoming considered a passive foreign investment company for U.S. Federal income tax purposes; and other risks and factors described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2017. Any forward-looking information presented herein is made only as of the date of this press release, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise.Read MoreNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn presenting Essent Group Ltd.’s results, management has included financial measures, including adjusted book value per share, that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

("Essent Re") in connection with Freddie Mac's Agency Credit Insurance Structure ("ACIS") program that were accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, these contracts were amended and are now accounted for as insurance contracts. The change in fair values of these policies was $2,012, ($755) and $677 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.            (2) Income tax expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was calculated using an annualized effective tax rate of 26.8% and was reduced by $3,023 of excess tax benefits associated with the vesting of common shares and common share units during the quarter. Prior to January 1, 2017, excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in-capital.           (3) Loss ratio is calculated by dividing the provision for losses and LAE by net premiums earned.           (4) Expense ratio is calculated by dividing other underwriting and operating expenses by net premiums earned.                                        Exhibit C, continued     Essent Group
