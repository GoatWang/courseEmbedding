New Generation Container Feeder Vessel Debuted                                                      

Knud E. Hansen, Copenhagen has developed the next generation of container feeder  vessels. The new generation was inspired by inquiries from major clients for these size feeder vessels. The superior efficiencies of the KEH MARK 1200 and 1500 have been achieved by making extremely compact vessels by using the experience gained from the KEH Mark V, Mark VI S, Mark VI, Mark VII and Mark X all designed by KEH, numerous ships of these designs have been build over the years. Compared to the competition, KEH has managed to design the vessels one FEU shorter, one box wider, with lines requiring less horsepower for the same capacity and speed, but also resulting in improved stability and a lower GT versus the container capacities.

Open House Welcomes Puyallup                                                                        

An open house was held on sleek Jumbo Mark II ferry Puyallup, to welcome it to its new home, the Edmonds/Kingston route. Later in the month, it was down to business as Puyallup began ferrying cars and passengers across the busy crossing. The arrival of Puyallup marks the culmination of a long process to bring more ferry capacity to the Edmonds/Kingston route. The building of three new Jumbo Mark II ferries - Wenatchee, Tacoma and Puyallup - has enabled the ferry system to move the original Jumbo ferries (Spokane and Walla Walla) to Edmonds/Kingston. Now, a Jumbo and Jumbo Mark II are assigned to the route, which is the second busiest in the ferry system in terms of total riders, behind Seattle/Bainbridge Island.



ShipConstructor2005 Updates                                                                         

Since releasing the 2005 version of ShipConstructor, an AutoCAD-based 3D product modeling software for shipyards and designers, Albacore Research Ltd. (ARL) has been working with customers to introduce more time- and cost-saving features. In collaboration with Japanese and Australian shipbuilders, two new features, Accuracy Control Marks and Automatic Straking, are offered. Small inaccuracies easily add up to significant deviations during multiple steps of assembly. Precise fabrication is a means of reducing rework, delays, and waste. In Japan, Accuracy Control Marks are used for two tasks: aligning stiffeners with high accuracy on plates as well as the accurate joining of plates for welding. This feature is now available through the latest update of ShipConstructor2005.

The Coast Guard Cutter James Rankin is scheduled to set the historic "Francis Scott Key" buoy off of Fort McHenry, Md., near the Key Bridge Monday, June 5, 2006. 

The buoy marks the spot where the ship carrying Francis Scott Key, the author of the Star Spangled Banner, was anchored during the bombardment of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812. Each year the buoy is set in the spring marking the historic location of the event and then removed in the fall.

The U.S. Coast Guard has issued a Safety Alert reporting that the Ikaros model Mark II Man-Overboard Smoke Signal may explode if the igniter mechanism is reinserted after ignition has commenced.  The device is designed to automatically ignite when pulled from its bracket.  It is used with a number of ring lifebuoys and is generally detached when the lifebuoy is deployed.  Owners and operators should consider replacing the model Mark II with the new model Mark III, which includes a pressure relief mechanism to prevent explosion due to pressure build-up.  In the meantime, owners and operators are encouraged to install warning placards advising crewmembers to not return the smoke signal to its bracket following ignition.
