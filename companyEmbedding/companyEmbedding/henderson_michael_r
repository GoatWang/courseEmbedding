MRI does not rely on X-rays. Instead, it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create a very sharp picture of the internal body structures. MRI uses sensitive instruments and specially designed computers to create images of the entire area being scannedSurgeonsOrthopedicsCongratulations to Dr. Michael Hoenig on being featured in the Spartanburg Herald Journal for his article in the American Journal of Orthopedics! The article by Dr. Hoenig studied the biomechanical comparison of hamstring tendon fixation devices for anterior ligament...Joint ReplacementDue to recent advances in technology in the surgical fields and anesthesiology, many procedures once deemed only able to be performed in an inpatient setting are now being performed safely and with great patient satisfaction in an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) as an outpatient procedure or with a 23-hour stay. There are many places throughout the country that are performing such joint replacements and spine procedures in an ASC setting, yet very few are located in SC. This would be the first ASC in Spartanburg offering both joint replacement and spine procedures.Hand SurgeryProcedures that will be performed in this surgery center include: total and partial knee and hip replacements; neck fusions; lumbar fusions and other spine procedures. In addition, these traditional orthopaedic procedures will be performed: shoulder, knee scopes, hand surgery and fractures.Orthopedic Surgery(SPARTANBURG, SC, JULY 21, 2016) Orthopaedic Associates, PA and Upstate Spine and Neurosurgery Center, PC announce merger and plans for an Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC). The physicians of the newly-formed practice, Carolina Orthopaedic and Neurosurgical Associates (CONA), will offer the most advanced training and experience in orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery and pain management in an ASC setting. CONA will allow the physicians to provide a wider range of services, deliver a higher quality of care to their patients, operate more efficiently and better meet patient needs in this age of healthcare reform.NeurosurgeryHip ReplacementChanges to anesthesia and other medications can reduce pain more effectively while also minimizing side effects like nausea that delay recovery. This thorough approach enables patients to experience only mild discomfort as they return home with a new joint the same day of surgery. The ASC setting allows the surgical team to provide more personal attention to patient care and education, which also allows patient and family to have a better understanding of all aspects of surgery, ongoing care, and postoperative expectations. The ASC setting offers increased flexibility based on the individual patient’s needs. Procedures that can be performed safely in an ASC setting include outpatient hip resurfacing, total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, total hip replacement, total shoulder replacement and many spine procedures. Typically these procedures provided in an ASC instead of a hospital setting can provide remarkable cost savings to the patient.Knee ReplacementDr. Mary Black and Dr. Michael Funderburk, specialists at Upstate OA, chat with the crew of Your Carolina. The discussion covers outpatient surgical procedures, shoulder issues, total knee replacement and other related topics. Dr. Black specializes in a wide variety of areas...NeurologistsCarpal Tunnel SyndromeCarpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common sources of hand pain and numbness. In the US, as many as 10 million people experience some symptoms of CTS each year, and approximately 500,000 surgeries to treat CTS are performed annually. The symptoms of CTS are variable, but left untreated, the progressive nerve damage that results may lead to permanent hand dysfunction.General PractitionersArthritisConservative methods of treatment such as bracing or splinting, medication or steroid injections may not be sufficient for many patients with CTS. Â Patients who have symptoms lasting longer than 10 months, who experience continual numbness, whose muscles in the base of the palm begin to shrink, or who are over the age of 50 are least likely to benefit from conservative methods. Â Appropriately timed surgery can prevent irreversible damage and improve symptoms and function.Physical TherapistsSports MedicineAbout the Author The medical staff at Orthopaedic Associates, PA, which include 10 specialist physicians and five physician assistants providing treatment in all aspects of orthopaedic medicine including sports medicine, hand & elbow, foot & ankle, spine, total joints and pain management.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Henderson Michael R carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Henderson Michael R



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
