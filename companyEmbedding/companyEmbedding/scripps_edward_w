Early life[edit]
E. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) (1855 - 1937) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages.
E. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. He often signed his middle name as "Wyllis".[1]
Newspaper career[edit]
Both E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half-brother, James when he founded The Detroit News in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found The Penny Press (later the Cleveland Press) in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company.
E. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the most successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not "sell out," but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers.[citation needed]
In 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, later the UPI news service, from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said "I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press", to provide competition to the Associated Press.[citation needed]
Scripps believed in editorial independence, stating,

A newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class [the advertisers] which furnishes the larger part of a newspaper's income. It must occasionally so antagonize this class as to cause it not only to cease patronage, to a greater or lesser extent, but to make actually offensive warfare against the newspaper.[2]

Later life[edit]
In 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby,[3] thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of Illinois, but eventually lived there year round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate.
In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, later renamed Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps University is also named in his honor, since a large part of its endowment derives from his newspaper fortune.
Scripps became somewhat of a hermit, calling himself a "damned old crank." He enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht, smoking 50 cigars a day.[citation needed]
Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century.

His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate.
In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, later renamed Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps University is also named in his honor, since a large part of its endowment derives from his newspaper fortune.
Scripps became somewhat of a hermit, calling himself a "damned old crank." He enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht, smoking 50 cigars a day.[citation needed]
Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century.

Early life[edit]
E. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) (1855 - 1937) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages.
E. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. He often signed his middle name as "Wyllis".[1]
Newspaper career[edit]
Both E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half-brother, James when he founded The Detroit News in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found The Penny Press (later the Cleveland Press) in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company.
E. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the most successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not "sell out," but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers.[citation needed]
In 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, later the UPI news service, from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said "I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press", to provide competition to the Associated Press.[citation needed]
Scripps believed in editorial independence, stating,

A newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class [the advertisers] which furnishes the larger part of a newspaper's income. It must occasionally so antagonize this class as to cause it not only to cease patronage, to a greater or lesser extent, but to make actually offensive warfare against the newspaper.[2]

Later life[edit]
In 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby,[3] thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of Illinois, but eventually lived there year round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate.
In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, later renamed Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps University is also named in his honor, since a large part of its endowment derives from his newspaper fortune.
Scripps became somewhat of a hermit, calling himself a "damned old crank." He enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht, smoking 50 cigars a day.[citation needed]
Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century.

        Culture
      


To our viewing audience, we’re primped and polished. When the “on air” light goes off, we’re much more comfortable being casual. Scripps is a place where creativity has taken over. We dress up when we need to, dress down when we can and always maintain professionalism. For the most part, Scripps is focused on creating great work, and great work comes from people who love what they do. 













        Benefits
      


Scripps provides the resources to help you maintain stability in your life. We want you to be able to focus on doing amazing things with us. That’s why you’ll find benefits that put your mind at ease — everything from medical insurance and retirement planning to adoption assistance and tuition reimbursement. 













        Professional Development
      


As Scripps has grown, so too have the opportunities. We’re offering jobs in cities all across the country where competition is stiff and our reputation helps us to attract the very best. One of the draws is every employee has access to invaluable professional development. This includes online learning, leadership training and opportunities for industry conferences.  













        Community Outreach
      


Community-focused storytelling is our passion, and the stories most important to our success are those lived every day by our employees. They give their time and energy to volunteer at community nonprofits or serve on boards. Our stations rally for annual events such as toy and food drives. Some broadcast telethons to benefit first responders while others take a stand against domestic violence. Our employees also leverage the generosity of the Scripps Howard Foundation for grants that empower each employee to contribute to their community in a way that is personal and meaningful.

Company







Vision
We create a better-informed world.

Mission
We do well by doing good - creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve.

Motto (since 1922)
Give light and the people will find their own way.


Scripps is a company where competing truths coexist.
We are proud of our long and rich history, but we stay fixated on the future.
We are creating digital media brands that complement and support our successful television and radio stations but also some that could compete with and disrupt them.
We employ accomplished journalists who have earned prestigious industry awards and have authority with audiences. But we’re also a band of contrarians who challenge the process and push ourselves to do new things.
We are obsessed with being right, but we’re not afraid to experiment and, occasionally, to fail.
We have a conservative financial ethos, but we use it to support an opportunistic and, at times, counterintuitive investing strategy.
We were birthed by newspapers, and we nurtured cable systems and cable networks. We loved them all, but we set them free.
We are comfortable with these kinds of disruptive ideas and contradictory facts. And that leads to a culture where our thriving broadcast business works side by side with emerging digital brands. Together these businesses create a financially attractive news and information company whose employees want to improve the circumstances of those we serve.

Original Programming
Rather than continue down the same path of renting programming from syndicators, Scripps has returned to its roots of content creation. Its first effort, to replace Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy with original shows, raised some eyebrows. But a foundation as content creators coupled with a certain amount of risk tolerance positioned Scripps to enjoy the rewards of building shows that are growing in popularity on a local and national scale. 





The List
The List is the Emmy Award-winning show featuring everything trending in social media in the form of a list. It is hosted by Kristina Guerrero, Donna Ruko and Jared Cotter. The List Weekend show includes host Teresa Strasser. There’s the news and then there’s The List.
The List is in its fifth season and is available in 45 markets, eight in the Nielsen Top 20. The show is airing across the day on ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX affiliates. 
The List content is available on multiple platforms through its broadcast production; its digital channel on OWNZONES.com; on the video network Gas Station TV; its website; and its mobile app, available for free download for iOS and Android devices.

Edward Willis Scripps,  (born June 18, 1854, near Rushville, Illinois, U.S.—died March 12, 1926, at sea off Monrovia, Liberia), newspaper publisher who, after founding his first paper in 1878, organized the first major chain of newspapers in the United States and later (1907) established the United Press.From 1872 Edward was employed by his half brother James Edmund Scripps (1835–1906) on newspapers in Detroit, Michigan. On November 2, 1878, he first published a paper of his own, the Cleveland (Ohio) Penny Press (afterward the Cleveland Press), and by 1887 he also controlled papers in St. Louis, Missouri; Detroit; and Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1894, with his half brother George H. Scripps and Milton Alexander McRae, he formed the Scripps-McRae League of Newspapers, and in 1909 he established another chain, the Scripps Coast League, comprising papers on the West Coast. Eventually he owned 34 newspapers in 15 states. Written for what he called the “95 percent” (i.e., ordinary people), his papers were low-priced, politically independent, liberal, and pro-labour. In 1922 he transferred his interests to his son Robert Paine Scripps, who with Roy W. Howard reorganized the papers into the Scripps-Howard chain.The Newspaper Enterprise Association, the first syndicate to supply feature stories, illustrations, and cartoons to newspapers, was founded by Scripps in 1902. Five years later he combined the Scripps-McRae Press Association (established 1897) with another news service to form the United Press, which later became United Press International after a merger with the Hearst organization’s International News Service in 1958.In 1903 Edward and his half sister Ellen Browning Scripps (1836–1932) founded the Marine Biological Station of San Diego (later called the Scripps Institution of Oceanography), and in 1926 she established Scripps College (for women) in Claremont, California.A mercurial man, Scripps was born with the given names Edward Willis but occasionally signed his middle name “Wyllis.”

Edward W. Scripps

From Ohio History CentralJump to:navigation, search



Edward Wyllis Scripps was a journalist and newspaper publisher.
Scripps was born in Rushville, Illinois in 1854. In 1873, he became a reporter for the Detroit Evening News. In 1878, Scripps moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he began his own newspaper, the Penny Press. Over the next several years, he acquired several additional newspapers.
In 1895, Scripps established the Scripps-McRae League with Milton McRae and his half-brother, George Scripps. The league consisted of a chain of newspapers owned by or affiliated with the Scripps brothers and McRae. The papers were liberal in their ideology and were major supporters of farmers and laborers against the government and large corporations. In 1907, Scripps established his own news service, the United Press Association. This organization sent reporters all around the world to report on news events instead of relying on reporters from other papers for information. Shortly after establishing the United Press Association, Scripps also created the Newspaper Enterprise Association. This organization provided Scripps's newspapers and other papers around the world with editorial cartoons, feature stories, and pictures.
Edward Scripps retired in 1922. His son, Robert P. Scripps, assumed control of the Scripps-McCrae League. In 1922, Robert Scripps joined with Roy Howard to form the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. 
Edward Scripps died in1926.

He began (1873) his career on the staff of the Detroit Evening News, a paper founded and edited by his half-brother James Edmund Scripps. His first independent venture was starting the Cleveland Penny Press (later the Press) in 1878. He purchased several additional papers and in 1895, with his manager, Milton A.

The Edward W. Scripps Trust ends

The Edward W. Scripps Trust, which has controlled The E.W. Scripps Company since the trust’s inception in 1922, ended yesterday upon the death of Robert P. Scripps, a grandson of the founder. He was the last of Edward W. Scripps’ descendants upon whom the duration of the trust was based. All of the assets of the trust, including Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares of The E.W. Scripps Company, will be distributed to certain descendants of E. W. Scripps. The company’s Class A Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SSP." There is no public market for the company’s other class of stock – Common Voting – which elects a majority of the company’s directors. As of Sept. 30, 2012, the trust owned 30.4 percent of the company’s outstanding 42.9 million Class A Common Shares and 89.6 percent of the outstanding 11.9 million Common Voting Shares. Together those shares represent 43 percent of the economic interest in the company. Certain surviving trust beneficiaries, and certain members of the John P. Scripps family and trusts for their benefit, are signatories to an agreement that governs the transfer of Common Voting Shares. The agreement, known as the Scripps Family Agreement, becomes effective with the trust’s termination. (John P. Scripps, an operator of West Coast-based newspapers was a grandson of Edward W. Scripps and a cousin of Robert P. Scripps.) Taken together shares held under the agreement represent approximately 98.5 percent of the Common Voting shares. The Scripps Family Agreement also sets forth a process for the family to vote its shares on company matters, including the election of directors. Three of E. W. Scripps’ great-grandchildren, Nackey E. Scagliotti, Mary M. Peirce and Paul K. Scripps, and Anne M. La Dow, a great-great granddaughter, currently serve as directors of the company. Mrs. Scagliotti is chairwoman of the board. The trust beneficiaries have been meeting annually since the early 1990s in preparation for the termination of the trust and the distribution of its assets. The distribution of the trust’s assets, however, will not occur immediately, pending customary legal proceedings. In 2011, the Trustees of the Trust filed a Petition for Instructions and Declaratory Relief with an Ohio Probate Court that seeks (i) to prepare for the administration of the Trust following its eventual termination, (ii) to determine the identities of named beneficiaries and the identities of others who may be entitled to distributions from the Trust, (iii) to authorize, subject to clause (iv) below, the Trustees to continue the investment and management of the Trust's assets during the period between Trust termination and final distribution of assets ("winding-up period"), (iv) to authorize the Trustees to vote the Common Voting Shares of the Company during the winding-up period in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Scripps Family Agreement and (v) to confirm the Trustees' views on a number of other issues.  The Petition was filed under seal in accordance with Ohio court rules, and the parties to the action are bound by a protective order issued by the Court that limits disclosure with respect to the proceedings. “Scripps and its shareholders have benefited from the continuity in leadership that The Edward W. Scripps Trust has provided these many years. Going forward, we anticipate a smooth transition in the control of the company and will rely on the support of our founder’s great-grandchildren to help us fulfill the company’s mission and strategic objectives,” said Rich Boehne, the company’s president and chief executive officer. “This is a difficult and emotional time for our family as the final member of our parents’ generation has passed into history,” said Mrs. Scagliotti. “The E.W. Scripps Company is a great, diverse media company. As a family, we support the company’s mission, editorial independence and commitment to excellence in its products and services. We believe that this Company has a great future and look forward to continuing the special relationship between our family and the company.” About Robert P. Scripps The eldest child of Robert Paine and Margaret Culbertson Scripps, Bob Scripps served as a director of The E.W. Scripps Company from 1949 until 1997, and was a long-time vice chairman of The Edward W. Scripps Trust. “Bob brought many decades of wisdom and guidance to The E.W. Scripps Company,” said Boehne. “He left an indelible stamp of quality and high standards on our enterprise, and his philanthropy has improved dozens of communities from coast to coast.” In addition to business leadership, Bob Scripps shared with his grandfather a love for the land that took root at Miramar, the 2,100-acre ranch in Southern California that was a home of Edward W. Scripps’ family. Bob Scripps cultivated his love of farming at Miramar Ranch, and continued it at his ranch home in Texas where he raised peaches and plums. Scripps started in the family business during the depression when he “ran calculators” at the Cincinnati headquarters for the same $20 per week paid to other beginners. He returned to Miramar in the late 1930s, and in 1941 he was drafted as a private in the Army infantry. Within days of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he shipped out of San Francisco for Guadalcanal, eventually serving in the Georgia Islands, the Solomon Islands and the Philippines. He was on a troop ship bound for home when the first atomic bomb was dropped. After the war, Scripps returned to farming, but he remained active in family businesses. He frequently traveled to Cincinnati for trustee and board meetings, including those of the Scripps Howard Foundation, on whose board he was a trustee emeritus. “More than just a generous philanthropist, Bob made his giving durable by helping us expand the reach and influence of our grants,” said Mike Philipps, president and CEO of the Scripps Howard Foundation. “His vision helped the foundation create the Community Fund, which improves the quality of life in communities where Scripps conducts business. Because of the broad outreach of the Community Fund, it would be impossible to count the many lives that have been improved because of Bob Scripps.” His other interests ranged from commercial beekeeping to steamboats, a side business begun decades ago when he started making steam engines that he sold to other hobbyists. He had his own steamboat on a lake near Fredericksburg, Texas, and he brought a 38-foot steam-powered sternwheeler up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to the first Tall Stacks steamboat gathering in Cincinnati in 1988. In 1948, Scripps married the former Mariana Rocha, who died in 2006. They had 11 children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. About The E.W. Scripps Company Scripps (www.scripps.com) is a leading media enterprise that embraces its rich history in delivering high-quality journalism through television stations, newspapers and the Scripps Howard News Service, while developing and expanding its digital strategies, including social gaming, for multiple platforms. The company provides community-changing breaking news, story-telling, investigations and interactive outreach at 19 television stations in major markets such as Denver, San Diego, Detroit, Phoenix, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Tampa, and 13 newspaper markets, including Memphis, Knoxville, Naples, Fla., and Corpus Christi, Texas. Since 1941, Scripps has operated the National Spelling Bee, one of America’s most-enduring celebrations of academic excellence.

Edward Willis "E.W." Scripps (June 18, 1854 – March 12, 1926), was an American newspaper publisher and founder of The E. W. Scripps Company, a diversified media conglomerate, and United Press news service. It became United Press International (UPI) when International News Service merged with United Press in 1958. The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University is named for him.

Early life[edit]
E. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) (1855 - 1937) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages.
E. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. He often signed his middle name as "Wyllis".[1]
Newspaper career[edit]
Both E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half-brother, James when he founded The Detroit News in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found The Penny Press (later the Cleveland Press) in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company.
E. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the most successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not "sell out," but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers.[citation needed]
In 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, later the UPI news service, from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said "I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press", to provide competition to the Associated Press.[citation needed]
Scripps believed in editorial independence, stating,

A newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class [the advertisers] which furnishes the larger part of a newspaper's income. It must occasionally so antagonize this class as to cause it not only to cease patronage, to a greater or lesser extent, but to make actually offensive warfare against the newspaper.[2]

Later life[edit]
In 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby,[3] thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of Illinois, but eventually lived there year round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate.
In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, later renamed Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps University is also named in his honor, since a large part of its endowment derives from his newspaper fortune.
Scripps became somewhat of a hermit, calling himself a "damned old crank." He enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht, smoking 50 cigars a day.[citation needed]
Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century.

Edward Willis "E.W." Scripps (June 18, 1854 – March 12, 1926), was an American newspaper publisher and founder of The E. W. Scripps Company, a diversified media conglomerate, and United Press news service. It became United Press International (UPI) when International News Service merged with United Press in 1958. The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University is named for him.

Early life[edit]
E. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) (1855 - 1937) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages.
E. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. He often signed his middle name as "Wyllis".[1]
Newspaper career[edit]
Both E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half-brother, James when he founded The Detroit News in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found The Penny Press (later the Cleveland Press) in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company.
E. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the most successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not "sell out," but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers.[citation needed]
In 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, later the UPI news service, from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said "I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press", to provide competition to the Associated Press.[citation needed]
Scripps believed in editorial independence, stating,

A newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class [the advertisers] which furnishes the larger part of a newspaper's income. It must occasionally so antagonize this class as to cause it not only to cease patronage, to a greater or lesser extent, but to make actually offensive warfare against the newspaper.[2]

Later life[edit]
In 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby,[3] thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of Illinois, but eventually lived there year round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.
In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate.
In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, later renamed Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps University is also named in his honor, since a large part of its endowment derives from his newspaper fortune.
Scripps became somewhat of a hermit, calling himself a "damned old crank." He enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht, smoking 50 cigars a day.[citation needed]
Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century.

About E. W. Scripps


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Scripps
Edward Willis Scripps (June 18, 1854 – March 12, 1926), was an American newspaper publisher and founder of The E. W. Scripps Company, a diversified media conglomerate, and United Press news service. It became United Press International (UPI) when International News Service merged with United Press in 1958. The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University is named for him.

Early life

E. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) (1855 - 1937) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages.

E. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. His middle name is often incorrectly written as Wyllis.

Newspaper career

Both E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half-brother, James when he founded The Detroit News in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found The Penny Press (later the Cleveland Press) in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company.

E. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not "sell out," but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers.

In 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, later the UPI news service, from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said "I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press", to provide competition to the Associated Press.

Scripps held a relatively unconventional view of the press, stating,

A newspaper fairly and honestly conducted in the interests of the great masses of the public must at all times antagonize the selfish interests of that very class [the advertisers] which furnishes the larger part of a newspaper's income. It must occasionally so antagonize this class as to cause it not only to cease patronage, to a greater or lesser extent, but to make actually offensive warfare against the newspaper.

Later life

In 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby, thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of Illinois, but eventually lived there year round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

In 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work.

In 1921, Scripps founded Science Service, later renamed Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science.

Scripps became somewhat of a hermit, calling himself a "damned old crank." He enjoyed sailing the seven seas on a yacht, smoking 50 cigars a day.

Scripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater in dance in America in the late 20th century.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
