If a customer requires set-ups on two different machines and makes 245 copies in total, how much cost would be assigned by the activity-based costing system for this transaction?$11.10When there are batch-level or product-level costs, in comparison to a traditional cost system, an activity-based costing system ordinarily will shift costs from...High-volume to low-volume productsProduct margin is a function of the...product's sales and the direct and indirect costs that the product causes.All of the following statements are correct except: a) the simplest absorption costing systems assign manufacturing overhead costs to products using a single factory-wide predetermined overhead rate. b) activity-based costing assign manufacturing overhead costs to products using a predetermined overhead rate for each activity cost pool.c) activity-based costing can also be used to develop product costs for external financial reports.d) activity-based costing information is used for decision-making.c) activity-based costing can also be used to develop product costs for external financial reports.All of the following statements are incorrect except: a) Instead of arbitrarily assigning various indirect costs to low-volume products, an activity-based costing system more accurately assigns these costs to the company's high-volume and low-volume products.b) Instead of arbitrarily assigning various indirect costs to high-volume products, an activity-based costing system more accurately assigns these costs to the company's high-volume and low-volume products. c) Instead of arbitrarily assigning various indirect costs to low-volume products, a traditional costing system more accurately assigns these costs to the company's high-volume and low-volume products. d) Instead of arbitrarily assigning various indirect costs to high-volume products, a traditional costing system more accurately assigns these costs to the company's high-volume and low-volume products.b) Instead of arbitrarily assigning various indirect costs to high-volume products, an activity-based costing system more accurately assigns these costs to the company's high-volume and low-volume products.Pedgrift Company uses an accounting system that charges costs to the manager who has been delegated the authority to make decisions concerning the costs. For example, if the sales manager accepts a rush order that will result in higher than normal shipping costs, these additional costs are charged to the sales manager because the authority to accept or decline the rush order was given to the sales manager.

One of the secrets to business success is pricing your products properly. Price your products correctly and that can enhance how much you sell, creating the foundation for a business that will prosper. Get your pricing strategy wrong and you may create problems that your business may never be able to overcome."It's probably the toughest thing there is to do," says Charles Toftoy, associate professor of management science at George Washington University. "It's part art and part science."There are a variety of different types of pricing strategies in business. However, there's no one surefire, formula-based approach that suits all types of products, businesses, or markets. Pricing your product usually involves considering certain key factors, including pinpointing your target customer, tracking how much competitors are charging, and understanding the relationship between quality and price. The good news is you have a great deal of flexibility in how you set your prices. That's also the bad news.The following pages will detail how to meet your business goals in pricing products, what factors to consider when pricing, and how to determine whether or raise or lower your prices.
Dig Deeper: How to Profit from Market ResearchHow to Price Your Products: Meeting Business GoalsGet Clear about Making MoneyThe first step is to get real clear about what you want to achieve with your pricing strategy: You want to make money. That's why you own a business. Making money means generating enough revenue from selling your products so that you can not only cover your costs, but take a profit and perhaps expand your business.The biggest mistake many businesses make is to believe that price alone drives sales. Your ability to sell is what drives sales and that means hiring the right sales people and adopting the right sales strategy. "The first thing you have to understand is the selling price is a function of your ability to sell and nothing else," says Lawrence L. Steinmetz, co-author of How to Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitors : Winning Every Sale at Full Price, Rate, or Fee (Wiley 2005) and a business consultant in Boulder, Colo. for 40 years. "What's the difference between an $8,000 Rolex and a $40 Seiko watch? The Seiko is a better time piece. It's far more accurate"¦. The difference is your ability to sell."At the same time, be aware of the risks that accompany making poor pricing decisions. There are two main pitfalls you can encounter - under pricing and over pricing.
 

Under pricing. Pricing your products for too low a cost can have a disastrous impact on your bottom line, even though business owners often believe this is what they ought to do in a down economy. "Accurately pricing your product is critical at any point in the economic cycle but no more so than in a recession," says Laura Willett, a small business consultant and faculty member in the finance department at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. "Many businesses mistakenly under price their products attempting to convince the consumer that their product is the least expensive alternative hoping to drive up volume; but more often than not it is simply perceived as 'cheap." Remember that consumers want to feel that they are getting their "moneys worth" and most are unwilling to purchase from a seller they believe to have less value, Willett says. Businesses also need to be very careful that they are fully covering their costs when pricing products. "Reducing prices to the point where you are giving away the product will not be in the firm's best interest long term," Willett says.
Over pricing. On the flip side, overpricing a product can be just as detrimental since the buyer is always going to be looking at your competitors pricing, Willett says.  Pricing beyond the customer's desire to pay can also decrease sales. Toftoy says one pitfall is that business people will be tempted to price too high right out of the gate. "They think that they have to cover all the expenses of people who work for them, the lease, etc. and this is what price it takes to do all that," he says. "Put yourself in the customer's shoes. What would be a fair price to you?" He advises taking little surveys of customers with two or three questions on an index-card-sized form, asking them whether the pricing was fair.

Understand Your Other Business PrioritiesThere are other reasons to go into business. Understand what you want out of your business when pricing your products. Aside from maximizing profits, it may be important for you to maximize market share with your product -- that may help you decrease your costs or it may result in what economists call "network effects," i.e. the value of your product increases as more people use it. (A great example of a product having network effect is Microsoft's Windows operating system. When more people began to use Windows over rival products, more software developers made applications to run on that platform.)You may also want your product to be known for its quality, rather than just being the cheapest on the market. If so, you may want to price your product higher to reflect the quality. During a downturn, you may have other business priorities, such as sheer survival, so you may want to price your products to recoup enough to keep your company in business.
Dig Deeper: How to Price Business Services
How to Price Your Products: Factors to Consider
"There are many methods available to determine the 'right' price," Willett says. "But successful firms use a combination of tools and know that the key factor to consider is always your customer first. The more you know about your customer, the better you'll be able to provide what they value and the more you'll be able to charge."Know Your CustomerUndertaking some sort of market research is essential to getting to know your customer, Willett says. This type of research can range from informal surveys of your existing customer base that you send out in e-mail along with promotions to the more extensive and potentially expensive research projects undertaken by third party consulting firms. Market research firms can explore your market and segment your potential customers very granularly -- by demographics, by what they buy, by whether they are price sensitive, etc.. If you don't have a few thousand dollars to spend on market research, you might just look at consumers in terms of a few distinct groups -- the budget sensitive, the convenience centered, and those for whom status makes a difference. Then figure out which segment you're targeting and price accordingly.Know Your CostsA fundamental tenet of pricing is that you need to cover your costs and then factor in a profit. That means you have to know how much your product costs. You also have to understand how much you need to mark up the product and how many you need to sell to turn a profit. Remember that the cost of a product is more than the literal cost of the item; it also includes overhead costs. Overhead costs may include fixed costs like rent and variable costs like shipping or stocking fees. You must include these costs in your estimate of the real cost of your product. "Come up with X first. X is your cost of raw materials, labor, rent, and everything it took to make the product so that if you sold it you would break even," advises Toftoy. "Y becomes what you think you need to make on it. That may depend on your business. Restaurants overall make about 4 percent, which is pretty low. If you want 10 percent then you factor that into your costs and that is what you charge."Many businesses either don't factor in all their costs and under price or literally factor in all their costs and expect to make a profit with one product and therefore overcharge. A good rule of thumb is to make a spread sheet of all the costs you need to cover every month, which might include the following:

Your actual product costs, including labor and the costs of marketing and selling those products.
All of the operating expenses necessary to own and operate the business.
The costs associated with borrowing money (debt service costs).
Your salary as the owner and/or manager of the business.
A return on the capital you and any other owners or shareholders have invested.
Capital for future expansion and replacement of fixed assets as they age.

List the dollar amount for each on your spreadsheet. The total should give you a good idea of the gross revenues you will need to generate to ensure you cover all those costs.Know Your Revenue Target You should also have a revenue target for how much of a profit you want your business to make. Take that revenue target, factor in your costs for producing, marketing, and selling your product and you can come up with a price per product that you want to charge. If you only have one product, this is a simple process. Estimate the number of units of that product you expect to sell over the next year. Then divide your revenue target by the number of units you expect to sell and you have the price at which you need to sell your product in order to achieve your revenue and profit goals.If you have a number of different products, you need to allocate your overall revenue target by each product. Then do the same calculation to arrive at the price at which you need to sell each product in order to achieve your financial goals.Know Your Competition It's also helpful to look at the competition -- after all, your customer most likely will, too. "Are the products offered comparable to yours?  If so, you can use their pricing as an initial gauge," Willett suggests. "Then, look to see whether there is additional value in your product; do you, for example offer additional service with your product or is your good of perceived higher quality?  If so, you may be able to support a higher price.  Be cautious about regional differences and always consider your costs."It may even be worthwhile to prepare a head-to-head comparison of the price of your product(s) to your competitor's product(s). The key here is to compare net prices, not just the list (or published) price. This information could come from phone calls, secret shopping, published data, etc. Make notes during this process about how your company and products -- and the competition -- are perceived by the market. Be brutally honest in your evaluation.Know Where the Market Is HeadedClearly you can't be a soothsayer, but you can keep track of outside factors that will impact the demand for your product in the future. These factors can range from something as simple as long-term weather patterns to laws that may impact future sales of your products. Also take into account your competitors and their actions. Will a competitor respond to your introduction of a new product on the market by engaging your business in a price war?
Dig Deeper: When Customers Grumble about Price Hikes
How to Price Your Products: Deciding to Raise or Lower Prices
One size does not fit all. You can only go so far pricing all your products based on a fixed markup from cost.  Your product price should vary depending on a number of factors including:

What the market is willing to pay.
How your company and product are perceived in the market.
What your competitors charge.
Whether the product is "highly visible" and frequently shopped and compared.
The estimated volume of product you can sell.

That opens the door to raising and/or lowering prices for your products. In order to make this call one way or the other, you should first understand what's already working. Analyze the profitability of your existing products, so you can do more of what works and stop doing what doesn't work. You want to find out which of your existing products are making money and which are losing money. You may be surprised at how many of your products are losing money -- fix those ASAP.You should also constantly re-evaluate your costs. To sell it right, you have to buy it right. If you are having a hard time selling a product at an acceptable profit, the problem may be that you are not buying the product right. It may be that your cost is too high rather than your price is too low.When to Raise Prices -- and HowYou should always be testing new prices, new offers, and new combinations of benefits and premiums to help you sell more of your product at a better price. Test new offers each month. Raise the price and offer a new and unique bonus or special service for the customer. Measure the increase or decrease in the volume of the product you sell and the total gross profit dollars you generate.It is a fact of life in business that you will have to raise prices from time to time as part of managing your business prudently. If you never raise your prices, you won't be in business for long. You have to constantly monitor your price and your cost so that you are both competitive in the market and you make the kind of money you deserve to make."The best way to determine if the product is being priced correctly is to watch sales volumes immediately after making any change," Willett says. "This can be done by watching cash collections (if the business is cash or credit card based) or credit sales (if accounts receivables are used) for the weeks following. If a price increase is too high, customers will react pretty quickly.  Also watching the competition can help - if you've made a positive change in prices; competitors are likely to follow suit."But there is a right way and a wrong way to raise prices. You don't want to alienate your existing customer base by raising prices too steeply, especially during a recession. "Rather than have a sudden increase, have a strategic plan over two to five years during which you gradually increase your price 5 to 10 percent," Toftoy advices. "If the business is in trouble and you say, 'Hey, I'm going to mark everything up"¦ that kind of scares people away. This way you haven't gone from $5 to $15. You've gone to $7.50 first.""In terms of raising the price -- this is more easily accepted in 'good' economic times," Willett says. "As the underlying cost of producing the product rises, the customer is prepared to accept the rise in the price to them.  If the customer perceives that the firm's costs are going down while their price is going up. This will not be received well and is likely to backfire."When to Lower Prices -- and HowYou may realize that you have missed your target audience by pricing your products too high. You can always choose to discount your products or give customers something for free in order to get them to try your product or generate traffic to your storefront or website. "You have to get people in," Toftoy says. "People like getting something for free or some kind of discount. You can make Wednesday senior citizen day when seniors get a 20 percent discount. Then maybe you can offer a student discount day. Then all you're doing is keeping the price the same, but to those people you're giving them a cut but it's not like you've lowered all prices."Generally, lowering prices is not a good practice unless you are using this strategically to garner market share and have a price sensitive product or if all of your competitors are lowering their prices, Willett says. "An alternative to lowering price is to offer less for the same price which will effectively reduce your costs without appearing to reduce the value to the customer," she says. "Restaurants have found this particularly helpful in terms of portion sizes but this same strategy can be applied to service industries as well."Monitor Your PricingAnother key component to pricing your product right is to continuously monitor your prices and your underlying profitability on a monthly basis. It's not enough to look at overall profitability of your company every month. You have to focus on the profitability (or lack of profitability) of every product you sell. You have to make absolutely sure you know the degree to which every product you sell is contributing to your goal of making money each month. Remember: "People respect what you inspect."Here are some other practices to help you price right:

Listen to your customers. Try to do this on a regular basis by getting feedback from customers about your pricing. Let them know you care about what they think.
Keep an eye on your competitors. If you don't have deep pockets and can't afford to hire a market research team, hire some college students to go out on a regular basis and monitor what your competitors are doing.
Have a budget action plan in place. Try to have a plan for your pricing that extends out three to six months in the future.

You owe it to yourself and to your business to be relentless in managing your product pricing. Remember, how you set the price of the products could be the difference between the success -- or failure -- of your business.

5 Things to Consider When Expanding Your Product Categories

The age old question that keeps many an entrepreneur up at night is whether to expand into new categories or if you should stick to what has already proven successful. There is compelling research for larger companies that seems to indicate that in most cases keeping your product assortment within a narrow band of what you know is best over time. (HBR Article- Jan/Feb 2013 - The Grass isn't Greener - Evan Hirsh and Kasturi Rangan). For smaller businesses that are starting out or just hitting their growth stride, I wish the answer was as clear cut. I find that the answer always depends and truly can change based on individual circumstances. As such here are 5 things to think about when considering if and how far to expand your product category breadth.Do you have a natural right to win - Is it logical for you to offer it. Meaning will your customers' understand and believe you are credible in that category? At The Tie Bar, we have expanded into other men's accessories such as socks and belts with great success. We probably could expand into offering other men's products down the line but it wouldn't seem logical for us to move into accessories that are marketed primarily to women. You should always know your overall brand standards and stick to them.Do you have the right knowledge - Just because the product makes sense in an internal brainstorm doesn't mean you can always pull it off without hurting your overall brand or customer experience. Testing and learning is a great way to figure this out, as is hiring an expert in that area to help lead your expansion. Don't underestimate the learning curve when developing and launching into a new product category. Practice makes perfect and won't always immediately pan out the way you want it to.Does it complement your current business - Can you leverage aspects of your current business like selling to your core customer base, utilizing your existing supply chain, or promoting on your existing retail channels and platforms?Do you really understand the economics - New categories present opportunities to grow and learn. However, you need to make sure you really understand the economics of the new category. Will you be able to make sufficient margin and dollar profit? As an example, when The Tie Bar considers the possibility of expanding into other men's product areas, we need to consider the economics of a much higher return rate than ties. Factors like fit in relation to the overall customer satisfaction and the added cost to either liquidate a return or recondition for future sale must be taken into consideration.Do you need to pivot/expand to survive--Some-times you are just in a dying business and you need to pivot and add new categories to survive. Consider the example of the old bankrupted horse and carriage manufacturers who should have realized they were in the transportation business and not the buggy business. Or in more recent times the folks like Blockbuster Video or Borders that could have pivoted into new categories when they had the chance but missed their opportunity and only suffered for it.If these types of decisions were easy or obvious you could follow a prescribed formula or checklist. We would not need smart entrepreneurs and leaders to grow and build our businesses for many years to come. My tips above are just the top 5 that I personally consider and the tip of the iceberg for this debate. I am curious what other factors you consider as you face a similar challenges and welcome your thoughts now.

Vendor & Product Compliance
Product quality and safety has always been a priority for Barnes & Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Barnes & Noble”). Barnes & Noble requires all suppliers to stand fully behind their products. We depend on you to maintain knowledge of and comply with all safety standards for your products. To that extent, we have developed a Vendor and Product Compliance program to ensure that we continue to provide high quality, safe products to our customers.
All suppliers, manufacturers and other vendors (collectively, “Vendors”) of Barnes & Noble and its subsidiaries and affiliates must comply with the Barnes & Noble Vendor Guidelines. By supplying Barnes & Noble with products, Vendors agree to be bound by all Barnes & Noble Vendor Requirements, as each of the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time. All books will be considered for store placement based on subject matter and salability.
Please consider the following points when publishing and presenting your book: 






                Publishing & Presenting Your Book            



1. Does your book have an ISBN (International Standard Book Number)?


2. Does your book have a bar code?


3. What sort of binding is your book (Trade Paperback, Hardcover, Audiobook, etc.)?


4. Is your book available through a wholesaler?


5. Is your book priced competitively with other titles of a similar topic and quality?


6. Why should Barnes & Noble place your title on its shelves?


7. What if there's an error in a title listing?


 8. Where can you find more information on the topic of book writing, publishing, and marketing?




1. Does your book have an ISBN (International Standard Book Number)?


We use the ISBN to track inventory and sales information. An ISBN is a 13-digit number that specifically identifies your title. For further information, please see Barcoding Guidelines for the U.S. Book Industry on the Book Industry Study Group site. ISBNs are furnished by:
ISBN Agency
 630 Central Avenue
 New Providence, NJ 07974
 877-310-7333
 908-219-0188 (fax)
www.ISBN.org
Allow 5 business days for non-priority processing from the time an ISBN application is received at the agency (not from the date sent by the publisher). Priority processing is two business days from the time an application is received at the agency. Express processing is 24 business hours. If your book has already been printed, you can sticker your books with the ISBN once it is assigned. The ISBN and price should appear on the back cover of the book. 




2. Does your book have a bar code?


Bar codes help our stores handle books more efficiently. The bar code which incorporates your ISBN is scanned at the time of purchase, thus recording accurately the sale of your book. The book industry uses the Bookland EAN bar code, not the UPC. The barcode must have the U.S. retail price of the book embedded in it and printed on it. If your book is already printed, you can have pressure-sensitive labels produced for placement on the back cover. For a list of commercial bar code suppliers, please see Labels & Barcodes on the Book Industry Study Group site. 




3. What sort of binding is your book (Trade Paperback, Hardcover, Audiobook, etc.)?


For a complete listing of formats, please review the most recent version of the ONIX code lists at www.editeur.org/14/code-lists/#code. Since most of the titles in our stores are placed on the shelves spine out, we require both the title and author be printed on the spine of the book. 




4. Is your book available through a wholesaler?


Placing your book with a wholesaler/distributor will simplify your billing (one invoice to one location). It also allows B&N to consider placing larger orders and putting the book on automatic replenishment.
Wholesalers/distributors are used by many segments of the book industry: publishers, libraries and booksellers. Other bookstores order from the same wholesalers Barnes & Noble uses. We can help put you in touch with an appropriate wholesaler. 




5. Is your book priced competitively with other titles of a similar topic and quality?


Customers care about cost. Price can be a determining factor for a customer when looking at books similar in content, presentation and format. Look at the pricing of similar books in the category, and try to price yours competitively. 




6. Why should Barnes & Noble place your title on its shelves?


Tell us what makes your book unique or special. What is your marketing plan? Send us your publicity and promotional plans, along with any reviews or articles that may have been written about your book(s). 




7. What if there's an error in a title listing?


If you detect an error in a title listing, please email corrections@bn.com. Be sure to include the ISBN of the book. We receive a lot of copy that does not reference a specific ISBN, and this copy cannot be processed.
To add text content (descriptive content, author bios), email the information to titles@bn.com. Please include the ISBN with no dashes in the “Subject” line. For cover images, email a jpeg of the image to imagesinquiry@book.com. For more information about how to share content, please visit here. 




 8. Where can you find more information on the topic of book writing, publishing, and marketing?


The reference shelf in your favorite bookstore or local library features a wide variety of titles about writing books and the business of publishing.

 Price Guide
I am working up a price guide for the more common Willett pieces. Since prices vary
a lot at auctions and between auctions and retailers, these numbers are at best educated guesses on my part
as to value. But that is true of any collectible price guide. If you have comments on the prices or
additional information about prices of specific pieces, please drop me a note at
DLDebertin@aol.com and I will try my best to incorporate your information into the guide.
This price guide is stored as a Microsoft Exel spreadsheet (file type xls), so you will need a copy of Excel or
another
spreadsheet program that can read Exel files in order to view this.

The Consider H. Willett Company of Louisville, Kentucky

 When have you ever made a better investment?--from a tag on a Willett furniture piece

I am a Kentucky Transplant and what I know about Willett
furniture is based on what local people have told me.

The Consider H. Willett Furniture company was located in
Louisville, Kentucky, and I believe made furniture  from the late
30s into the 60s.  The furniture was at the peak of popularity from the
late 40s into the early and mid 50s.

Deep cherry furniture never seems to go out of fashion in the
Southeast. A lot of Willett furniture was sold in Central
Kentucky, and it sold quite well in the comparatively wealthy
Bluegrass region, At Central Kentucky auctions, the name
Willett is well recognized, and the pieces probably command
higher prices than in states further north, where the furniture is
not as well known and there is less of a following.

The furniture was never cheap. It was manufactured furniture
rather than hand-made, but the pieces were always very
carefully crafted, and were made of solid hardwoods, most often
cherry but sometimes in maple as well. A piece of, say, 
cherry furniture from Willett was made of solid cherry inside
and out--no veneers, plywood, particle board or any other cheap
material even in interior places like drawer pieces. They were
also famous for their hand-rubbed finishes, particularly on cherry, which
often gave a glass-like polished but almost three-dimensional
transparent depth to the wood, rather than appearing as a finish on the top of the wood, unlike 
many of the finishes now appearing on newly-made cherry furniture.

Many pieces have a pressed metal medallion on them identifying
them as Willett and what particular design line they are from,
for example, my buffet, drop leaf table and chairs are from the
"Wildwood" line, which, if the pieces coming up for sale are
any indication, was by far the most popular, and became the "trademark"
collection. Some of the maple pieces apparently 
were also tagged. The "Golden Beryl" marking was often used on the maple pieces.

The "trademark" cherry line featured what is often referred to as a "rope"
motif, which was a spiral
carving that appeared on drop-leaf table legs, as trim on the sides of
buffets, chests and vanities,
and even on horizontal pieces on poster beds, dining chairs and benches.
The vanity illustrated in the photo below
illustrates the many different ways in which the spiral rope motif
appeared on some furniture pieces.
I am convinced that early on, this was basically the only design Willett
used for their cherry furniture pieces, and
these pieces are generally tagged as "Wildwood."
Wildwood pieces with drawers (buffets, dressers and similar) often have a metal plate with
the Wildwood name attached to the inside of one of the drawers.
 Some of the pieces also have the Willett name
stamped with red ink as illustrated here. 
My dropleaf table has a large Willett Wildwood marking stamped with red ink on
the underside of the center of the top. Chairs often bear no marking at all. Upholstered chairs probably had a paper
tag stapled underneath,
but these tags were usually removed when the chair fabric was changed.

 Later on, into the late 50s.
the company added other collections with
some
different styling themes. These moved away from the rope motif. But the
rope motif furniture was still being
manufactured, and that furniture ultimately became the "Wildwood
collection."
But the confusing part is that some of the pieces that do not have the same trim
details as those that used the rope turnings still were labeled
Wildwood and some even have the metal Wildwood tag (see photos of markings below).

 In cherry the other collections included Elswick,
Marblehead, Transitional, Trans-East and Countryside. There were a
smaller number of collections in Maple, the
Golden Beryl, Brownleigh, and the Lancaster County Collection are mentioned in
advertisements. There are fewer pieces of Willett furniture now coming
up for
sale in these other designs in part because they never reached the
popularity of the original rope motif design, but
also because these other collections were manufactured for a much
shorter period of time, late in the history of the
company. For example, an ad below introduces the new "Transitional"
collection in a 1957 Better Homes and
Gardens. By 1964, the company was out of business. In contrast, the
company was producing the rope motif design with the Wildwood logo
basically from the start (1934) to the point in time when the company
was liquidated. Also, given the relative
numbers of pieces now up for auction, the maple furniture was never
anywhere near as popular as the cherry pieces. 

But the labeling becomes even more complex. Rebecca Beatty tells me
that her newly-acquired pewter cabinet, photo below, despite not having
the rope design trim, and having a different style of door panel (I call it
the sway-top design) than the rope motif pieces have, still is labeled
"Willett Wildwood." My guess is that this piece was made sometime
between 1952 and 1956. Apparently it was only rather late in the
company history that the Wildwood name became one specific collection
with the rope motif. 

Ladies from well-to do Kentucky families( and throughout the South) in
the 40s and 50s
loved to buy Willett pieces to blend in with antique and family
pieces passed down through the generations and the cherry pieces were
the logical choice. Kentucky women
(and for that matter, many women in the South) have long
favored dark cherry furniture in traditional styles, even when it
was out of favor in other parts of the country, and so that often
constituted much of their business.

The pieces today aren't ultra expensive, but prices appear to be
rising.  A few years ago I purchased the large sideboard/buffet
with the "rope" motif at a local antiques dealer for $750. When
I got it home and could look at the condition and construction
quality I concluded that I had gotten quite a bargain. Rebecca Beatty tells me she
saw the same buffet at the Louisville Antiques mall in excellent original condition.
The asking price was $1995.  In October, 2001, I completed a deal with a lady in Fort Wayne Indiana
for the drop leaf table with the rope legs, 4 side chairs and two
arm chairs, for $1,400. The table and chairs are also in excellent
condition and the finish is so close to the finish on the buffet, it could have come
out of the factory on the same day,
This lady also had a china cabinet that is wider than the tall
hutch, which is also cherry and marked Willett. Its design, in a photo
below, does not have the rope motif but is
consistent with one of the other collections.


Just before this, I went to the local auction house, where the
drop leaf table also in excellent condition was bid to $1,000 and
6 roseback side chairs went for $225 each. They also sold the rope motif
tall hutch which was bid to $1,200. What is interesting is that
the auctioneer estimated the drop leaf table to bring $500-600
and each chair to bring $125-$150. He was off by a factor of
almost 2!

Swains Furniture in southern Illinois (a company that sells on
ebay) has a Wildwood cherry rope motif set consisting of the
drop leaf table, 6 side chairs, two arm chairs, the tall hutch and
the buffet identical to mine that they would be willing to sell for
$3,500 tho as of the last auction there have been no takers at
this price. The pieces appear to be in good but not excellent
condition. 

Another ebay seller in New England recently had a very
beautiful pristine arch window cherry corner cupboard, marked
Willett Wildwood. This sold on ebay for $860.

The cherry rope-leg drop-leaf tables must have been very popular with
buyers and apparently more of these were made than any other Willett
item.  
A drop-leaf dining room table should bring between $500 and $1000--perhaps
even more--at a sale depending on whether the finish is original or not
and the overall condition of the table. Willett was a master finisher of
Cherry, and a considerable portion of the value of any Willett piece is in
this original finish. If the finish is not original, the value would be in the
lower end of this range, perhaps $500-$750. An original finish table in
near-pristine condition should be worth at least $1,000. Regardless of the
piece, having the original finish represents perhaps 40 % (maybe more)
of the value of the piece. Small nicks and scratches on the original finish
do not seriously detract from value, but a non-original finish does.  

The fact that many antique dealers buy Willett
pieces at estate sales tells  something about what is happening with
respect to collector interest. I have seen Willett Cherry
finished in a lighter cherry finish that is more golden rather than
deep red. I am not certain if this was a factory finish, however.

My drop leaf table and the one on Swains has a 15 inch leaf and
a cut in the middle of the table to accept the leaf. The leaf I
have for mine is still in the original Willett cardboard box with
a large Willett logo on it. The table auctioned locally had a one-
piece center and no leaf, but otherwise are identical in size and
in design. These tables without he cut for the leaf have also been
regularly auctioned on ebay.

So far, I have seen or heard of six or seven different chair designs as
illustrated 
in the photos below, and I am
interested in learning if there are others as well. The back
designs differ considerably. Most of them are of modest size, with
fairly low backs. Some of the chair designs have the rope motif--others
do not. The chairs at the local auction were the so-
called "rose" chairs, with a large carved rose an the top of the
back. My chairs look more contemporary and have no carving or rope
trim, but
the center slat is in the shape of a vase or urn. The arm chairs
have curved arms, with a spiral. The backs on the Swain chairs
appear to be more of a lyre shape--with a decorative hole cut
in the middle of the center slat. I would describe this as a decorative
"Lyre back"
 I am confident that all of these chair designs are genuine Willett
(see photos below). 

There are at least 3 chair designs that feature the rope motif. One has the rope
pattern on the top horizontal slat. Another design features a small
padded back, with a horizontal slat featuring the rope motif below. 
Still another design features the rope motif on the legs.
These
chairs are illustrated in the photos below. These were 
undoubtedly the chairs designed to go with the drop leaf and other
pieces with the rope motif. But
interestingly, most of the buyers appear to have chosen one of the other
chair
designs as they are more often seen at sales.

Apparently, buyers, having chosen the table, would then choose from
a number of different chair designs to suit their particular preferences.
 I am wondering if there are
still other chair designs out there that were sold with the drop
leaf table. A photo below shows a chair design with a mixture of 
Windsor and Early American influences, and the owner claimed that
these chairs were
also manufactured by Willett. Another writer tells me that she also
has Willett chairs of a very similar design. These may be part of the
Marblehead collection
as illustrated in the brochure, below.

Sue Hayes writes 

"I bought a table (does not accept an extra leaf), a sideboard/buffet
(without the rope inserts) and a piece that was described by the sellers
as a Jackson Press. It has the rope inserts on each side and doors toward
the bottom with drawers above.  I also bought a serving cart and a wall
mirror that has Willett Wildwood cherry on the back.  There was a
printed card in one of the buffet drawers that had Consider H. Willett,
Inc., Louisville 11, Kentucky on it.  It described a little of their
manufacturing process and the care that should be given to the furniture. 
It ended with the question 'When have you ever made a better
investment?'... I have been able to verify that the table and all of the
chairs are indeed stamped "Willett" and the name of the grouping is
'Countryside'. "


And, from the new owner of the coffee table pictured below
"I recently purchased a Willett cherry double size poster bed in
Colorado through a classified ad.  I liked the quality and workmanship
and looked for the brand when I was on ebay one day.  I am the one
that purchased the drop leaf coffee table from Cairnes that you have on
your website.  Also, I was very close to bidding on the corner cabinet.

Comment:I suspect that the coffee table, the Windsor/Early American
chairs and the Oval Drop Leaf table are all from the "Countryside"
collection which was a different collection from the furniture that 
used the spiral "rope" motif


While the pieces can't be classified as antiques, they still are
very fine and functional pieces of furniture and worthy of
passing through the generations. The furniture seems to be
acquiring its own collector-following--people who are not
concerned that it isn't old enough to be considered antique, and
who simply value the furniture for its beauty and construction
quality.

 A Little Willett History
I am indebted to Charles Hudson of Nicholasville, Kentucky, who
has provided some details about the history of the Willett Furniture
company in Kentucky, based on clippings from Louisville Courier Journal
Newspapers during the era.

From the August 8, 1947 issue:
Consider H. Willett and his brother  W.R Willett were in the lumber
business when in 1934 Consider H. founded the 
Willett Furniture Co.  They were at the time of this writing 
the largest maker of cherry and maple furniture in the US.  the article
gives a profit for the year 1946 of 2,600,000. dollars. 

By 1947 standards, this would have been a very successful company in
terms of size, earnings and profit.  
 
In 1949 they bought a plant in New Albany, Ind. for the manufacture of
Kitchen cabinets.  These were done in birch. Charles says he has only
talked to one person who had these.  and he doubts if there 
are very many left intact. Apparently, the kitchen cabinet business was
less successful than the furniture business.  

Charles indicates to me that the firm got into serious financial difficulty
in about 1960, and between 1960 and 1964 the company changed hands
in an effort to save the firm.

Assets of the Willett firm were auctioned in June 1964 and the firm
ceased operation at that time.  Charles indicates that the furniture
manufacturing equipment was simply sold off to bidders at the auction,
and that the detailed production drawings for each furniture piece were
also auctioned off. He believes that the drawings ended up in the hands
of a furniture manufacturer somewhere in the Eastern United States, but
so far as anyone knows, no other manufacturer has attempted to continue
to produce any of the pieces.

At least as of the year 2000, the old Willett factory 
is still standing. It is on the corner of 30th and Kentucky 
in Louisville,  The Willett name was still 
legible on the side of the brick.  

Charles also says...
The tag that came on 
our buffet says that it is "My Old Kentucky Home" group.  This is the 
one with all the roped legs and turnings on the sides.  The 1948 book 
lists three groupings of Cherry:  'My Old Kentucky Home',(Dining 
Room);'Sallie Ward Group' (Living Room )  and 'The Kentuckiana Group' ( 
Bed Room)  The Maple is not named in groupings.  In the dining room 
grouping there are four styles of chairs.



I suspect what brought Willett down was a combination of
several factors--like many family-run businesses there might not
have been another generation committed to keeping the business
operational and as the company changed hands, new owners may not
have fully appreciated what was involved. Though manufactured, the
furniture pieces required careful craftsmanship with lots of skilled hand
work by what must have been becoming a very well-paid work-force.
Perhaps The
careful craftsmanship, materials & finish became less and less
competitive price-wise with cheaper furniture constructed less
carefully (often in other countries with cheaper labor costs) and of lesser
materials, and this could have led to a decline in sales. Finally, by
the late 50s the trend was definitely away from heavy dark
traditional furniture, as many people were tossing traditional furniture in
favor of simple new contemporary designs with blonde finishes. Time-
wise, the early 60s was certainly a low point in interest in traditional
furniture with a lot of detail. Somehow, the attempts to contemporize the 
furniture by eliminating details never quite worked with customers
(see photos of Transitional and the somewhat oriental-looking Trans-East line, below). 
The company
still really wanted to make traditional furniture like they had in the past. The
late designs came off as neither traditional nor contemporary, but some place in between.
Perhaps the pieces were too modern looking for the traditional buyers, but not
contemporary enough for those who were purchasing new furniture in the late 50s and 
early 60s. 

Another clue is that the ads for Willett furniture that are showing up at auction are
almost always from the late 50s, as the BH&G ad introducing the Transitional line.
I think this says something. Previously  the traditional furniture may have been so popular that the company's major
problem probably was keeping up with the demand, especially given the complicated multi-step finishing process
that required skilled labor. Word of mouth worked better than any print advertizing campaign. By the late 50s, sales
of the traditional pieces were declining--hence all the new almost contemporary designs that appeared in the late
50s. But the company also found it necessary to advertize in national magazines in an effort to boost sales--
something they had hardly done in the 40s and early 50s   

I had the following note from Margaret Willett Ernest, a relative of
Consider H. Willett.
====================================================

From the book, "Abraham Willett of Onondaga County, New York" by
Albert James Willett, Jr., on p. 212:  "The
Willett Furniture Company was eventually sold out of the family, but
continued under the Willett name until at least
1959.  It went out of business in the 1960s."

Earlier, on the same page, the author said that it was a going concern in
1941.  Consider Heath Willett, Jr. died in 1944.

Sincerely,
Margaret Willett Ernest
===================================================

I'm still trying to determine if the person who died in 1944 was indeed
the founder or perhaps instead a son who could have died in World War
II, and if anyone has any more information on this I would appreciate
hearing from them.
 From owners of Willett Golden Beryl Maple pieces 
 Chuck Holm in Green Bay, Wisconsin writes 

Greetings, David - I just discovered your website and am so thrilled to
find other collectors of Willett! I am of the "other" family - I have
Golden Beryl Maple. I grew up with this furniture, and was always told
of it's quality. I have redone my family room to look just like the living
room of my childhood - with all the 1949 maple. I have the long drop
dining room table, hutch, corner cabinet, coffee table, dropleaf end table,
and have just found a wonderful little writing desk. My dining table and
end table are in mint condition - not a single scratch. I have a clock
shop in Green Bay, Wisconsin we sell Restore-a-finish products by
Howard - I love them - better than Old English Scratch cover. I have
many collector cars and have a professional buffer, and I took this to the
top of the tables - they came out beautiful - a mirror finish - hard to
believe for 50 year old pieces. The coffee table was another story -
really in bad shape - was in the basement for kids to play on with their
toys. I had to refinish it - but spent many hours using red oak stain and
sprayed coats of hand rubbed lacquer to get it to look like the original
finish. It isn't easy! 


 Anyway, I would appreciate any information or leads on the Golden
Beryl Maple - I saw two '40's Willett catalogs go on Ebay last year -
was that you who got them? I was hoping that someone would have the
same information on the maple as you have on the cherry. 


  I would love to communicate with you more on the Willett - it has
been a hobby of mine for many years to search it out in the antique
malls, auctions, etc. It would be fun to share "stories" with others. And
thanks for your wonderful website- Chuck Holm, Green Bay, Wisconsin

Connie Conley Noyes writes ...
I recently discovered that the beautiful table set my husband's
grandmother
gave us was made by Willett.  I searched the internet for information on
this furniture brand and your informative page came up.  The set has a
total
of 6 chairs, Grandmother still has the two that she calls Captain chairs
as
she is using them.  The set is made of Solid maple with golden beryl
stamped
under the extra leaves and the chairs.  When it is all put together it
makes
a very large table to accommodate several people, however, long legged
people complain about there being too many table legs; they can't
comfortably fit their legs underneath.  The total counted is ten legs!
I can't find any stamping that will provide information on the style.  I
will take a photo of this furniture and once the film is developed,
forward
you the picture via email.

I am writing to thank you for the help you have provided me with the
background of this furniture company.  I intend to clean and polish it by
the directions mentioned in your web page.  Thank you very much for
them.  I
was concerned about some nicks, it had been stored in the attic of a
house
in Illinois that my husbands grandparents lived in.

It was very exciting to learn that it was crafted in Kentucky.  My
paternal
line comes from that fine state, for several generations.

Jackie Whitney writes ...

I recently purchased a dining set at a resale shop with the Consider H.
Willett label. It is a drop leaf table with 6
chairs one with arms. I was concerned with the fact that there is a
cigarette burn on the top. Should I try and
remove it or just leave it? I think it has its original finish. All the pieces
have labels and are numbered. I am sending
pictures feel free to display them on your site. Thank you for your time.


The pictures of the dining set are in the photos below.

I reply...

There are antique furniture restorers who specialize in dealing with
small problems such as nicks, scratches and
cigarette burns.  I do not view these small problems as significantly
detracting from the value of the piece if the
finish is original and overall is in good condition. If you do decide to
have a repair made, what you want is someone
who can make a small repair to just the immediate area of the cigarette
burn without altering the finish on the rest
of the piece. Check your phone directory for furniture repair people
particularly people  who specialize in repair
of antique furniture, and see what type of repair they might suggest.
Remember that as much as 40% of the value
of your furniture is in the original finish, so you will want whatever
repairs are made to not affect the finish on the
rest of the piece, even if the spot from the burn cannot be completely
eliminated.

I had a nice phone visit with Barry Goodall, who is one of 
the dealers who buys and sells Willett furniture
at the Louisville Antiques Mall (http://www.louisvilleantiquesmall.com)
He reinforced a couple of points with me:
1. With Willett furniture, condition largely determines value, and having 
the original finish in nearly unblemished condition makes a piece much more 
valuable than having a non-original finish, even a non-original finish in good
condition.

2. Maple pieces are worth considerably less than cherry pieces of similar condition. There is less Maple out there,
but there are far fewer buyers looking for maple pieces. A Dropleaf table in Maple
might be worth $4-500 retail whereas the same table in cherry would 
likely bring $750-$1000 retail.

Barry is always interested in buying and selling Willett furniture, or just
visiting with people about Willett furniture. He has a number of the old 
Willett dealer catalogs, and can identify many of the pieces with respect to what collection they belong and 
He can be reached at (502) 245-9841.

Cherry Collections

I know of the following cherry collections built by Willett. Each
differs in some details.
Wildwood:
This collection was built for a very long time and, as a result, the pieces
are among the most readily 
available. The most distinguishing feature is the rope, or spiral, rather
than turned design that appears on table legs, as trim on buffets,
dressers, and as a feature on beds and horizontal chair slats. It's the
design most commonly thought of as "Willett". The drawers in this
design features brass handles with backplates and the doors have panels
with a single curved arch on the top.

Marblehead:
The rope motif in this collection is absent, and the door panels are
square rather than cathedral. I'm still trying to determine for certain if
the fingerboard trim appears on Marblehead buffets where the rope trim
would appear on the Wildwood collection. Legs on tables are ordinary--
not spiral--turnings.

Elswick:
The large breakfront in the photo below was identified as being part of
the Elswick collection. The design is similar to the Transitional line,
with rectangular panels in the doors. One difference is the queene anne
foot on the buffet, whereas the Transitional buffet had a short turned leg
with a taper. There are handles with backer plates on the drawers.
Interestingly, a grooved fingerboard-like  piece appears in place of the
rope trim on the buffet.

Transitional
This is the collection illustrated in the BH&G ad, above. The legs are
a simple variable radius turning, and round pulls are used on both
drawers and pulls.

Trans-East: A recently had a call from a man in Louisville who owns
Trans-East pieces, and the photos are now on the Web Site. The design is similar 
to the Transitional, with different, somewhat Oriental-looking brass pulls and trim.


Countryside:
I have no information on design features of this collection.

In the photos below, there are two mystery designs that are likely from one
of the above collections. The table and Jackson Press owned by Sue
Hayes features a leg and trim design that is somewhat like the rope leg,
but is different too. This is sometimes referred to as button trim. Further, the Jackson Press has a rectangular flat
rather than a raised-panel door. 

The other design features what I call the sway-back door panel. The top
of the panel is curved but like the sway-back of a horse. I suspect all of
the pieces featuring this design belong to another of
the above collections, but which one, I don't now know. Please e-mail
me if you know anything about this.
Obviously, all of the pieces that have the door panels with the double sway.
 Maple Collections
I know of the following maple collections (see photos below).

Golden Beryl

Lancaster County

Brownleigh (no photos, yet)

 More Willett ads
Here are some PDF files of Willett ads to download, sent to me by Jim Morrow.
Jim writes..."In November 1956, my wife and I were in the market to purchase  
furniture for our apartment which we had rented furnished with rental  
furniture.  Our tastes were different, but after looking around we  
both agreed that we liked the Willett Transitional Cherry.  We  
purchased living room, dining room and bed room pieces which I still  
have in my possession.  Only one piece that we purchased has been  
disposed of in over 52 years.  I was in the military and we made  
numerous moves over the years both during and after my retirement.   
Aside from short moves of 400 - 500 miles, it has been shipped to  
Puerto Rico, England and back, and from East to West coast and back,  
and is still in great shape with only minor scuff marks and dings.   
None of it has ever been refinished.  I consider it a real tribute to  
the manufacturer that it has held up so well, and to the movers for  
the care they showed in handling it."


"In 2000, we downsized from a large home to an apartment and had to  
dispose of some furniture.  We disposed of Willett Piece No. 557, a  
62" x 20" Coffee Table - Bench which came with three cushions so that  
it could be used as a coffee table without the cushions, or a  
cushioned bench for seating.  Disposal was through an auction house.   
The bench without the cushions went for $5.00.  The cherry wood in the  
piece was worth more than that, and it would have still been an  
excellent piece of cherry furniture with very little work."

"After Willett went out of business we were forced to get our cherry  
furniture from Harden Furniture and Pennsylvania House, but the  
Willett has always had a special place in our home."

 Caring for Your Willett Furniture
I am getting questions on how to care for Willett Furniture, in
particular, how to deal with chips and scratches.
Appreciation is extended to Sue Hayes  of Dickson, Tennessee, who also

supplied me with a copy of the original care tag from a piece of her
Willett furniture. Below are the actual care instructions from the
company when the furniture was delivered.



The first paragraph talks a bit about the manufacturing process that
resulted in the famous Willett finish, which is a hand-rubbed finish.
Perhaps most interesting is the admonition to use a paste wax, rather
than an oil-based polish. Undoubtedly a paste wax was used in the final
stages of finishing at the manufacturing plant.

 The problem with paste waxes is that they can build up over time,and
collect grime, leaving a sticky residue that must eventually be removed.
A lemon oil polish or similar furniture cleaner will remove this buildup,
and i have not observed any harm to the underlying finish. The factory
finish, being 50 years old, has had lots of time to harden and cure, and
the prime condition of many Willett pieces attests to the long-tern
durability of the finish even for those who failed to heed all the advice
in the above tag. 


Remember that Willett was a master furniture finisher, and the
envy of many other manufacturers in this regard. Thus, a considerable
share of the value of your Willett piece is in the original finish, which
would be difficult for a refinisher to duplicate.

Furniture that is 50 years or more old should show some evidence that
it did not just come out of a furniture store. This means that small nicks,
scratches and other wear marks accumulated over time do not detract
from value, at least not in any significant way. As a general rule, the
older the piece of furniture, the more wear marks will have been
accumulated. Many furniture manufacturers today are trying for the look
that their recently manufactured pieces are not new but instead have
been passed down through the generations. 

Often times, furniture accumulates grime, oil and wax that gives the
wood a dingy appearance. I would suggest using a good quality oil-based
furniture cleaner applied with a soft cloth as a starting point for
removing this grime. I have had good luck with a furniture cleaner from
Holloway House I found right at the grocery store. If you have
particularly tough-to remove grime, try a product called DeSolveIt
available at Lowes--again apply a little to a soft cloth.

Once you have used the furniture cleaner, a light coat of a liquid lemon
oil  applied with a soft cloth may be all that is needed.
If scratches are still visible, try a light coat of the old English 
furniture polish that has the brown dye in it. (Yup, the same product
your mother used is still readily available) It works quite well on a lot
of scratches in terms of hiding them

If you have larger nicks and scratches, I like to work those over with a
product from Minwax called Wood Sheen in one of the darker colors.
This comes in various colors though I tend to favor what they call
Colonial Walnut which seems to work well on most darker woods. I
think there is a mahogany color that might work well on cherry furniture
as well. This is a tung oil based colored gel-like product. Just put a little
on a soft cloth and rub it on the scratch or chip and the area around it.
Let it dry for an hour or so and buff out the area. If the chipped area is
not dark enough you can apply more coats, allowing 24 hours drying
time between each coat. This goes right over the old finish.It's possible
to refinish larger areas with this product too. 

For circles left by glasses, try rubbing out the area with a cloth that has
some silver polish on it--then polish with lemon oil. I've also had good
luck with the product they sell in the automotive parts places for
polishing alloy wheels. It's a very fine polishing compound. Some
people swear by toothpaste too. The Willett finish tends to spot and
dissolve with alcohol. These types of spots can often be buffed so that
they are less noticeable with any of these products, followed by a coat
of lemon oil. Professional furniture restorers sometimes use a few drops
of alcohol on a soft cloth and lots of rubbing to "melt" some of the
original finish into the damage spots, but this is not a technique for
amateur to attempt


None of these techniques remove any of the original finish. I would
consider refinishing only if an entire section was peeling or otherwise
in very bad condition, and even there I would think twice before
refinishing the entire piece.

Once the wood is free of grime, I wouldn't discourage anyone from
following the manufacturer's recommendation to apply a light coat of a
top quality paste wax, buffing out with a soft cloth.

And, don't worry if you can't get a completely like-new look. If that is
the look you wanted you probably should have purchased new furniture.
Part of the charm of owning older furniture is that the pieces have
picked up some nicks and scratches over the years--a finish that you
can't buy in new furniture. It's only when the condition of the finish
severely detracts from the beauty of the piece that this is any big deal.

 A Note from Bernard Z. Lee

Consider H. Willett Company and its kitchen cabinet operation in New Albany 
was bought by a Houston, Texas investor named Irvin D. Kaplan, in the early 1960s.  
It was his intention to continue the operation of both companies. 

However operating costs at the furniture company had gotten out 
of hand and the company was losing money.  
In an effort to cure the problem, negotiations 
were begun with the union seeking some concessions and cost reductions.  
Those efforts were getting no where and a decision was taken to liquidate.  
The plan included the termination of manufacturing by completing whatever was 
in process but starting no new product. 

That procedure took some weeks during which time the union continued negotiating, but it was too late.  
The plant and its operations had, for all practical effects, been shut down.  
Assuming a successful arrangement with the union could have been reached, 
the cost of restarting manufacture was prohibitive and the liquidation 
was completed.

This is of a cherry wood night table/end table. We have a pair, 
which I believe were some of the last items to come off the line. 
They are stenciled on the bottom:
                        WILLETT
                               34
                            55-92

when Kaplan bought the company.  He was a dear friend and gave me the desk.
