About[edit]
Carl Moyes was a truck driver hauling produce for C. R. England Trucking in the 1940s out of northern Utah.[3] In the late 1950s Betty and Carl Moyes started a small trucking company in Plain City, Utah, B & C Truck Leasing, and after their son, Jerry, graduated from Weber State University in 1966, they moved the small company to Phoenix, Arizona. Carl, and his two sons, Ronald and Jerry (vice-president), formed the company, as Common Market, in Arizona, that would become Swift.
Operations began in 1966 transporting imported steel from the ports of Los Angeles, California to Phoenix, Arizona, and then returning with cotton from Arizona to be delivered to Southern California.[4]
The name Swift Transportation was purchased from a descendant of the Swift Meat Packing family, when the Moyes family bought the trucking assets of Swift & Company. The three Moyes's and a fourth partner, Randy Knight, grew the business to $25 million in annual revenues by 1984. Jerry became president, chairman, and CEO that same year, and when Carl died in 1985, Jerry bought out his other two partners, his brother Ronald and Randy Knight. Ronald would continue to hold shares in Swift while Randy would become a co-founder in Knight Transportation.[5]
In April 1988 Swift purchased Greenville, South Carolina-based Cooper Motor Lines from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based ARA Services.[6]
By 1990, Swift Transportation had grown to a $125 million carrier with over 800 trucks.[4] The company did an initial public offering (IPO) in 1990 and became a publicly traded entity on the NASDAQ market system under the symbol SWFT.
In 1991, with money raised in the IPO, Swift bought Stephens City, Virginia-based Arthur H. Fulton Inc. for $9 million. Fulton was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the time.[7]
In a similar move, in 2001 Moyes purchased all of the properties, assets, and accounts of Dick Simon Trucking, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Those assets were rolled into Moyes' small Central Freight Lines out of Texas, and later spun off as the separate corporate entity Central Refrigerated Service, which remained wholly owned by Moyes until its subsequent sale to and merger with Swift. The sale was announced in summer 2013, and the merger completed and operating authority officially transferred to Swift On February 1, 2014. Moyes received $180 million in cash for the sale.
The company growth has continued since 1988 with the purchasing of (11) different motor carriers throughout the United States, including M.S. Carriers, of Memphis, Tennessee in 2000. The shareholders of M.S. Carriers obtained a 22% stake in the combined company.[8]
Moyes was about to retire, but was forced out as chief executive officer (CEO) at Swift in October 2005 after a United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into insider trading. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing he paid a $1.26 million settlement. The Moyes family still controlled about 39% of the issued public stock.[9][10]
In November 2006 Moyes offered to buy Swift for $29 a share. The offer was raised to $2.4 billion ($31.55 per share) for all outstanding shares not controlled by the family and assuming $332 million in outstanding debt, the transaction was closed on May 10, 2007.[11] To finance the acquisition, Moyes formed Saint Acquisition Corporation, and issued $2.1 billion of a senior secured credit facility and $835 million in second-lien senior secured notes.[9] The company's drivers and eighty-three percent of all outstanding shares (approximately half of those controlled by the family) supported the buyout.[10]
Swift’s terminal network grew to over forty full service facilities in both the continental United States and Mexico, but then closed a few after the 2008 financial recession. The total number of employees dropped from 21,900,[12] to approximately 17,700.[1] Swift owns 100% of Trans-Mex, a Nuevo Laredo, Mexico-based carrier. Swift offers border crossing services at all major Mexican border crossings. Swift maintains a presence in every Canadian Province.[4]
The company operated 16,200 units (12,300 tractors by company drivers and 3,900 owner-operator tractors), a fleet of 48,600 trailers, and 4,500 intermodal containers from 35 terminals in the United States and Mexico, generating just over $2.5 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.[1]
Swift Transportation went public once again on December 16, 2010, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[13] The company offered 73,300,000 shares at $11.00 per share, raising almost $766 million, with the proceeds being used for debt reduction. The offering represented 54.9% of the company, valuing the company at $1.86 billion. Due to the economic downturn, the IPO was below Moyes leveraged-buyout (LBO) price of $17.61. With the offering the name officially change from Swift Holdings Corp. to Swift Transportation Company.[1][14]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The company was founded by Jerry C. Moyes in 1966 and is headquartered in Phoenix, AZ.

Swift Transportation is a Phoenix, Arizona-based publicly held American truckload motor shipping carrier. With over 16,000 trucks, it is one of the largest common carriers in the United States. In 2017, Swift announced that it was merging with Knight Transportation, also of Phoenix, to be called Knight-Swift.[2]

About[edit]
Carl Moyes was a truck driver hauling produce for C. R. England Trucking in the 1940s out of northern Utah.[3] In the late 1950s Betty and Carl Moyes started a small trucking company in Plain City, Utah, B & C Truck Leasing, and after their son, Jerry, graduated from Weber State University in 1966, they moved the small company to Phoenix, Arizona. Carl, and his two sons, Ronald and Jerry (vice-president), formed the company, as Common Market, in Arizona, that would become Swift.
Operations began in 1966 transporting imported steel from the ports of Los Angeles, California to Phoenix, Arizona, and then returning with cotton from Arizona to be delivered to Southern California.[4]
The name Swift Transportation was purchased from a descendant of the Swift Meat Packing family, when the Moyes family bought the trucking assets of Swift & Company. The three Moyes's and a fourth partner, Randy Knight, grew the business to $25 million in annual revenues by 1984. Jerry became president, chairman, and CEO that same year, and when Carl died in 1985, Jerry bought out his other two partners, his brother Ronald and Randy Knight. Ronald would continue to hold shares in Swift while Randy would become a co-founder in Knight Transportation.[5]
In April 1988 Swift purchased Greenville, South Carolina-based Cooper Motor Lines from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based ARA Services.[6]
By 1990, Swift Transportation had grown to a $125 million carrier with over 800 trucks.[4] The company did an initial public offering (IPO) in 1990 and became a publicly traded entity on the NASDAQ market system under the symbol SWFT.
In 1991, with money raised in the IPO, Swift bought Stephens City, Virginia-based Arthur H. Fulton Inc. for $9 million. Fulton was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the time.[7]
In a similar move, in 2001 Moyes purchased all of the properties, assets, and accounts of Dick Simon Trucking, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Those assets were rolled into Moyes' small Central Freight Lines out of Texas, and later spun off as the separate corporate entity Central Refrigerated Service, which remained wholly owned by Moyes until its subsequent sale to and merger with Swift. The sale was announced in summer 2013, and the merger completed and operating authority officially transferred to Swift On February 1, 2014. Moyes received $180 million in cash for the sale.
The company growth has continued since 1988 with the purchasing of (11) different motor carriers throughout the United States, including M.S. Carriers, of Memphis, Tennessee in 2000. The shareholders of M.S. Carriers obtained a 22% stake in the combined company.[8]
Moyes was about to retire, but was forced out as chief executive officer (CEO) at Swift in October 2005 after a United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into insider trading. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing he paid a $1.26 million settlement. The Moyes family still controlled about 39% of the issued public stock.[9][10]
In November 2006 Moyes offered to buy Swift for $29 a share. The offer was raised to $2.4 billion ($31.55 per share) for all outstanding shares not controlled by the family and assuming $332 million in outstanding debt, the transaction was closed on May 10, 2007.[11] To finance the acquisition, Moyes formed Saint Acquisition Corporation, and issued $2.1 billion of a senior secured credit facility and $835 million in second-lien senior secured notes.[9] The company's drivers and eighty-three percent of all outstanding shares (approximately half of those controlled by the family) supported the buyout.[10]
Swift’s terminal network grew to over forty full service facilities in both the continental United States and Mexico, but then closed a few after the 2008 financial recession. The total number of employees dropped from 21,900,[12] to approximately 17,700.[1] Swift owns 100% of Trans-Mex, a Nuevo Laredo, Mexico-based carrier. Swift offers border crossing services at all major Mexican border crossings. Swift maintains a presence in every Canadian Province.[4]
The company operated 16,200 units (12,300 tractors by company drivers and 3,900 owner-operator tractors), a fleet of 48,600 trailers, and 4,500 intermodal containers from 35 terminals in the United States and Mexico, generating just over $2.5 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.[1]
Swift Transportation went public once again on December 16, 2010, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[13] The company offered 73,300,000 shares at $11.00 per share, raising almost $766 million, with the proceeds being used for debt reduction. The offering represented 54.9% of the company, valuing the company at $1.86 billion. Due to the economic downturn, the IPO was below Moyes leveraged-buyout (LBO) price of $17.61. With the offering the name officially change from Swift Holdings Corp. to Swift Transportation Company.[1][14]

Which type of driver are you?

Careers










"Above average pay for above average drivers."



"Swift is my family, I love my job, am treated well and do my best to treat others the same."





Home Time
As rewarding as life on the road may be, we understand the importance of home. At Swift, it is all about balancing the life equation. This means getting you home for your well deserved home time is a priority.


Equipment
We have intimate relationships with the industry’s top manufacturers. Swift uses late model Freightliner and Volvo tractors—92% of which are less than five years old.


Technology
Each Swift truck features Qualcomm on-board computers. They provide wireless communications that help improve driver and dispatcher productivity, reduce fuel consumption and improve customer service.

The terminal leadership treated me like a red headed stepchild because I was a driver before being placed in  the office in any capacity. The load planner on the weekend would do favors for certain drivers, but only after they either bought him food or coffee. I always felt like I had a bullseye on my back when walking in the door.

I did when I worked there. I did get along with my supervisor and benefits were good. Can be very exhausting and boring at times...especially when driving a lot but you get breaks. However, what I didn't like that sometimes they would give you short distance load which makes you little money. There were times when you have to wait for awhile or longer to get another load. Which can be frustrating because you only get paid when your truck is moving. Other than that, Swift is an okay company to work for.ProsBenefits, nice trucks, truck stops, bringing spouseConsless home timeWas this review helpful?Yes 1No Report Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureSafety AuditingSafety Auditor (Current Employee) –  Phoenix, AZ – July 21, 2017I enjoy working on the computer and I am good at detail work.

Good attitude towards drivers.Truck Driver Class A (Current Employee) –  Corrine, UT – July 21, 2017I was on the walmart account in Swift Transportation company. The office people were amazing. The driver managers were good to drivers. But the OTR experience for Swift was the worst experience I had. Driver manager for OTR never really help drivers and they always pass things on to other departments when you ask them for help. For example, when you ask your driver manager for help on the Bills of Lading. They alway say that i need to check with the customer if it was wrong. Then I would tell them I double check and they will put me on hold. Then another person from a different department would answer and they would do the same thing over again. I just hate the way Swift OTR office workers act. But in the dedicated Walmart account in Corrine, UT.
