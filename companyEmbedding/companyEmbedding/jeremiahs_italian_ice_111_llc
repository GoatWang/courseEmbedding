 Jeremiah's Italian IceAbout

AboutJeremiah's Italian Ice started as an idea in the mind of owner Jeremy Litwack, back when he was a high school student selling Italian Ice in front of the Philadelphia Mint.  Jeremy became determined to create a market for this cool, refreshing frozen treat outside of the Northeast, starting with Central Florida, where the product was relatively unknown at the time.  

The Jeremiah’s menu offers over 40 varieties of Italian Ice that span the taste spectrum, from exquisite to exciting. These flavors include traditional lemon, tangy green apple, strawberry lemon, mango, black and red raspberry, chocolate, banana, Cookies n' Cream, Pina Colada, P-Nutty, Scoop Froggy Frog (a mint chocolate chip flavor), and many more.  The ‘Gelati’ is a favorite among Jeremiah's Italian Ice’s customers. It is a delightful layering of any Italian Ice flavor with rich and creamy vanilla, chocolate, or twist soft serve ice cream.

Over the years, the Jeremiah’s brand has continued to expand in the Central Florida area, boasting eight popular locations with an incredibly passionate fan base. Additionally, a highly anticipated franchising program is currently in the works. This fun and exciting brand is growing rapidly, always sticking to its founding principle – ‘Live Live To The Coolest’.Share This PageWebsiteFollow on TwitterFollow on FacebookCategory(s):Italian Icefrozen dessertsice creamorlandofloridaGelatisSoft ServeCentral Florida
