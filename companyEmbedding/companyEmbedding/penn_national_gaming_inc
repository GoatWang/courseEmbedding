Procurement Policies

A solid financial standing 
A proven track record 
References 
Competitive with quality & pricing 
Timely price quotes 
Consistent on-time deliveries 



Our company purchasing policies as they relate to suppliers are as follows:
Ethics Hotline
Penn National Gaming, Inc. is committed to conducting its business at all times in a legal and ethical manner and in compliance with our Code of Conduct.
If you, as a Vendor, have a concern regarding unethical or unlawful activity, please report your concern anonymously to the Ethics Hotline by clicking here or calling 877-864-9164. We strongly encourage our employees and business partners to adhere to our Code of Ethics and Vendor Procurement Policies. 
The Ethics Hotline is a confidential tool that allows you to report violations and/or misconduct, including:

Financial Fraud
Accounting Matters
Discrimination
Harassment
Solicitation of Gifts, Favors and Entertainment
Confidential Information
Conflicts of Interest

The Ethics Hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is designed to protect your confidentiality. Penn National Gaming, Inc. prohibits retaliation and encourages an “open door” culture.
Interaction with suppliers
A key component of the purchasing process is the interaction with suppliers. Penn National Gaming Inc.'s success in these interactions has been built on our ability to maintain the highest level of integrity in the purchasing process. Determining the appropriate level of supplier interaction and limiting contact to those specific circumstances establishes and maintains the integrity of the process.
Prior to issuing a Purchase Order, the Company requires the supplier to complete and submit on line a Supplier Profile application. In addition to the Supplier Profile application and depending on the type of business, certain other information may be required as a result of state laws or regulations. 
Once suppliers have been established in the system, interaction will be necessary to understand their product lines and services, solicit bids, verify product availability and pricing, award bids, discuss delivery discrepancies, coordinate samples, place orders and secure cost quotes. There may also be an occasional need to discuss concerns with products, services or performance.
Delivery Policies
At all properties, supplier deliveries must be made to the receiving dock except where specific provisions have been made to deliver products directly to the user or where other provisions which would apply to controlled shipments. Suppliers are not permitted to deliver items directly to the ordering department or to Purchasing unless specifically authorized. Suppliers or their representatives are not permitted to place items directly into the storeroom or warehouse, except for those suppliers that manage the par stock level for the Property such as those that provide bread and dairy products. These suppliers will be accompanied by a Receiving department employee or escort. Only in emergencies will the Property receive products from suppliers after Receiving's normal work hours. Delivery of products after Receiving hours should not be permitted to occur on a regular basis.
Maintaining a proper working relationship with suppliers requires positive steps on the part of the Property managers, Purchasing Departments, Corporate Purchasing, Receiving and Accounts Payable.
Procurement Goals
In addition to licensing requirements, in some locations the Company has committed to certain procurement goals for purchasing from certified minority and/or female owned firms, and from local or in-state firms. In some, but not all of these locations, there are specific certification requirements relative to these firms and how they are calculated toward meeting these goals. The certification requirements may vary by location within the same state. This is true whether these commitments were made to the state or local governments where the property is located. Corporate Purchasing will facilitate training so that the purchasing staff is familiar with these requirements and ensure that best efforts are made to comply with specific commitments.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Pearson Staff Writer |
July 19, 2017 |











Shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NasdaqGS:PENN) currenty have a 10 year dividend growth rate of -99.90%. This number is calculated using the geometric average which provides the typical value of dividend growth over the specified period using the product of their values. The geometric average is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers.
 Solid dividend growth may be one sign of a healthy stock. Investors may be watching different time periods to assess dividend growth rates. The stock currently has an 8 year dividend growth rate of -99.90%, a 5 year of -99.90%, and a 3 year of 0.00%.
FCFFree Cash Flow or FCF, may be used to gauge the true profitability of a company. FCF measures the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, and it may be a useful indicator for assessing financial performance. Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NasdaqGS:PENN)’s FCF growth is presently at 3.682586. This is calculated by subtracting FCF from the previous year from FCF this year, divided by FCF from last year. The company has an FCF score of 3.122948. The FCF score is an indicator that is derived by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. In general, a higher FCF score value would signal high free cash flow growth. 
The current FCF quality score is 1.937203. The free quality score assists with estimating free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this number, a lower ratio is typically preferred. Looking a bit further, the company has an FCF yield of 0.044949, and a 5-year average FCF yield of 0.023344. The first is simply FCF divided by enterprise value, and the second is the five year average FCF divided by the current enterprise value.

At the time of writing, the SMA 50/200 Cross value is 1.28883. If the value is greater than one, the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average, which may signal positive stock price momentum. A value less than one would indicate that the 50 day moving average is below the 200 day, which may indicate negative share price momentum.
RangeInvestors often keep track of key stock price levels when doing equity research. Two standard levels are the 52-week high and 52-week low. Shares tend to come under increased scrutiny when approaching either of the two marks. After a recent check, the current stock price divided by the 52-week high for shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NasdaqGS:PENN), gives us a value of 0.942.

History[edit]
The company traces its roots to Penn National Race Course, which opened in 1972 in the Harrisburg suburb of Grantville, Pennsylvania.[2]
The company was incorporated as PNRC Corp. in 1982, and changed its name to Penn National Gaming, Inc. in 1994.
In 2003, Penn National bought Hollywood Casino Corp. for $328 million plus $360 million in assumed debt, gaining casinos in Aurora, Illinois; Tunica, Mississippi; and Shreveport, Louisiana.[3]
In 2005, Penn National acquired Argosy Gaming Company for $2.2 billion making it at the time the third largest publicly held gaming company in the country[4] (behind MGM Mirage and Harrah's Entertainment).
In November 2006 Penn National Gaming failed in an attempt to acquire Harrah's Entertainment.[5] The deal to purchase Harrah's fell through, and Harrah's was eventually taken over by two private equity firms.
In 2007 it acquired the Zia Park racino in Hobbs, New Mexico for $200 million.
An attempt in 2007 to take company private with a $6.1 billion buyout fell through with prospective buyers, New York-based Fortress Investment Group and Centerbridge Partners.[6]
In November 2012, Penn National announced a plan to spin off 17 of its 29 properties in a new real estate investment trust (REIT), in an effort to reduce taxes and cost of capital, and overcome license ownership restrictions. The REIT would also pursue sale-and-leaseback transactions with other casino operators.[7][8] The spin-off was completed on November 1, 2013, creating Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.[9]
In February 2013, Penn National agreed to sell the Bullwhackers Casino in Black Hawk to an investor group led by casino developer John Zimpel.[10]
In April 2015, the company agreed to purchase the Tropicana Las Vegas for $360 million.[11]
In August 2016, the company agreed to purchase Rocket Games for $60 million.[12]
In May 2017, Penn National acquired the operating assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $44 million, and leased the two casinos from GLPI, which had simultaneously purchased their real estate assets.[13][14]

History[edit]
The company traces its roots to Penn National Race Course, which opened in 1972 in the Harrisburg suburb of Grantville, Pennsylvania.[2]
The company was incorporated as PNRC Corp. in 1982, and changed its name to Penn National Gaming, Inc. in 1994.
In 2003, Penn National bought Hollywood Casino Corp. for $328 million plus $360 million in assumed debt, gaining casinos in Aurora, Illinois; Tunica, Mississippi; and Shreveport, Louisiana.[3]
In 2005, Penn National acquired Argosy Gaming Company for $2.2 billion making it at the time the third largest publicly held gaming company in the country[4] (behind MGM Mirage and Harrah's Entertainment).
In November 2006 Penn National Gaming failed in an attempt to acquire Harrah's Entertainment.[5] The deal to purchase Harrah's fell through, and Harrah's was eventually taken over by two private equity firms.
In 2007 it acquired the Zia Park racino in Hobbs, New Mexico for $200 million.
An attempt in 2007 to take company private with a $6.1 billion buyout fell through with prospective buyers, New York-based Fortress Investment Group and Centerbridge Partners.[6]
In November 2012, Penn National announced a plan to spin off 17 of its 29 properties in a new real estate investment trust (REIT), in an effort to reduce taxes and cost of capital, and overcome license ownership restrictions. The REIT would also pursue sale-and-leaseback transactions with other casino operators.[7][8] The spin-off was completed on November 1, 2013, creating Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.[9]
In February 2013, Penn National agreed to sell the Bullwhackers Casino in Black Hawk to an investor group led by casino developer John Zimpel.[10]
In April 2015, the company agreed to purchase the Tropicana Las Vegas for $360 million.[11]
In August 2016, the company agreed to purchase Rocket Games for $60 million.[12]
In May 2017, Penn National acquired the operating assets of Bally's Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica for a total of $44 million, and leased the two casinos from GLPI, which had simultaneously purchased their real estate assets.[13][14]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
