(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the other unaudited financial data included in this Annual Report. We further invite you to visit our website, www.rreefpropertytrust.com, where we routinely post additional information about our company, such as, without limitation, our daily net asset value, or NAV, per share, press releases and information about upcoming investor conference calls.

The Company's NAV per share is published daily via NASDAQ's Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbols ZRPTAX, ZRPTIX and ZRPTTX for its Class A shares, Class I shares and Class T shares, respectively. Overview We are a Maryland corporation formed on February 7, 2012, to invest in a diversified portfolio of high quality, income-producing commercial real estate properties and other real estate-related assets. We are an externally advised, perpetual-life corporation that qualified as a REIT for the calendar year ended December 31, 2013 for federal income tax purposes. We hold our properties, real estate-related assets and other investments through RREEF Property Operating Partnership, LP, or our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We invest primarily in the office, industrial, retail and multifamily sectors of the commercial real estate industry in the United States. We may also invest in real estate-related assets, which include common and preferred stock of publicly traded REITs and other real estate companies, which we refer to as "real estate equity securities," and debt investments backed by real estate, which we refer to as "real estate loans."  Our board of directors will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, our board has delegated to our advisor authority to manage our day-to-day business in accordance with our investment objectives, strategy, guidelines, policies and limitations.  On May 30, 2013, upon receipt of a purchase order from our sponsor for $10,000,000 of Class I shares of our common stock and the release to us of funds in the escrow account, we commenced operations. Prior to May 30, 2013, we had neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues. Our entire activity from our inception date through May 30, 2013 was to prepare for and implement our public offering of our common stock.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we accomplished the following:   Acquired one medical office property outside of Boston, Massachusetts, for $34,000,000, increasing both our geographic and property type diversification;   Expanded our Wells Fargo line of credit to a maximum capacity of $100,000,000;   Maintained 100% occupancy in the real estate portfolio;   Secured two fully non-recourse, fixed-rate loans totaling $27.5 million on two separate properties;   Successfully launched our follow-on public offering; and   Raised approximately $27.6 million of new capital from investors.  Further detail on these activities is provided below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.  Portfolio Information  Real Estate Portfolio  Table of Contents  this acquisition with existing capital and $17,600,000 from our line of credit. Of the $17,600,000 borrowed, $8,760,000 was from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while $8,840,000 was allocated to Commerce Corner. Commerce Corner is a 259,910 square-foot industrial building located on a 14.4 acre site at 1109 Commerce Boulevard, plus an additional adjacent 9.7 acre parcel of land which is partially utilized by one of the tenants for additional trailer parking. Situated one mile from Exit 10 of Interstate 295 and in close proximity to Interstate 95 and the New Jersey Turnpike, the northeast distribution corridor's primary north/south highways, Commerce Corner is strategically positioned at the front of the 3.1 million square foot LogistiCenter at Logan industrial park.  On October 2, 2014, we acquired a fee simple interest in a retail building located in Chula Vista, California ("Terra Nova Plaza") for a purchase price of $21,850,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded this acquisition with existing capital and by borrowing $19,100,000 from our line of credit. Of the $19,100,000 borrowed, $7,100,000 was from existing borrowing capacity secured by previously acquired properties, while $12,000,000 was specific to Terra Nova Plaza. Terra Nova Plaza is a 96,114 square-foot, one-story retail building constructed in 1986 and located on an 8.34 acre site in Chula Vista, California. Chula Vista is situated 7.5 miles from downtown San Diego and 11 miles from the San Diego International Airport. Terra Nova Plaza is at the intersection of Interstate 805 and H Street, providing access, visibility and drive-by traffic on H Street.  2015 Acquisitions  On September 30, 2015, we acquired a fee simple interest in a student housing building located in Athens, Georgia ("The Flats at Carrs Hill") for a purchase price of $27,000,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded this acquisition by borrowing $27,000,000 from our line of credit. Of the $27,000,000 borrowed, $13,570,962 was from existing borrowing capacity secured by previously acquired properties, while $13,429,038 was specific to The Flats at Carrs Hill. The Flats at Carrs Hill is a 135,864 square-foot five-story student housing building with 138 units and 316 beds on a 14.3 acre site located at 592 Oconee Street in Athens, Georgia, just one quarter of a mile east of the University of Georgia ("UGA") campus and within walking distance from coffee shops, bookstores, restaurants and bars. Among other amenities, The Flats at Carrs Hill features a full-size indoor basketball court, multiple lounges, a 24-hour fitness center and a pool. Additionally, UGA recently approved an expansion of the North Oconee River Greenway trail, a 3.65 mile walking and biking path, which will provide the student residents direct pedestrian access to additional parts of campus.  On December 21, 2015, we acquired a fee simple interest in an office building located in Sterling, Virginia ("Loudoun Gateway") for a purchase price of $21,950,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with existing capital and by borrowing $20,000,000 from our line of credit. Of the $20,000,000 borrowed, approximately $8,000,000 was from existing borrowing capacity secured by previously acquired properties, while approximately $12,000,000 was specific to Loudoun Gateway.

The greater Washington, DC metropolitan area can be accessed via four routes: Route 28, the Dulles Toll Road, Route 50, and Route 7. Dining, entertainment and shopping facilities in Dulles Town Center, Dulles Town Crossing, Dulles 28 Centre, and Reston Town Center are all within short driving distances of Loudoun Gateway.  2016 Acquisition  On September 27, 2016, we acquired a fee simple interest in a medical office building located in Dedham, Massachusetts ("Allied Drive") for a purchase price of $34,000,000, exclusive of closing costs. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and a $32,400,000 borrowing from our Wells Fargo line of credit. Of the $32,400,000 borrowed, approximately $13,100,000 is from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while approximately  Table of Contents  $19,300,000 is allocated to Allied Drive.

Allied Drive is also accessible via the commuter rail MBTA stop, which services Boston in less than 10 minutes. Legacy Place, University Station, Dedham Mall and Hilton Boston - Dedham are within short driving distances of Allied Drive, offering tenants a multitude of dining, entertainment and lodging options. Newly constructed in 2013, Allied Drive was built with a full spectrum of orthopedic-related services, featuring eight state-of-the-art operating rooms, a hospital-quality post-anesthesia care unit, diagnostic imaging and ancillary service space and Class A medical office suites.  As of December 31, 2016, our weighted average remaining lease term was 7.1 years.

Real Estate Equity Securities Portfolio  As of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio consisted of publicly traded common stock of 40 REITs with a value of $8,609,212. We believe that investing a portion of our proceeds from our offering into a diversified portfolio of common and preferred shares of REITs and other real estate operating companies will provide our overall portfolio flexibility with near-term liquidity as well as potentially enhance our NAV over a longer period. The real estate equity securities portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated to determine whether the marketable securities held at any time continue to serve their original intended purposes.  The following chart summarizes our marketable securities by property type as of December 31, 2016:  Table of Contents  [[Image Removed: rpt-2014q3_chartx40366a03a04.jpg]] As of December 31, 2016, our top ten holdings in our real estate equity securities portfolio were as follows:   Security Percent of Securities Portfolio Simon Property Group, Inc. 8.8 % Prologis, Inc. 6.7 Public Storage 5.7 Welltower, Inc. 5.6 Vornado Realty Trust 5.0 Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 3.9 General Growth Properties, Inc. 3.6 Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. 3.1 Essex Property Trust, Inc. 3.1 AvalonBay Communities, Inc. 3.0 Total 48.5 %  Market Outlook  Commercial real estate had a strong year during 2016. For the most part, demand continued to outstrip supply, pushing vacancy rates lower and rents higher. Commercial real estate prices generally ended the year above where they started, delivering total returns to core real estate in line with the historical average for commercial real estate. In more subtle ways, however, we believe the landscape began to shift. While fundamentals were strong, financial-market volatility curbed the decline of capitalization rates that had powered capital gains since 2010. Total annual returns on an unleveraged basis slipped into the single digits for the first time since the recent financial crisis.  We believe that commercial real estate will deliver a similar return profile over the next five years. Given that supply is generally moderate and shows tentative signs of peaking, we believe that real estate is positioned to generate healthy net operating income growth. At the same time, rising interest rates and temperate capital flows directly into commercial real estate are expected to put modest upward pressure on capitalization rates, slowing the pace of appreciation. We expect  Table of Contents  total annual unleveraged returns on commercial real estate will be primarily income driven, averaging 5%-6% annually through 2021 (6%-7% over the next two years).  While a more normalized return profile may be disappointing to some investors, in our view it represents a soft landing that should be welcomed. We believe the U.S. economy does not suffer from overt excesses, such as inflation or asset bubbles, that have precipitated past recessions. We believe supply is generally under control, real estate is not over-leveraged and valuations are not stretched on a relative basis. In this context, a moderation of returns should help extend the duration of the cycle, or in a worst case scenario, cushion the severity of any downturn, which we continue to believe is several years off.  Results of Operations  We commenced operations on May 30, 2013 upon receipt of $10,000,000 in proceeds from our sponsor in our initial public offering. On May 31, 2013, we acquired our first property and made our initial investments in marketable securities. Since then and through December 31, 2016, we acquired seven additional properties and significantly increased our outstanding debt balance as described above under "Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio." In addition, we expect to continue to raise additional capital, increase our borrowings and make future acquisitions, which we believe will have a significant impact on our future results of operations.  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015  Revenues  Our rental income increased to $15,102,464 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $8,050,514 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our tenant reimbursement income increased to $1,514,772 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1,066,073 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income increased from 2015 due to the property acquisitions occurring during 2015 and 2016 as described above under "Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio." Also included in our 2016 rental and tenant reimbursement income is approximately $1,499,234 related to the fully amortized below market lease liability at Terra Nova Plaza for The Sports Authority, Inc. In connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of The Sports Authority, Inc., on June 29, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. won the right at auction to assume and/or negotiate a new lease for the space at Terra Nova Plaza occupied by The Sports Authority, Inc. In September 2016, we executed a 10-year lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., which was subsequently approved by the bankruptcy court on September 26, 2016 at which time Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. became the tenant, effectively terminating the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. At such time, all remaining lease intangibles related to The Sports Authority, Inc. were fully amortized through the lease termination date.  Straight line revenues increased to $836,108 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $431,065 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in straight line revenues for 2016 over 2015 was due to our additional property acquisitions. Typically, our leases have contractual base rent increases, which cause corresponding decreases in the straight line rent adjustments once effective. In addition, we recognized approximately $264,000 of straight line revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., a result of the lease beginning in September 2016 but cash base rent not commencing until March 1, 2017.  Heritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza represent our same-store real estate investments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, being the properties owned for the entirety of both periods. For those properties, property income was up $1,622,000 in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to $1,499,234 from the full amortization of the below market lease liability related to the termination of the lease with The Sports Authority, Inc. as described above. Base rental income had a minimal change over the prior period as contractual base rent increases at the properties were offset by three months of free rent at Terra Nova Plaza related to the lease with Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. Straight line revenue increased by approximately $125,000, primarily a result of the $264,000 recognized from the Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. lease offsetting decreases from the other properties. In addition, the 2016 period saw increased tenant reimbursements of approximately $57,000 primarily related similar increases in recoverable operating expenses.  Our investment income on marketable securities increased to $484,912 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $284,627 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in investment income was due to certain securities providing greater distributions in 2016 as a result of asset sales. Such greater distributions may not continue in future periods. The portfolio is regularly adjusted by increasing and decreasing specific holdings primarily based upon  Table of Contents  changes in sector allocations and to a lesser degree based upon performance of specific securities. Proceeds from sale of securities are primarily reinvested in the common stock of other publicly traded REITs, thereby keeping a base of investments that generate dividend income. As of December 31, 2016, our real estate equity securities portfolio had a total investment cost of $8,103,761. All of our investment income on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was comprised of dividend income from these investments.  Expenses  Our total expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $19,214,799 and $10,310,944, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $2,091,416 and $2,012,137, respectively. Our general and administrative expenses include a variety of corporate expenses, the largest of which were audit fees, legal fees, professional fees, directors and officers insurance and independent director compensation. The amount for the 2016 period is higher than 2015 primarily due to higher audit fees and other professional fees related to tax and compliance.  Property operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $5,158,942 and $2,118,849, respectively. The increase in property operating expenses from 2015 to 2016 is primarily due to the 2015 property acquisitions occurring late in the year as described above under "Portfolio Information-Real Estate Portfolio." In addition, we recognized approximately $545,000 of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the bankruptcy filing of The Sports Authority, Inc. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation was $3,826,198 and $2,233,667, respectively and amortization was $6,803,850 and $2,735,138, respectively. Depreciation and amortization also increased in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period as a result of the additional acquisitions. Furthermore, the 2016 period includes $1,898,000 in amortization expense due to the full amortization of the acquired intangible lease assets related to The Sports Authority, Inc. lease.  On a same-store basis (for Heritage Parkway, Wallingford Plaza, Commerce Corner, Anaheim Hills Office Plaza and Terra Nova Plaza), property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $628,000 compared to the same period of 2015 primarily due to $545,000 of bad debt expense and, to a lesser degree, legal costs, at Terra Nova Plaza related to the bankruptcy of The Sports Authority, Inc. In addition, we recognized increased real estate taxes of approximately $40,000, primarily related to Commerce Corner. On a same-store basis, amortization increased approximately $1,854,000, primarily due to the additional amortization related to The Sports Authority Inc. lease as noted above, however, depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015.  The fixed component of the advisory fee is equal to 1% per annum of the NAV for each share class and is calculated and accrued daily and reflected in our NAV per share. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fixed component of the advisory fee was $900,726 and $607,614, respectively. The fixed component of the advisory fee was not earned by our advisor until our combined NAV for all share classes reached $50,000,000, which occurred on January 22, 2015. The increase in the fixed component of the advisory fee is due to the additional capital raised during 2016 as well as an increase to our NAV resulting from appreciation of our real estate investments.  Acquisition related expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $158,762 and $603,539, respectively. The 2016 amount related to our acquisition of Allied Drive and the 2015 amount related primarily to our acquisitions of The Flats at Carrs Hill and Loudoun Gateway. Acquisition related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 also included costs related to pursuit of acquisitions that we ultimately decided not to complete.  Table of Contents  We expect our acquisition related expenses, depreciation, amortization and property operating expenses to increase in future periods because we anticipate acquiring additional properties in the future.  Interest Expense  For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $2,427,110 compared to $1,330,601 for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a greater weighted average outstanding aggregate loan balance due to additional borrowings on our line of credit related to acquisitions which occurred in the second half of 2015 and late 2016. The weighted average outstanding balance on our line of credit was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in our weighted average balance on our line of credit was attributable to our ownership of a greater number of properties during 2016 as compared to 2015. Additionally contributing to the increased interest expense in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period is the long term property specific loans that were originated in 2016. On March 1, 2016, we originated a $14,500,000 loan for The . . .  Mar 16, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
