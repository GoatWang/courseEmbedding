MONTREAL, June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Addenda Capital Inc. and SEI Trust Company today announced a partnership to launch a collective investment trust (CIT) fund in the United States. The Montréal-based, SEC-registered investment management firm with more than USD$20 billion in assets under management will act as an advisor for the CIT. 








The fund was created by the SEI Trust Company, a subsidiary of SEI, a leading supplier of customized operating infrastructure and services to investment organizations worldwide. Addenda Capital chose to work with SEI in order to cater to investors of all sizes. 
Addenda Capital is a strong proponent of sustainable investment. In addition to promoting sustainable financial markets, the Company performs deep fundamental research which integrates ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors into its investment processes in an effort to deliver consistently superior long-term returns while maintaining a low turnover. 
"Building on our success in Canada, we want to intensify our business development activities in the United States," said Roger Beauchemin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addenda Capital. "Our International Equity strategy has performed well above industry average and we are confident that we can deliver superior results to investors thanks to our 20+ years of experience, our innovative approach and the CIT's low-cost structure. We now have dedicated resources to build relationships with institutional investors and consultants across the U.S."
CITs: Flexible, Efficient and Effectively-Priced 
CITs, also known as collective investment funds (CIFs), are pooled funds operated by a bank or trust company. They are available to qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and other retirement and employee retirement benefit plans. Economies of scale allow for generally lower marketing, overhead and no Board of Directors or SEC filing expenses. Thus, investors benefit from enhanced profits. Unlike mutual funds, collective trusts are regulated by either the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state banking authority or agency.
A pioneer in the CIT arena, the SEI Trust Company has successfully partnered with CIT advisors for more than 25 years. It currently provides services to more than 170 CITs representing $45 billion in assets under management, making it one of the leading providers of CITs. "Addenda Capital's expertise with its International Equity Strategy coupled with SEI's scalable, flexible infrastructure is an appealing combination for investors and consultants," said John Alshefski, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of SEI's Investment Manager Services division.  
About Addenda Capital
Addenda Capital is a solution-driven privately-owned investment management firm with more than USD$20 billion in assets under management. The Firm offers a broad range of strategies that can be customized to meet the evolving needs of its clients, which include institutional clients such as pension funds, corporations, insurance companies and not-for-profit organizations, as well as high net worth clients. Addenda Capital aims to add value through deep fundamental research, active management, innovation, discipline and integrity. It prides itself on exceptional client relationships built on open and transparent communications. Its approach to sustainable investment focuses on integrating environmental, social and governance issues into all of its investment processes to deliver higher-quality portfolios. 
Headquartered in Montréal (Québec), Canada, Addenda Capital has offices in Toronto, Guelph and Regina. It is co-owned by Co-operators Financial Services, a subsidiary of Canadian insurance co-operative The Co-operators Group Limited, by labour-sponsored firm Fonds de Solidarité FTQ, and by Management Shareholders. Addenda Capital is a Sustaining Member of the Responsible Investment Association (RIA), an Investor Member of the Green Bond Principles, and a signatory of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and of the Montréal Carbon Pledge. Thanks to exceptional employee engagement, Addenda Capital was awarded Aon Hewitt's highest recognition in its 2017 Canadian Small and Medium Enterprise ranking as a Platinum-level Employer of Choice.

The Co-operators and Addenda Capital Inc. Announce Agreement - Feb 25, 2008





























News Releases



The Co-operators and Addenda Capital Inc. Announce Agreement
Feb 25, 20087:00am




    GUELPH, ON and MONTREAL, Feb. 25 /CNW/ - The Co-operators Group Ltd.
("The Co-operators") and Montreal-based institutional investment management
firm Addenda Capital Inc. ("Addenda") (TSX: ADV) today announced that they
have entered into an agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Addenda will
amalgamate with a subsidiary of The Co-operators ("Newco") and the
shareholders of Addenda will receive upon completion of the amalgamation
$26.50 in cash for each Addenda share, representing a premium of 23.8% to the
closing price of $21.40 for Addenda common shares on Friday February 22, 2008
and a premium of 25.7% to the 20-day volume weighted average price of $21.09
for Addenda common shares. The transaction, which values Addenda's equity at
approximately $306.5 million, will be implemented by way of a statutory
amalgamation under the Companies Act (Quebec) and is subject to customary
conditions precedent including approval of the amalgamation by shareholders of
Addenda and obtaining any required regulatory approvals.
    Certain senior management shareholders of Addenda (the "Senior Management
Shareholders") will exchange, immediately prior to the amalgamation, in the
aggregate approximately 50% of their common shares of Addenda for shares of
Newco. Solidarity Fund QFL ("the Fund"), a current shareholder of Addenda,
will exchange, immediately prior to the Amalgamation, 100% of its common
shares of Addenda for shares of Newco and will subscribe to additional common
shares of Newco. Certain other employees of Addenda ("the Employee
Shareholders") will be offered an opportunity to exchange, immediately prior
to amalgamation, part of their common shares of Addenda for shares of Newco.
    The Senior Management Shareholders and the Fund, representing
approximately 25% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Addenda, have
each entered into a voting support agreement pursuant to which they have
agreed, subject to certain conditions, to vote their common shares in favour
of the amalgamation.
    The proposed amalgamation has been approved unanimously by the Board of
Directors of Addenda (with interested directors abstaining) following the
report and favourable, unanimous recommendation of a Transaction Committee
comprised of three independent directors, namely Marie Giguère (Chair),
Richard Drouin and Pierre Martin. In doing so, the Addenda Board determined
that the amalgamation is fair to the Addenda shareholders other than the
Senior Management Shareholders, the Employee Shareholders who will acquire
shares of Newco and the Fund (the "Public Shareholders") and in the best
interests of Addenda and authorized the submission of the amalgamation to
shareholders of Addenda for their approval at a special meeting of
shareholders. The Board of Addenda also has determined unanimously (with
interested directors abstaining) to recommend to the Public Shareholders that
they vote in favour of the amalgamation.
    The Transaction Committee received an opinion from its financial advisor,
CIBC World Markets Inc. that the consideration to be received under the
transaction is fair from a financial point of view to the Public Shareholders.
In addition, the Transaction Committee received a report on the value of the
Addenda shares from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.acting as independent valuator.
Copies of the fairness opinion and the formal valuation report, factors
considered by the Transaction Committee and the Board and other relevant
background information will be included in the management information circular
that will be sent to Addenda shareholders in connection with the special
meeting to consider the amalgamation.
    Addenda has agreed not to solicit competing acquisition proposals for
Addenda but has retained the ability to consider a competing acquisition
proposal not solicited by it which the Addenda Board believes may lead to a
superior proposal and to terminate the agreement in the event of a superior
proposal, subject to The Co-operators right to match and payment of a break-up
fee of $8.0 million. The agreement also allows Addenda to continue to declare
and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders in the ordinary course of
business.
    A meeting of shareholders to consider the amalgamation is anticipated to
take place in April. To be implemented, the amalgamation will require approval
by two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of common shares. The amalgamation
will also require approval by a simple majority of the votes cast by Public
Shareholders.
    Soon after the completion of the amalgamation, the business of Co-
operators Investment Counselling Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Co-
operators, will be combined with that of Addenda.
    With assets under management of approximately $29 billion, Addenda is a
leader in the institutional fixed income market. Based in Guelph, Ontario, The
Co-operators is the leading Canadian-owned multi-product insurance company.
The new entity, which will operate under the Addenda brand, will have offices
in Montreal, Toronto, Guelph and Regina, will manage approximately $40 billion
in assets and have significant potential for future growth.
    The combined entity will be known as Addenda Capital Inc. Addenda will be
headed by Michael White who will become President and CEO. Most of Addenda's
management will continue to serve in their current capacity within the new
entity. Myriam Larcher will remain Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial
Officer while Yvan Fontaine will act as Senior Vice President and Co-Chief
Investment Officer. Benoît Durocher will become Executive Vice President,
Client Service and Marketing. Joe DiMassimo, Senior Vice President Sales and
Service will continue to work out of Addenda's current Toronto office. The
senior management team has agreed to invest in the new entity given the strong
similarities between the respective corporate cultures of Addenda and The Co-
operators. Jim MacDonald, currently Chief Investment Officer of Co-operators
Investment Counselling, will become Senior Vice president and Co-Chief
Investment Officer of the new company.
    "This transaction creates a national investment manager of significant
scale and offers existing clients of Addenda and Co-operators Investment
Counselling Limited excellent choice in diversification of asset classes,
management styles and capabilities," commented Kathy Bardswick, president and
CEO of The Co-operators. "The two companies complement each other well, and
this acquisition supports The Co-operators strategic goal of significantly
growing our presence in Quebec."
    "We are very excited about this transaction which will allow Addenda to
team up with an insurance industry leader and its investment management
subsidiary. This combination will further enhance Addenda's ability to meet
our clients' needs in terms of specialty products such as liability driven
investing" said Carmand Normand, Executive Chairman of the Board of Addenda.
    "For its part, the Solidarity Fund QFL, is pleased to align itself with a
major strategic partner such as The Co-operators, whose values and vision are
perfectly attuned to its own. By increasing its assets under management and
having access to an already well established network, Addenda Capital will be
able to spur its growth across Canada. We are all the more pleased to see the
new entity will be headquartered in Montreal, raising further the city's
profile as a major player in the asset management industry," said Gaeten
Morin, Executive Vice President, Investments, at the Solidarity Fund QFL.
    Scotia Capital Inc. is acting as financial advisor and Borden Ladner
Gervais LLP is acting as legal counsel to The Co-operators. Pricewaterhouse
Coopers LLP acted as independent valuator and CIBC World Markets Inc. is
acting as financial advisor to Addenda and the Transaction Committee. Fasken
Martineau DuMoulin LLP is acting as legal counsel to the Transaction Committee
of Addenda and McCarthy Tetrault LLP is acting as legal counsel to the Senior
Management Shareholders. The Fund is supported by its in-house legal and
acquisition teams.
    Subject to receiving the required Addenda shareholder and regulatory
approvals and the satisfaction of the other customary conditions, it is
anticipated that this transaction would close in approximately two to three
months.

    Profile:

    Based in Guelph, Ontario, The Co-operators is a group of Canadian

On April 22, 2008, The Co-operators Group Ltd. ("The Co-operators") and Montreal-based institutional investment management firm Addenda Capital Inc. ("Addenda") completed the amalgamation of Addenda with 9192-8192 Québec Inc. ("Newco"), a subsidiary of The Co-operators.
In connection with the amalgamation, all shareholders (other than Newco) have received $26.50 in cash for each share of Addenda held immediately prior to the amalgamation. The transaction valued Addenda's equity at approximately $306.5 million.
Certain senior management shareholders of Addenda have exchanged, immediately prior to the amalgamation, in the aggregate approximately 50% of their common shares of Addenda for shares of Newco. Solidarity Fund QFL has exchanged, immediately prior to the amalgamation, 100% of its common shares of Addenda for shares of Newco and has subscribed to additional common shares of Newco. Certain employees of Addenda have also exchanged, immediately prior to the amalgamation, part of their common shares of Addenda for shares of Newco.
Based in Guelph, Ontario, The Co-operators is a group of Canadian companies offering home, auto, life, group, travel, commercial and farm insurance, as well as investment products. The Co operators Group Limited is a 100% Canadian-owned co-operative with assets of more than $7 billion. Owned by a group of Canadian co-operatives, credit unions and like-minded organizations, The Co-operators is well known for its community involvement and is listed among the 50 Best Employers in Canada. 
Addenda is an investment management firm specializing in the active management of fixed-income portfolios, primarily for institutional clients. As at December 31, 2007, Addenda had assets under management of approximately $29.3 billion.
The Transaction Committee of Addenda was advised by Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP with a team comprised of Robert Paré, Gilles Leclerc, Jean Michel Lapierre and Rebecca McLeod (corporate/securities) and Gilles Carli (tax).
