We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
shareholders.


The market for software solutions is constantly evolving and extremely 
competitive. We expect competition to intensify in the future. We compete with 
major domestic companies. Many of these competitors have greater market 
recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, 
distribution, and other resources than we have, and we may be unable to compete 
effectively against them. Emerging companies also may increase their 
participation in the market for software applications such as that offered by 
the Company. 

We provide time and attendance, data collection and labor management solutions 
that enable businesses to optimize their labor resources. The labor management 
industry is highly competitive. Competition is increasing as businesses in 
related industries, such as human resources management, payroll processing and 
enterprise resource planning enter the time and attendance market. Advances in 
software development tools have accelerated the software development process 
and, therefore, enable competitors to penetrate our markets more readily. 
Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our 
current competitors, maintaining those advantages will require continued 
investment by the Company in research and development and marketing and sales 
initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources 
to make such investments or to achieve the technological advances necessary to 
maintain our competitive advantages. Increased competition could adversely 
affect our operating results through price reductions and/or loss of market 
share. 

We compete primarily on the basis of price/performance, quality, reliability and 
customer service. In the time and attendance market, we compete against firms 
that sell automated time and attendance products to many industries, firms that 
focus on specific industries, and firms selling related products, such as 
payroll processing, human resources management, or ERP systems. Our major 
competitor, Kronos Corporation, is substantially larger and has access to 
significantly greater financial resources than the Company. Competitive market 
conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.


Company Description
Time America, Inc. was organized in 1988 as a Nevada corporation under the name 
Richard Barrie Fragrances, Inc. Since our formation we have undergone a number 
of changes to our corporate name and to the nature of the business we conduct. 
We entered the time and attendance industry in 1999 when


 we acquired the 
outstanding capital stock of Vitrix Incorporated, a privately held Arizona 
corporation formed in 1996, which became our only operating subsidiary. In 2001, 
we acquired Time America, Inc. through the merger of that entity into our 
subsidiary Vitrix Incorporated. In 2003, we changed our name from Vitrix, Inc. 
to Time America, Inc. to capitalize on the 13-year history and name recognition 
of Time America in the time and attendance industry. 

We develop, manufacture and market a line of time and labor management software 
and hardware products which are designed to improve productivity by automating 
time and attendance, workforce scheduling and management of labor resources. Our 
product solutions are designed for use by a broad range of businesses, from 
small single location companies with only a few employees to enterprise level 
companies with multiple sites and thousands of employees. 

Our products are internally developed, proprietary software applications that 
maintain and automate the process of collecting timesheet information, provide 
interfaces to popular payroll software solutions and enable users to generate a 
variety of reports that aid in the tracking and analyzing of how employees 
utilize their work time. Our product solutions use a variety of technologies, 
including products that are delivered through a 100% Web-based application 
service provider model, as well as client/server and PC-based applications. Our 
current products include: 

• NETtime—is a 100% Web-based service deliverable to users through both a 
licensed and application service provider model. 

• HourTrack—is a powerful workforce management solution that combines 
client/server software with a wide range of data collection devices designed to 
automate the process of tracking, managing, auditing, and reporting employee 
time and attendance. 

• GENESIS SQL—is an enterprise level software that helps clients optimize 
productivity and more effectively manage their bottom line by automating not 
only time and attendance, but job costing, benefit administration, employee 
review processing, access control, bell ringing and data collection needs. 

• TA50 PRO—is a simple to use yet powerful time and attendance solution designed 
for companies with fewer than 200 employees. It enables users to automate their 
timekeeping and attendance tracking with built-in setup wizards and simplified 
daily operations. 

• TA50XL—is also a simple to use time and attendance solution that includes the 
software features of TA50 PRO and an XL data terminal and accessories in a cost-
effective package. 

• TA100 PRO—is a time and attendance solution designed for companies with fewer 
than 500 employees. This product allows users to automatically calculate 
employee time and wages using the client's specific payroll policies. 

• GENESIS PRO—is an enterprise level PC-based software application that has the 
same feature set as GENESIS SQL. 

We market our products to companies in the U.S. and abroad through our direct 
sales and support organization and through our Business Alliance and Reseller 
Program. Our direct sales and reseller sales efforts accounted for approximately 
38% and 62%, respectively, of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2003, and 37% and 67%, respectively, for the quarterly period ended 
September 30, 2003, which is the first quarter of our 2004 fiscal year. 

Market Opportunity 

We believe the market for time and labor management software and hardware 
products is large and growing. There are currently no definitive figures on the 
market size of the time and attendance market. 

Growth Strategy 

We have a long history of providing high quality time and labor management 
products to our targeted markets. Our goal is to maintain and strengthen our 
market position. We intend to pursue the following growth strategies to attain 
this goal: 

• Expand Direct Sales Organization. We have recently added regional direct sales 
personnel in key geographic regions to bolster our direct sales efforts. We feel 
having a local presence is key to increasing our direct sales output. 

• Leveraged Distribution. We plan to continue to sign strategic partners to 
enable us to do rapid and wide-scale private label distribution of our products. 

• Introduction of New Technologies. The Company will continue to introduce and 
expand into new technologies that will differentiate us from our competitors. 

• Expand through Mergers and Acquisitions. The Company plans to enter into 
mergers and acquisitions with target companies that provide complimentary 
products, markets or distributions channels to the Company. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 51 West Third Street, Suite 310, 
Tempe, Arizona 85281. Our telephone number is (480) 296-0442. We wholly own our 
only subsidiary, Time America, Inc., an Arizona corporation.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with our audited financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016.  Overview  Acquisition of iMetabolic Corp.  On December 31, 2014, we entered into an Agreement of Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization (the "Share Exchange Agreement") and consummated a share exchange (the "Share Exchange") with iMetabolic Corp. ("IMET"), a Nevada corporation.  As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, the IMET shareholders transferred all their interest in IMET to the Company and, as a result, IMET became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  As a further condition of the Share Exchange Agreement, the then current officers of the Company resigned on March 16, 2015 and Mark W. Conte was appointed President, CEO and a director of the Company, Kevin J. Pikero as CFO, Treasurer, Secretary, and a director and Andrew D. Smith as a director.  The IMET acquisition is discussed more fully in the Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 20, 2015. Included as an exhibit to that Form 8-K is a copy of the Share Exchange Agreement.  Name Change  On December 30, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Merger (the "Merger") with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Merger was between the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, UPD Holding Corp. (the "Subsidiary"). Pursuant to Nevada corporate law, we amended our Articles of Incorporation by the Merger to change our name to UPD Holding Corp. We believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business because the Company has not been in the water and beverage industry since 2012. "UPD" stands for United Product Development which is the name of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We will be applying to FINRA to have our common stock traded under the new name and for a new trading symbol as soon as possible.  IMET Products  IMET was formed on July 1, 2013 for the purpose of marketing products under the brand "iMetabolic" that were previously being sold by the brand's licensor, International Metabolic Institute LLC ("IMI"), as well as to develop new products that would be specifically suited for a national marketing plan. IMI transferred certain product and trademark rights to IMET on July 22, 2013 (the "License"). The License was amended on March 16, 2015 to clarify IMET's and IMI's future rights. See "IMET License Agreement" below. The mission of IMET is to build upon preexisting brand equity and the expert copy and other literature authored by Dr. Kent Sasse as applied to the national launch of products with extraordinary profitability and novel market appeal.  A pre-existing line of five (5) soft-bound books authored by the founder of the iMetabolic brand, Dr. Kent Sasse, is available for sale under the brand "A Sasse Guide" on both the www.imetabolic.com and www.sasseguide.com websites. These books are titled: (i) Life-Changing Weight Loss; (ii) Doctor's Orders - 101 Medically Proven Tips for Losing Weight; (iii) Outpatient Weight Loss Surgery - Safe and Successful Weight Loss with Modern Bariatric Surgery; (iv) Weight-Loss Surgery - Which One is Right for You?; and (v) After Weight Loss Surgery.  A pre-existing line of products, including, but not limited to, proprietary blend meal replacements, dietary specialty foods, and nutraceuticals, have been sold by IMI at IMI's company store / doctor's office pursuant to a reservation of rights in the License and online at www.imetabolic.com. An amendment to the License provides that after IMI has sold its entire inventory existing or ordered on March 16, 2015, IMI will not sell any more products which may be deemed to compete with IMET's products.  Table of Contents  IMET has developed the following four new products to be marketed:   A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic "Catalyst", which is intended to provide the essential vitamins and plant compounds that are necessary to aid in metabolic functions. Such ingredients include broad spectrum B-Complex Vitamins, as well as Green Tea Extract and Resveratrol (polyphenols).   A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic "Mini-Meal", which is intended to provide the essential whey protein isolate intake for a person who is on a four-to-five meal per day diet or needs a snack that will act as a low-calorie, high nutritional value appetite suppressant.   A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic "Multi-Pro", which is intended to provide the essential broad-spectrum vitamins and minerals that are typically marketed as "multi-vitamin supplements;" however, this product is specifically tailored to dovetail with the "Catalyst" so as to virtually eliminate the duplicate consumption of overlapping ingredients that routinely plagues supplement users.   A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic "BittX." This product is premised on the scientific theory that modern horticulture and food producers have systematically promoted foods that are sweet or lack bitterness, which is the flavor typically associated with foods that have the greatest health benefits. Accordingly, this product is intended to reform the body's disposition toward bitter foods in a subtle, inoffensive way.  We believe IMET's current four products can be successfully marketed through the use of infomercials and have made progress with identifying a creator and producer for an infomercial to sell the products. Additionally, the Company is building a new website with e-commerce capabilities and plans to use SEO (search engine optimization), social media, e-mail marketing, and PPC (pay for click) venues as well to drive the business. However, there is no assurance IMET's infomercial marketing strategy will be successful.  We have also investigated using regional distributors for our products and may use them in the future, on a region by region basis as working capital permits. The Company has identified some prospects and is working to move those prospects forward.  We believe IMET has located experienced nutrition and supplemental manufacturers who have indicated an interest and an ability to manufacture IMET's initial four products. We have received written cost quotations from these manufactures and production timetables, as well. The Company is in the process of evaluating the best venue to move forward.  The Company was hopeful that it was going to be able to secure its new website, marketing program, and product manufacturing schedules to begin marketing our products within six months of the closing of the Exchange. In reality, these details are taking more time to prepare and thus the Company is now targeting some initial product and marketing launches in 2016 - 2017.  IMET License Agreement  IMET entered into a license with IMI, a Nevada limited liability company, on July 22, 2013 (the "License"). In the License, IMI granted to IMET the exclusive licenses to use, produce, market and sell: (i) five marks (the "Licensed Marks"); (ii) four books written by Dr. Sasse (the "Licensed Content"); and (iii) approximately 150 supplements and foods created and previously sold by IMI (the "Licensed Articles"). The Licensed Marks include the trademark "iMetabolic"; the domain name "www.imetabolic.com"; the trademark "iMetabolic Catalyst"; and a trademark and domain name related to Dr. Sasse.  In conjunction with closing the Exchange, on March 16, 2015 IMI and IMET executed an amendment to the License (the "License Amendment"). In the License Amendment: (i) IMET returned to IMI all rights to the Licensed Content (Dr. Sasse's books), the two Dr. Sasse Licensed Marks and all revenues from the sale of the Licensed Articles since July 1, 2013 through the date of closing the Exchange; (ii) the Initial Term was increased from three to four years; (iii) a provision was added stating that after the closing of the Exchange, IMI shall not sell any more of the Licensed Articles or any other products IMET deems as competing with the Licensed Articles; (iv) a provision was added stating that upon reaching the $3.0 Million milestone, IMI shall transfer and or assign to IMET the three remaining Licensed Marks; and (v) a provision was added stating that upon completion of the Initial Term, IMET shall have all rights, obligations, and burdens of enforcing the Licensed Marks.  During 2014, the trademark "iMetabolic" expired at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In conjunction with the closing of the Exchange, IMI re-applied for that trademark and the service mark "iMetabolic" on December 16, 2014. In May 2015, we engaged Drinker, Biddle & Reath, LLP to correspond with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office regarding our application. As of April 19, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 4,941,531 in the Class 5 Category. Additionally, on September 6, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 5,034,186 in the Class 44 Category. At this juncture, the Company has succeeded in reclaiming both marks for consideration in its future operations.  Table of Contents  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  General and Administrative Expenses  For the three months ended December 31, 2106 and 2015, we have recorded operating expenses of $17,847 and $24,197, respectively, consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses along with professional fees all of which are associated with maintaining the Company as a publicly traded entity.  For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded operating expenses of $30,862 and $36,789, respectively, consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses along with professional fees all of which are associated with maintaining the Company as a publicly traded entity.  Net Loss  For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded a net loss of $50,346 and $24,193, respectively.  For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded a net loss of $74,194 and $36,775, respectively.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  At December 31, 2016, the Company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had current assets of $68,712 current liabilities of $149,318, and a working capital deficit of $80,606.  On September 1, 2016, through unanimous approval by its Board, the Company opened a $65,000 escrow to initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands. This $65,000 escrow was funded by two private placements which have convertible notes associated with them (the "Notes"). The Company's efforts to secure funding are continuing and the Company is hopeful, without assurance, that substantial funding will be obtained in the near future.  The Notes are convertible on March 1, 2017 at $0.0125 per share. If share conversion is not elected, then interest will be due on the Notes in the amount of $65,000. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a total of 5,200,000 shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. $15,000 of the $65,000 private placement was funded by the Company's President.  Over the next twelve months, we have estimated that in order to maintain reporting company status as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we will require cash for general and administrative expenses and professional fees, which include accounting, legal and other professional fees, as well as filing fees. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents or additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed or at all, or that such capital, if available, will be on acceptable terms. In the absence of obtaining additional financing, we may be unable to fund our operations. As a result, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm has issued going concern opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  During the six months ended December 31, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements set forth in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Note 1, "Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016, describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by management on a regular basis.  Table of Contents  New Accounting Pronouncements  Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 


	The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” or “anticipates,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties.  Investors are cautioned that these forward-looking statements that are not historical facts are only predictions.  No assurances can be given that the future results indicated, whether expressed or implied, will be achieved. Because of the number and range of assumptions underlying the Company’s projections and forward-looking statements, many of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond the reasonable control of the Company, some of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date of this report.  These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation to update this information.  Therefore, the actual experience of the Company and the results achieved during the period covered by any particular projections or forward-looking statements may differ substantially from those projected.  The inclusion of projections and other forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that these estimates and projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially.  There can be no assurance that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will prove to be accurate.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	 


	 


	NOTE 1 – BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES; GOING CONCERN


	 


	Business, Operations and Organization


	 


	Esio Water & Beverage Development Corp. was incorporated in Nevada in June 1988 as Richard Barrie Fragrances, Inc. Over the years, the Company changed its name several times, most recently from Tempco, Inc. to Esio Water & Beverage Development Corp. Esio Water & Beverage Development Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Net Edge Devices, LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company, and iMetabolic Corp, (“IMET”) a Nevada Corporation are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Company.”


	 


	On March 16, 2015, the Company issued to the IMET 16 shareholders of record an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares, or 76.2% of the Company’s common stock. Prior to the close of the reverse merger, IMET had 10,000,000 common shares outstanding immediately prior to the merger and net liabilities of $20,500. Prior to closing, the predecessor company had 18,566,636 shares outstanding and net assets of $89,615, of which $85,378 was cash and $4,237 was non-cash. As a result of the closing of this transaction, IMET is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and its business and operations represent those of the Company


	 


	For accounting purposes, this transaction is being accounted for as a reverse merger and has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company with IMET considered the accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of the accounting acquirer become the financial statements of the registrant. This transaction is hereinafter referred to as the “Reverse Merger.” The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with the transaction. The 60,000,000 common shares issued to the shareholders of IMET in conjunction with the share exchange transaction have been presented as outstanding for all periods.


	 


	On December 30, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Merger (the “Merger”) with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Merger was between the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, UPD Holding Corp. (the “Subsidiary”). Pursuant to Nevada corporate law, we amended our Articles of Incorporation by the Merger to change our name to UPD Holding Corp. We believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business because the Company has not been in the water and beverage industry since 2012. “UPD” stands for United Product Development.


	 


	Beneficial Conversion Feature





	The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.


	 


	Going Concern


	 


	The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.





	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to obtain such resources for the Company include (i) obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses; (ii) obtaining funding from outside sources through the sale of its debt and/or equity securities; and (iii) completing a merger with or acquisition of an existing operating company. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

	Unaudited Interim Financial Statements


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are unaudited. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented have been made. The results for the three month period ended December 31, 2016, may not be indicative of the results for the entire year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016.


	 


	The preparation of the Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.


	 


	NOTE 2 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 


	For the six months ended December 31, 2016, the President has provided the Company rent at no charge.


	 


	On September 1, 2016, through unanimous approval by its Board, the Company opened an escrow to initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands. The related party portion of this escrow consists of a $15,000 convertible Note held by the Company’s President which matures March 1, 2017. If not repaid by maturity, the note is convertible into 1,200,000 common shares at $0.0125 per share. If share conversion is not elected, then interest will be due in the amount of $15,000.





	The Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,

	“Derivatives and Hedging”

	and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting.


	 


	The Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and determined that the instrument does have a beneficial conversion feature equivalent. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.


	 


	NOTE 3 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY


	 


	Authorized Shares


	 


	At December 31, 2016, our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of $.005, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $.01. The Company’s Board of Directors has the authority to divide the preferred stock shares into series and to fix the voting powers, designation, preference, and relative participating, option or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of the shares of any series so established. 


	 


	Common Stock


	 


	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were 79,766,636 and 78,766,636 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively.


	 


	At December 31, 2016, we had a total of 9,508,245 shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the 1,352,767 outstanding options and 8,155,478 outstanding warrants issued by the predecessor company. See

	“Options and Warrants”

	below for additional information.


	 


	On July 1, 2016 the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at $0.025 per share in a private placement to raise additional working capital.

	The Company did not issue any options or warrants during the six months ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	As of March 16, 2015, the effective date of the Reverse Merger, the Company had 3,522,767 options outstanding pursuant to the predecessor company’s 1999 Equity Compensation Plan, of which 2,170,000 options have expired, leaving 1,352,767 options outstanding as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	In addition, as of the effective date of the Reverse Merger, the Company had 8,155,478 warrants outstanding issued by the predecessor company. These warrants expire in 2017.


	 


	Additional information about the predecessor company’s options and warrants and expense calculations can be found in that company’s financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 14, 2014 and in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016.


	 


	NOTE 4 – CONVERTIBLE NOTE


	 


	On September 1, 2016, through unanimous approval by its Board, the Company opened an escrow to initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands. A single private placement provided $50,000 of this escrow in the form of a convertible note. This convertible note matures on March 1, 2017. If not repaid by maturity, the note is convertible into 4,000,000 common shares at $0.0125 per share. If share conversion is not elected, then interest will be due at the face value of the original note of $50,000.


	 


	The Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,

	“Derivatives and Hedging”

	and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting.


	 


	The Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and determined that the instrument does have a beneficial conversion feature equivalent.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations





	 


	The following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with our audited financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016.


	 


	Overview


	 


	Acquisition of iMetabolic Corp.


	 


	On December 31

	,

	2014, we entered into an Agreement of Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) and consummated a share exchange (the “Share Exchange”) with iMetabolic Corp. (“IMET”), a Nevada corporation.  The Effective Date of the transaction was March 16, 2015 (the “Effective Date”) and resulted in the acquisition of IMET (the “Acquisition”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of IMET from the 16 IMET shareholders for an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares, or 76.2% of the Company’s common stock.


	 


	As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, the IMET shareholders transferred all their interest in IMET to the Company and, as a result, IMET became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	As a further condition of the Share Exchange Agreement, the then current officers of the Company resigned on March 16, 2015 and Mark W. Conte was appointed President, CEO and a director of the Company, Kevin J. Pikero as CFO, Treasurer, Secretary, and a director and Andrew D. Smith as a director.


	 


	The IMET acquisition is discussed more fully in the Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 20, 2015. Included as an exhibit to that Form 8-K is a copy of the Share Exchange Agreement.


	 


	Name Change


	 


	On December 30, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Merger (the “Merger”) with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Merger was between the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, UPD Holding Corp. (the “Subsidiary”). Pursuant to Nevada corporate law, we amended our Articles of Incorporation by the Merger to change our name to UPD Holding Corp. We believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business because the Company has not been in the water and beverage industry since 2012. “UPD” stands for United Product Development which is the name of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We will be applying to FINRA to have our common stock traded under the new name and for a new trading symbol as soon as possible.


	 


	IMET Products


	 


	IMET was  formed on July 1, 2013 for the purpose of marketing products under the brand “iMetabolic” that were previously being sold by the brand’s licensor, International Metabolic Institute LLC (“IMI”), as well as to develop new products that would be specifically suited for a national marketing plan.  IMI transferred certain product and trademark rights to IMET on July 22, 2013 (the “License”).  The License was amended on March 16, 2015 to clarify IMET’s and IMI’s future rights. See

	“IMET License Agreement”

	below. The mission of IMET is to build upon preexisting brand equity and the expert copy and other literature authored by Dr. Kent Sasse as applied to the national launch of products with extraordinary profitability and novel market appeal.


	 


	A pre-existing line of five (5) soft-bound books authored by the founder of the iMetabolic brand, Dr. Kent Sasse, is available for sale under the brand “A Sasse Guide” on both the www.imetabolic.com and www.sasseguide.com websites. These books are titled: (i) Life-Changing Weight Loss; (ii) Doctor’s Orders – 101 Medically Proven Tips for Losing Weight; (iii) Outpatient Weight Loss Surgery – Safe and Successful Weight Loss with Modern Bariatric Surgery; (iv) Weight-Loss Surgery – Which One is Right for You?; and (v) After Weight Loss Surgery.  Pursuant to the terms of the License Amendment these books will continue to be the property of and sold by IMI. 


	 


	A pre-existing line of products, including, but not limited to, proprietary blend meal replacements, dietary specialty foods, and nutraceuticals, have been sold by IMI at IMI’s company store / doctor’s office pursuant to a reservation of rights in the License and online at www.imetabolic.com.  An amendment to the License provides that after IMI has sold its entire inventory existing or ordered on March 16, 2015, IMI will not sell any more products which may be deemed to compete with IMET’s products.

	A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic “Mini-Meal”, which is intended to provide the essential whey protein isolate intake for a person who is on a four-to-five meal per day diet or needs a snack that will act as a low-calorie, high nutritional value appetite suppressant.





	 





	 




	•




	A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic “Multi-Pro”, which is intended to provide the essential broad-spectrum vitamins and minerals that are typically marketed as “multi-vitamin supplements;” however, this product is specifically tailored to dovetail with the “Catalyst” so as to virtually eliminate the duplicate consumption of overlapping ingredients that routinely plagues supplement users.





	 





	 




	•




	A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic “BittX.” This product is premised on the scientific theory that modern horticulture and food producers have systematically promoted foods that are sweet or lack bitterness, which is the flavor typically associated with foods that have the greatest health benefits. Accordingly, this product is intended to reform the body’s disposition toward bitter foods in a subtle, inoffensive way.






	 


	We believe IMET’s current four products can be successfully marketed through the use of infomercials and have made progress with identifying a creator and producer for an infomercial to sell the products. Additionally, the Company is building a new website with e-commerce capabilities and plans to use SEO (search engine optimization), social media, e-mail marketing, and PPC (pay for click) venues as well to drive the business. However, there is no assurance IMET’s infomercial marketing strategy will be successful.


	 


	We have also investigated using regional distributors for our products and may use them in the future, on a region by region basis as working capital permits. The Company has identified some prospects and is working to move those prospects forward.


	 


	We believe IMET has located experienced nutrition and supplemental manufacturers who have indicated an interest and an ability to manufacture IMET’s initial four products.  We have received written cost quotations from these manufactures and production timetables, as well. The Company is in the process of evaluating the best venue to move forward.


	 


	The Company was hopeful that it was going to be able to secure its new website, marketing program, and product manufacturing schedules to begin marketing our products within six months of the closing of the Exchange. In reality, these details are taking more time to prepare and thus the Company is now targeting some initial product and marketing launches in 2016 – 2017.


	 


	IMET License Agreement


	 


	IMET entered into a license with IMI, a Nevada limited liability company, on July 22, 2013 (the “License”).  In the License, IMI granted to IMET the exclusive licenses to use, produce, market and sell: (i) five marks (the “Licensed Marks”); (ii) four books written by Dr. Sasse (the “Licensed Content”); and (iii) approximately 150 supplements and foods created and previously sold by IMI (the “Licensed Articles”).  The Licensed Marks include the trademark “iMetabolic”; the domain name “www.imetabolic.com”; the trademark “iMetabolic Catalyst”; and a trademark and domain name related to Dr. Sasse.  The License had a term of three years, commencing on July 1, 2013 (the “Initial Term”), with a provision stating that the term of the License would automatically become perpetual if IMET sold $3.0 Million of Licensed Content or Licensed Articles before July 1, 2016. IMET is to bear all expenses of the creation and sale of the Licensed Content and Licensed Articles.  The License contains other provisions standard in licenses.


	 


	In conjunction with closing the Exchange, on March 16, 2015 IMI and IMET executed an amendment to the License (the “License Amendment”). In the License Amendment: (i) IMET returned to IMI all rights to the Licensed Content (Dr. Sasse’s books), the two Dr. Sasse Licensed Marks and all revenues from the sale of the Licensed Articles since July 1, 2013 through the date of closing the Exchange; (ii) the Initial Term was increased from three to four years; (iii) a provision was added stating that after the closing of the Exchange, IMI shall not sell any more of the Licensed Articles or any other products IMET deems as competing with the Licensed Articles; (iv) a provision was added stating that upon reaching the $3.0 Million milestone, IMI shall transfer and or assign to IMET the three remaining Licensed Marks; and (v) a provision was added stating that upon completion of the Initial Term, IMET shall have all rights, obligations, and burdens of enforcing the Licensed Marks.


	 


	During 2014, the trademark “iMetabolic” expired at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  In conjunction with the closing of the Exchange, IMI re-applied for that trademark and the service mark "iMetabolic" on December 16, 2014.  In May 2015, we engaged Drinker, Biddle & Reath, LLP to correspond with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office regarding our application.  As of April 19, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 4,941,531 in the Class 5 Category. Additionally, on September 6, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 5,034,186 in the Class 44 Category. At this juncture, the Company has succeeded in reclaiming both marks for consideration in its future operations.

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 


	General and Administrative Expenses


	 


	For the three months ended December 31, 2106 and 2015, we have recorded operating expenses of $17,847 and $24,197, respectively, consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses along with professional fees all of which are associated with maintaining the Company as a publicly traded entity.





	For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded operating expenses of $30,862 and $36,789, respectively, consisting primarily of general and administrative expenses along with professional fees all of which are associated with maintaining the Company as a publicly traded entity.


	 


	Net Loss


	 


	For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded a net loss of $50,346 and $24,193, respectively.





	For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded a net loss of $74,194 and $36,775, respectively.


	 


	Liquidity and Capital Resources 


	 


	At December 31, 2016, the Company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had current assets of $68,712 current liabilities of $149,318, and a working capital deficit of $80,606.






	On September 1, 2016, through unanimous approval by its Board, the Company opened a $65,000 escrow to initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands. This $65,000 escrow was funded by two private placements which have convertible notes associated with them (the “Notes”). 

	The Company's efforts to secure funding are continuing and the Company is hopeful, without assurance, that substantial funding will be obtained in the near future.


	 








	The Notes are convertible on March 1, 2017 at $0.0125 per share. If share conversion is not elected, then interest will be due on the Notes in the amount of $65,000. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a total of 5,200,000 shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. $15,000 of the $65,000 private placement was funded by the Company’s President.


	 


	Over the next twelve months, we have estimated that in order to maintain reporting company status as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we will require cash for general and administrative expenses and professional fees, which include accounting, legal and other professional fees, as well as filing fees. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents or additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed or at all, or that such capital, if available, will be on acceptable terms. In the absence of obtaining additional financing, we may be unable to fund our operations. As a result, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued going concern opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.


	 


	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


	 


	During the six months ended December 31, 2016, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements set forth in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K. 


	 


	Critical Accounting Policies


	 


	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.

	Note 1

	, “

	Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

	” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016, describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by management on a regular basis.

	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk





	 


	Our exposure to market risks is limited to changes in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short-term investments. Accordingly, we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time.



	 










	Item 4.




	Controls and Procedures





	 


	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures


	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the size and nature of the existing business operation. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until the organization can increase in size to warrant an increase in personnel, formal internal control procedure will not be implemented until they can be effectively executed and monitored. As a result of the size of the current organization, there will not be significant levels of supervision, review, independent directors nor formal audit committee.


	 


	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


	 


	During the quarter ended December 31, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
