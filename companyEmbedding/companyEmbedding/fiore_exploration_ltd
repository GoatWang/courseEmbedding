Creating wealth with gold in the Americas 

 

watch video 

 


 



  
About Fiore
Fiore Exploration Ltd.’s objective is to acquire undervalued exploration and development-stage mineral assets in the Americas, beginning with a strategic land position around Yamana’s high-grade El Peñon mine in Chile. With global mineral exploration budgets at less than half of their 2012 peak, Fiore’s experienced management team has an unparalleled opportunity to acquire world-class assets across a number of mining-friendly jurisdictions. The fall-off in exploration spending has also drastically reduced exploration costs, and made high-quality exploration staff and contractors readily available for the first time in many years.
Yamana’s El Peñon mine produced 227,000 ounces of gold and 7.7 million ounces of silver in 2015 with reported cash costs of US$621 and $8.38 an ounce respectively (Yamana Gold 2015 Annual Report). Fiore’s Pampas El Peñon properties lie immediately west, south and north of the northernmost portion of Yamana’s El Peñon deposit, known as the Pampas Augusta Victoria Complex. Our Cerro Tostado project is located just south of the Mina Fortuna and Main El Peñon complexes.
In addition to our projects adjacent to the El Peñon mine, Fiore is in discussions to acquire additional projects in Chile and elsewhere in the Americas which the company believes hold excellent potential for discoveries.
Fiore Exploration is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the trading symbol "F".

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree
