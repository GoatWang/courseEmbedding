Obituary: Paul G. Nettle, 66, of Shelton

By Shelton Herald on November 4, 2013 in Obituaries · 0 Comments




Paul G. Nettle, 66, of Shelton entered into rest on November 2, 2013, at the Veteran Hospital in West Haven with his loving family by his side.  He was the devoted husband of 48 years to Marian (Spodnick) Nettle.
He was born in Bridgeport on June 26, 1947 son of the late Hugh and Mary (Fedock) Nettle and was a Shelton resident for 42 years.
Paul was employed as a Route Salesman for over 30 years by Drake Bakeries before his retirement in 2004.
Paul was an avid fan of the NY Mets, NY Giants, UCONN Men and Women Basketball. He also was an animal lover.
Paul was a proud veteran serving in the US Navy during the Vietnam War.
He is the beloved father of Paul G. Nettle, Jr.,  Robert Nettle and his wife Dana, Cara Recce and her husband John, and Jeffrey Nettle.  The proud grandfather of Jessica and Brendon Recce, Amanda and Ryan Nettle, Derek and Dylan Banks-Nettle, who were the light of his life.   He is also survived by two brothers Frank Nettle and his wife Lorraine and John Nettle and his wife Carol and several nieces and nephews.
Friends are invited to attend a Mass of Christian Burial on Wednesday at 9:00 AM in St. Joseph Church, 424 Coram Rd., Shelton.   His burial service will be held at 2:00 PM in the State Veteran Cemetery 317 Bow Lane  Middletown.  Per Paul’s request, there will be no calling hours.  The Riverview Funeral Home, 390 River Rd. Shelton has been entrusted with his services.
The family would like to express their sincerest gratitude to the V.A. Hospital for their many years of kind and compassionate care, especially Dr. Jackie Satchel and the nursing staff at MICU.
Please leave condolences to his family at www.riverviewfh.com.
