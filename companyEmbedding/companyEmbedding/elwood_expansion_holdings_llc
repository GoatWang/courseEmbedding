Elwood Energy, Exelon Generation sign long-term PPA








04/23/2001









































CHICAGO, April 20, 2001  Elwood Energy, LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Peoples Energy Corporation and Dominion, today announced a multi-year power purchase agreement with Exelon Generation Company, LLC, for the remaining 150-megawatt output of Elwood's phase II expansion of its gas-fired, peaking facility.  This agreement supplements existing power sales arrangements between Elwood Energy and Commonwealth Edison Company, which transferred its interests to Exelon Generation Company, LLC.Exelon Generation also entered into an agreement to purchase 750 megawatts of generation from Elwood for the period of 2005 until 2012."We have successfully contracted all of the capacity for the phase II expansion, which is scheduled to come online in June," said Thomas Patrick, president and chief operating officer of Peoples Energy.  "This arrangement helps to ensure the continued growth of Elwood.""With this agreement, Dominion Energy has taken another critical step forward in its plan to become a leading energy provider in the Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, home to 40 percent of the nation's demand for energy," said Thomas F. Farrell, chief executive officer of Dominion Energy.  "Our facility at Elwood is an increasingly important anchor for Dominion in this area of the nation.""We are excited about adding this product into our portfolio of reliable resources in this region and look forward to our continuing relationship with Elwood," said Ian McLean, president, Exelon Power Team, the wholesale marketing division of Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC).[Native Advertisement]When the expanded facility becomes operational this summer, it will more than double the capacity of Elwood's existing 600-megawatt merchant facility, bringing the site's total capacity to 1,350 MW.  Elwood began operation in the summer of 1999.  The facility, which is located 60 miles southwest of Chicago in Elwood, Illinois, will expand to nine natural gas-fired turbines from four turbines.  Construction of the expanded project commenced in October 2000 and is entering final testing in the next several weeks.The facility is adjacent to multiple interstate natural gas pipelines that provide access to competitively priced gas supplies from all major gas producing regions of the United States.  The facility is also close to a high capacity ComEd transmission corridor that provides access to the wholesale electric market.Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Va., is one of the nation's largest producers of energy, with production capability of 2.7 trillion British Thermal Units of energy per day.  Dominion has a power generation portfolio of more than 21,000 megawatts, which is expected to grow to more than 28,000 megawatts by 2005.  Dominion is also one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in North America, with 2.8 trillion cubic feet of equivalent reserves.  The company has 7,600 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline with more than 650 billion cubic feet of annual natural gas throughput. Dominion also serves 3.8 million retail natural gas and electric customers.  (http://www.dom.com ).Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with approximately five million customers and more than $15 billion in annual revenues.  The company has one of the industry's largest portfolios of electricity generation capacity, with a nationwide reach and strong positions in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.  Exelon distributes electricity and gas to approximately five million customers in Illinois and Pennsylvania.  The company also has holdings in such competitive businesses as energy, infrastructure services and energy services.  Exelon is headquartered in Chicago and trades on the NYSE under the ticker EXC.
