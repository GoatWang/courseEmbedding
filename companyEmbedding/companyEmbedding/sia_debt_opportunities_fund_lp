Supporting
entrepreneurship and
innovation in Europe What we do
Our central mission is to support Europe's small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) by helping them to access finance. To this end, we aim at satisfying existing and future market needs by designing innovative financial products addressed to our partners (banks, guarantee, leasing and microfinance institutions, private equity and venture capital funds, among others), acting as our financial intermediaries. 
By offering an Integrated Risk Finance Product Range of SME finance to our intermediaries, we complement the products offered by the European Investment Bank (EIB) with which we form the EIB Group.





Equity Products
We invest in venture capital and growth funds,  mezzanine funds that support SMEs. Our investment activities also cover technology transfer and business incubators.



Debt products
Our clients are a wide range of financial intermediaries, such as banks, mutual guarantee funds, leasing companies and special purpose vehicles providing  funding to beneficiary SMEs.




Microfinance
We provide funding (equity and loans), guarantees and technical assistance to a broad range of micro-credit providers, from non-bank financial institutions to well established banks to make microfinance a fully-fledged segment of the European financial sector.




While our equity instruments aim to improve the availability of risk capital for high-growth and innovative SMEs, we also target the debt requirements, as many SMEs seek finance through this more traditional route. Therefore we also provide guarantees and credit enhancement through securitisation to improve the lending capacity of our financial intermediaries and thus the availability and terms of debt for beneficiary SMEs. We carry out our activities in the European Union (EU) Member States, in EU Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries and in the European Free Trade Association Countries.
Data Protection
All Applicants and Financial Intermediaries are identified through an appropriate Know-Your-Customer process in line with the EIB Group Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism Framework and the Regulations applicable from time to time.
EIF is committed to processing any personal data the Applicants and the Financial Intermediaries share in the context of (including but not limited to) their application to EIF Calls for Expression of Interest in line with its Data Protection Statement.
