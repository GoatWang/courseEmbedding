History Books

Whether it happened last month or centuries ago, it's history, and our stellar supply of History Books can guide you through the entirety of human experience. From the regal to the ridiculous, the obscure to the unavoidable, you'll uncover information about any piece of the past that strikes your fancy. Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States? Check. Stephen Ambrose's Undaunted Courage? All yours. Elie Wiesel's Night? Right here. You can probably even read about the history of history books if you want.




1776: America and Britain at War
Relive America's first flush of freedom. History buffs will wet their pants at the unprecedented amount of revelatory info heavyweight historian David McCullough provides here about the year the U.S. claimed its independence from England. But anyone intrigued with the way human passions and politics interact will find themselves fascinated when 1776 really digs deep and lets you know what it was like to be around for the Revolutionary War.

 "And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." -Ephesians 6:4A Puritan Bible Primer is a guide ...for parents to train young children to receive instruction in God's truth. This primer includes "The Disciple's Prayer," "Books of the Bible," "A Primer Catechism," a General Confession of Faith, poems, and selected hymns and psalms.--The Disciple's Prayer, also known as The Lord's Prayer, is a blessed model for our children to learn how to pray, as well as a model for parents to instruct the children in the various facets and graces of prayer in, by and through our crucified, risen and ascended Lord.--Knowing the books in the Bible is an essential primer for the young children (as well as the young in Christ), because knowing where to turn in the Bible when the preacher mentions a passage of Scripture is so very important.--"A Primer Catechism" is a simpler form of questions and answers than those found in A Puritan Family Devotional or A Pilgrim Family Devotional. Nevertheless, the blessed truths gleaned from this catechism will plant many seeds of Biblical truth in the heart of the child, as well as prepare the child to join the family in catechism recitation, be it Mr. Spurgeon's A Puritan Catechism, the Westminster Shorter Catechism, or the Heidelberg Catechism.--The generic General Confession of Faith contained in this little volume allow for the use of this resource by families regardless of the denomination of their Reformed and Evangelical Faith: Baptist, Presbyterian, Congregational, Reformed, Lutheran, etc.--Poems paraphrasing the scripture or placing doctrinal, experiential or practical truths in meter or rhyme will bring joy to your children as they learn the scriptures and its truth in metrical form.--The seven selected hymns and seven selected psalms from the Scottish Psalter are the very same found in A Puritan Family Devotional and A Pilgrim Family Devotional. The Primer truly serves as a basic and fundamental resource to prepare our children to read the scriptures in their own devotional times.

From the Author


When I was missionary in bush Alaska, I knew that if the Lord would have mercy upon His people, to bring revival in a cold and remote land, it would be by His grace alone according to His good pleasure. Man cannot manufacture revival; nor can he manipulate God in any way to bring revival to pass. Nevertheless, our Savior and Sovereign has ordained means by which He accomplishes His will, presenting His ways according to His Word. That being so, ministers of God were responsible, by God's grace, to employ those means to the fullest extent possible and permissible in order to exalt Christ and bestow upon God the greatest glory redeemed souls could offer.Therefore, in Scammon Bay, I began piecing together what would soon become A Puritan Family Devotional. For those who were already in the congregation, kept by God's grace in His Word and on His way, it was necessary to encourage daily Bible readings in the home. Expositional and expository preaching and teaching is wonderful; but if it causes the congregation to be lulled into finding satisfaction in the study and meditation of God's Word only once or twice per week when it is preached from the pulpit, we have failed as pastors. The weekly exhortation from the pulpit alone will never afford the congregation the opportunities necessary to grow in grace and be strengthened in faith. Therefore, Daily Bread, the Bible reading plan of Robert Murray M'Cheyne, was made available to the congregation.As God was saving souls by His grace, it was necessary for us to ensure that those Christ was saving knew what it was that we believed with regard to God's Word. Editing Charles Spurgeon's A Puritan Catechism in plain language for our beloved Yup'ik people was the next step.Yet, as every believer matures at differing rates, and that, by God's grace, it was necessary to identify those whom God had raised, or those who He was raising, within that local congregation. These leaders should certainly have knowledge of orthodox Christianity that surpasses a mere familiarity of the Bible and essential salvation truth. Therefore, the Second London Baptist Confession of 1689 was edited in plain language for our congregation.Circumstances, however, caused my family and me to have to leave our beloved Yup'ik people earlier than we had expected and we were not able to compile all that we were working on into a singular devotional volume... until now. Now, not only do we have A Puritan Family Devotional containing the 1689 London Baptist Confession, but we also have A Pilgrim Family Devotional containing the 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession. The Philadelphia Confession is exactly like the 2nd London Confession except that the Philadelphia Confession has two additions, the "Singing of Psalms in Worship" and the "Laying on of Hands."A Pilgrim Family Devotional is now available using scripture translations from five English versions: KJV, ESV, NASB, and NKJV. These elements, in the catechism, Bible reading plan, and confession of faith, combined with psalms and hymns makes this an excellent volume for use in spiritual growth.The little paperback is not flashy. It contains nothing groundbreaking; nothing new under the sun. Nevertheless, it contains a great deal of devotional encouragement in a size that's easy to carry along with your personal Bible.Check out Christ and Him Crucified, available right here on Amazon.com.

Learn about removing the ads from this memorial...Birth: Jan. 12,  1963, USADeath: Mar. 8,  1995New Mexico, USAJon King (12 January 1963 Jacksonville, Florida - 8 March 1995 Santa Fe, New Mexico) was an American pornographic actor (porn star) who appeared in gay pornographic movies.Born John Nelson Gaines, he died of complications of AIDS at the age of 32.He was one of the most popular gay adult film stars of the 1980s. When asked in interviews, Jon rarely discussed his life in Florida in much detail, except that it involved quite a bit of "getting into trouble". He had been interested in pornography since finding a Playboy magazine his father owned when he was twelve years old. At some point in his teens, he had read about Jack Deveau, owner of Hand In Hand Films, and sent the producer some dark and fuzzy pictures of himself. Deveau politely turned him down.Deciding that he was "going places and doing things he'd never done before", John Gaines and his then-lover went to Los Angeles while on summer vacation in 1980, with plans to go back to school in Florida after he had finished having fun. This changed when his lover got a job and the two young men decided to stay. Eventually John picked up a guy cruising who was a model who had an appointment later that day with a photographer. John tagged along to the interview, and was soon on his way as an adult film performer. His start in adult films came with the 1981 film Brothers Should Do It, where he was billed as Jon King, the younger brother of J.W. King. Though the two strongly resembled each other, they were not related. He next appeared in Biker's Liberty, with Kristen Bjorn, Printer's Devils, and These Bases are Loaded, again with J.W. King. Later, he would complain that the man who helped him get started in the industry was a "psycho" who screwed him over for money. In 1982, just as he was at the seeming peak of his popularity, he stole and wrecked a car, and for this spent eleven months in prison. Jon was later reluctant to discuss his time in prison to interviewers, only saying that "it wasn't fun", particularly since his twentieth birthday was spent behind bars.Making a comeback in 1983, Jon King continued to appear in films and videos throughout the 1980s. Among these were Big Summer Surprise; The Biggest One I Ever Saw (with Lee Ryder and Rick Donovan), Hot Off The Press, Hotel Hell, Inevitable Love, Perfect Summer, Screen Play (again with Lee Ryder), Studhunter, Trick Time (with Tim Kramer), Tyger Tales, Wild Country, and Wild Oats. One of his most memorable scenes was in a hot tub with veteran adult star Kip Nollin 1984's Kip Noll - Superstar.Around 1989, Jon retired from the business and moved to Atlanta, where he attended culinary school. Apparently his dreams of becoming a chef did not work out. He made a second comeback in the early 1990s, appearing in Fade In, Fade Out, Wild Country, and the sequel These Bases are Loaded 2. His last video, Pumping Iron, came out in 1995. Jon King had been HIV positive for a number of years, and soon after completing Pumping Iron, he became extremely ill with AIDS. He moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to live with a friend who looked after his needs. It was here that Jon King died from AIDS complications on 8 March 1995. He was cremated and his ashes mixed and scattered with those of his beloved dog, who had died some years earlier.Jon King's tight, boyishly muscular body, combined with his thick black hair, deep dark eyes, and a youthful innocence and vulnerability made him very popular with most everyone who saw him. He was often described as a gentle, loving person, who sadly spent his whole life searching for a lasting happiness which he never found. When asked about his popularity, John Gaines commented that being recognized and approached in public as Jon King actually made him uncomfortable, and that he had even quit going to gay bars for that reason. "It's not that I don't appreciate it, " he once said of the admiration he received, "I just want to be myself."====================================  Burial:Cremated, Ashes scattered at sea.Specifically: He was cremated and his ashes mixed and scattered with those of his beloved dog, who had died some years earlier. Created by: Pat McArronRecord added: Nov 28, 2012

Continental uses its proprietary Black Chili compound for the Race King, which not only improves grip, but also makes the tire stronger and lighter. Compared to Continental's earlier-generation tire compound, Black Chili tires provide around 20% less rolling-resistance and 30% more grip, all while managing to improve tread life by 5%. The Race King’s low-profile tread pattern delivers excellent power transfer and superb handling. To accomplish this, Continental uses a rolled shoulder profile, transitional knobs, and a diamond-head arrow center tread pattern. Along the outer edge, the pattern uses a ramped leading edge and a block tread. The blocks enhance traction while the ramps ensure a quick rolling tire. The Race King is also built with Continental’s ProTection technology, which provides wall-to-wall protection against punctures.

The downside is that the sidewalls get chewed up after a few rides and look like hell, but these tires have been bombproof for me. I have used them in every condition, wet, dry, rocky, sandy, hardback, etc. They do pretty good in all conditions. I always come back to this tire when everything else fails. They are not going to hook up as good as something like the RaRa, but they hold there own and feel faster to me. Regardless, they are definitely more robust even than the SS RaRa and cheaper. For the price, they can't be beat.  Definitely recommend themChris L.CommentPost a CommentPost CommentWas this helpful?0Flag inappropriatereview by Thomas H. on September 4, 2016Great XC tiresThese tire worked flawlessly and got me through my first Leadville 100. Ran them tubeless with 29psi rear and 27psi front. Had stable predictable handling, good traction and great (low) rolling resistance. Most importantly no flats! And Leadville although not technical has some high speed very rocky sections. These replaced a set of Ardent race 2.2's and these seemed to have quite a bit less rolling resistance. I would definitely highly recommend these for fast XC style riding.Thomas H.CommentPost a CommentPost CommentWas this helpful?0Flag inappropriatereview by Randy W. on July 20, 2016"Bomb-proof performance"--not so much.Familiarity: I've used it once or twice and have initial impressionsThese tires are described in part,  "Even better, this also creates an enhanced level of puncture protection (hence the name)."  No way.  While the sidewalls seem beefier, my rear tire blew one out in LESS THAN 15 miles.  I live in the desert and ride on rocky, prickly trails.  But the only trail this tire saw was a 6' wide little-more-than-gravel road. Not only did the tire puncture, it split enough to spew RevoSealant all over the trail and cannot be salvaged.  I'm hoping I just happened to get a defective tire.  To cap off the bad taste in my mouth, after emailing my complaint to Competitive Cyclist, I got exactly nothing in return.  No response.  Crickets.  Not even, "sorry, but these things happen".Randy W.CommentPost a CommentPost CommentWas this helpful?0Flag inappropriatereview by Joe Draper on December 16, 2015Awesome XC tireThe Race King is the way to go for hardpack XC courses. Moving to a Race King made my bike feel like a road bike on the smooth stuff. Durability is solid as well. Defiantly recommend! Joe DraperCommentPost a CommentPost CommentWas this helpful?0Flag inappropriatereview by Henry Coppolillo on September 6, 2014Great all around XC tiresFamiliarity: I've put it through the wringerThis is one of the best all around XC tires out there. I ran mine tubeless at 25 psi for training and as low as 21 for races. The ProTection technology makes for a super solid tubeless set up, and these tires have excellent flat protection especially when compared to some ultra-thin XC tires. It's a fast-rolling tread that also holds amazing grip on rocks and in corners. I have yet to run them in really wet or muddy conditions. An ideal XC quiver for one season would be 2-3 sets of these and a pair of X-Kings for the mud.
