Summary
Performance
Overview


 





Investment Objective
The  Fund’s investment objective is to provide income, quality and liquidity consistent with the preservation of capital.
 


an anchor for asset allocation
Garcia Hamilton &  Associates, LP, based in Houston, Texas, is an investment management company that  offers high-quality, fixed-income strategies for institutional investors. Founded  in 1988, the firm’s diversified client base includes public funds, jointly  trusteed plans, endowments and corporations. 
Firm  inception: 1988
Portfolio  Managers:

Gilbert  Andrew Garcia, CFA, Managing Partner and Portfolio Manager, industry since 1985
Nancy  Rodriguez, Portfolio Manager, 
    industry since 1987

top-down, active 
  portfolio management
The Fund is actively managed against the Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index and it generally 
maintains a duration range of +/- 10% of that benchmark’s duration. However, the Fund has the 
flexibility to reduce duration for defensive purposes during extreme rising interest-rate environments. 
With a maximum duration of seven years, the Fund’s goal is to outperform the benchmark, net of 
fees, over a full market cycle using a high-quality strategy with less risk, lower volatility and low 
turnover.

The use of fixed-income securities entails  interest rate and credit risks. Credit risk is the risk that the issuer of a bond will  fail to make timely payment of interest or principal; and the decline in an  issuer’s credit rating can cause the price of its bonds to go down. Please see  the prospectus for a complete discussion of the Fund’s risks. There can be no  assurances that the investment objectives of this Fund will be met.
For a prospectus containing more information, including expenses, click here. Read it carefully before you invest or send money. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
