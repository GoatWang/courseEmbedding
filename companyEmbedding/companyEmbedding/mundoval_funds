Our Philosophy


Our Management Team



We believe patience is the most important skill an investor can have along with time, not timing.
Mundoval Capital Management, Inc. is an independent and 100% employee owned registered investment advisory firm founded in 2002. The firm provides its services to individual and institutional investors via separately managed accounts and a mutual fund.
The name Mundoval is derived from the Spanish words mundo and valor, which mean world and value. More than one-half of the world’s stock market capitalization is located outside of the United States and international stock markets have historically performed independently of the United States and one another over time. Investing globally provides a greater number of opportunities to select from and the potential to reduce risk and enhance rates of return through the ownership of businesses throughout the world.
Mundoval Capital Management, Inc. adheres to a value oriented investment philosophy by investing in businesses throughout the world that are believed to be selling at less than our estimate of their worth or intrinsic value. We believe that buying businesses at a discount may provide for a “margin of safety” against the risk of further price declines and loss of principal. First and foremost, we are business owners not speculators. We believe that concentration allows us to focus the portfolio on our best ideas and has a more meaningful impact on our results once the market recognizes intrinsic business value.
Thank you for your interest in and continued support of Mundoval Capital Management, Inc.
Sincerely yours,
Arthur Q. Johnson, CFA
President & Chief Investment Officer

Investment Services Wealth Management Proxy Voting San Diego La Jolla

Proxy Voting


PROXY VOTING POLICIES – The Board of Trustees of the Trust has delegated responsibility for decisions regarding proxy voting for securities held by the Fund to the Fund’s Adviser, Mundoval Capital Management. Mundoval Capital Management  will vote such proxies in accordance with its proxy policies and procedures.
Mundoval Capital Managements

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures (Adopted August 17, 2004)
Pursuant to rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Board of Trustees of Mundoval Capital Managements (the “Trust”) has adopted the following formal, written guidelines for proxy voting by the Trust. The Board of Trustees of the Trust oversees voting policies and decisions for each series of the Trust (the “Funds”).
Each Fund exercises its proxy voting rights with regard to the companies in the Fund’s investment portfolio, with the goals of maximizing the value of the Fund’s investments, promoting accountability of a company’s management and board of directors to its shareholders, aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders, and increasing transparency of a company’s business and operations.
In general, the Board of Trustees of the Trust believes that each Fund’s investment adviser, or sub-adviser, if applicable, which selects the individual companies that are part of the Fund’s portfolio, is the most knowledgeable and best suited to make decisions about proxy votes. Therefore, the Trust defers to and relies on the Funds’ investment advisers or sub-advisers, as appropriate, to make decisions on casting proxy votes.
In some instances, an adviser (or sub-adviser) may be asked to cast a proxy vote that presents a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, and those of the adviser (or sub-adviser) or an affiliated person of the adviser (or sub-adviser). In such a case, the adviser (or sub-adviser) is instructed to abstain from making a voting decision and to forward all necessary proxy voting materials to the Trust to enable the Board of Trustees to make a voting decision. The adviser (or sub-adviser) shall make a written recommendation of the voting decision to the Board of Trustees, which shall include:

An explanation of why it has a conflict of interest;
The reasons for its recommendation; and
An explanation of why the recommendation is consistent with the adviser’s (or sub-adviser’s) proxy voting policies.

The Board of Trustees shall make the proxy voting decision that in its judgment, after reviewing the recommendation of the adviser (or sub-adviser), is most consistent with the adviser’s (or sub-adviser’s) proxy voting policies and in the best interests of Fund shareholders. When the Board of Trustees is required to make a proxy voting decision, only the Trustees without a conflict of interest with regard to the security in question or the matter to voted upon shall be permitted to participate in the decision of how the Fund’s vote will be cast.
A copy of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are available, without charge, upon request, by calling the Trust’s toll-free telephone number at 800-595-2877 and on the Commission’s website at www.sec.gov. The Trust will send a copy of the Trust’s Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures within three business days of receipt of a request, by first-class mail or other means designed to ensure equally prompt delivery.

Mundoval Fund


The Objective of the Fund

The Mundoval Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.


The Principal Investment Strategies and Policies of the Fund

Under normal market conditions the Fund invests primarily in large capitalization common stocks and American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”).
The Fund’s investment strategy focuses on value style investing.
The Fund may hold all or a portion of its assets in cash or cash-equivalents like money market funds, certificates of deposit, short-term debt obligations, and repurchase agreements, either due to pending investments or when investment opportunities are limited. Under these circumstances, the Fund may not participate in stock market advances or declines to the same extent it would had it remained more fully invested in common stocks.
Under the Management Agreement, the Adviser, at its own expense and without reimbursement from the Trust, furnishes office space and all necessary office facilities, equipment and executive personnel necessary for managing the Fund. For its services, the Adviser receives an annual investment management fee of 1.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.

Differentiating Factors

Portfolio Manager invested alongside clients.
Long-term, multi-year investment horizon and low turnover of portfolio holdings.
Consistent application of investment philosophy through market cycles.
Conservative business valuation estimates that prioritize free cash flow generation.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
