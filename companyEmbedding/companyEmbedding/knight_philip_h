Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesOver the past 51 years, Nike cofounder Phil Knight built the company from an idea he had in grad school into one of the biggest companies in the world. 
With a net worth of $21.6 billion, he's also one of the world's richest self-made billionaires. 
Knight might be stepping down as the brand's longtime chairman this year, but his legacy will live on. 
Here's a look back at how Knight's marketing prowess and relentless spirit have driven Nike from a selling a single running shoe to being synonymous with athletic gear.

Phil Knight was born on February 24, 1938. He ran track at the University of Oregon and graduated in 1959 with a degree in journalism. After serving in the Army for a year, he went back to school to earn his MBA from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.

Knight first came up with the idea for Blue Ribbon Sports — the company that later became Nike — during his time at Stanford. He teamed up with his college track coach from Oregon, Bill Bowerman, and they each put in $500 to get the company off the ground.

BRS' strategy was to import Japanese sneakers called Onitsuka Tigers and sell them at higher price points in the US, making a profit on the markup. When Bowerman came up his own design for what became the brand’s signature rubber-waffled sole in 1971, BRS stayed in the Asian market and got the shoes produced there for much cheaper than competitors like Adidas, which operated out of Germany.

When the company officially rebranded as Nike in 1971, several well-known athletes were prominently sporting the shoes, helping double profits annually. Knight and Bowerman’s connections to the running community and focus on producing a high-quality product made Nike the top choice for professional athletes.

The company released the Nike Cortez in 1972 in tandem with the 1972 Olympics in Munich, and Knight ensured the shoes became a top choice of Olympic athletes. The Cortezes came in a variety of colors and debuted Nike’s now ubiquitous “swoosh” logo, making them one of the first sneakers that appealed as much to fashion as to function.

Nike grew quickly throughout the '70s and early '80s, and its revenue jumped from $28.7 million in 1973 to $867 million by 1983.

The company launched the now ubiquitous Air Force 1 model in 1982. It was the first shoe to feature Nike Air, a pocket of air in the heel that provided additional cushioning and support to basketball players. It went on to become one of the most popular sneakers ever, and millions of pairs are still sold every year.

One of Knight’s biggest accomplishments was signing Michael Jordan for an endorsement deal and launching Air Jordan, now one of the most successful sneaker franchises of all time. Nike courted Jordan in 1985, when he was a college basketball all-star on his way to the NBA. He signed a five-year contract for $500,000 a year, an unheard of number at the time.

Air Jordans hit stores for $65 a piece in March 1985, and by May the company had sold $70 million worth of Jordans, earning more than $100 million in revenue from the shoe by the end of the year.

But when Nike’s sales began collapsing in the mid-1980s, Knight knew the company needed to make a major shift in its thinking. It was then that he realized although Nike was marketing to top athletes, the majority of its customers were average citizens, most of whom didn’t even use the shoes for sports.

Knight altered Nike from a product-oriented company to a marketing-oriented one. He began appealing to the everyday customer, eventually turning around sales around. By the end of 1991, it had regained its footing, with sales totaling over $3 billion. “The most important thing we do is market the product,” Knight told the Harvard Business Review in 1992. “Marketing knits the whole organization together. The design elements and functional characteristics of the product itself are just part of the overall marketing process.”

Knight’s marketing genius stemmed from the fact that he didn’t focus on just selling shoes; he always made it about something more. At an industry conference in the mid-1970s, he pointed out an important distinction of his marketing scheme: He proclaimed he wasn’t in the shoe business — rather, he was in the entertainment business.

In the '90s, Nike faced another obstacle: The company had garnered a reputation for using sweatshops and unfair labor practices. Customers began boycotting the brand and protesting outside of its stores, creating a widespread distaste for Nike that lasted nearly a decade.

Sales dropped so low that, by 1998, Nike was forced to start laying off staff. Once again, Knight — who was CEO at the time — stepped in and made drastic changes to save the brand. He owned up to the company’s dismal reputation, raised the minimum wage it paid workers, improved oversight of labor practices, and made sure factories had clean air. Public perception began to turn around, and Nike found itself back on top.

The brand has stayed a powerhouse since. It controls a whopping 62% of athletic-footwear brand share in the US, and its annual revenue tops $30 billion.

Knight himself isn’t doing too poorly either: He’s worth a reported $21.6 billion and owns two private jets, a 2013 Gulfstream G650 and 1999 Gulfstream G-V.

After 51 years devoted to Nike, the 77-year-old Knight announced his plans to step down as chairman last month. He hasn’t given up the reins yet, but Nike said that it hopes to name Knight’s replacement by 2016.

      ■ In 1963 Philip H. Knight began selling track shoes out of the
      trunk of his car. Forty years later he presided over the largest and most
      visible athletic apparel company in the world. From 1964 to 1972 Knight
      and his former track coach, Bill Bowerman, distributed Japanese-made
      running shoes in America and gradually laid the foundation for the Nike
      empire. By the late 1980s, the Nike "swoosh" trademark had
      become ubiquitous, and Knight was well on his way toward managing a
      multibillion-dollar company.
    

      BEGINNINGS OF NIKE
    

      Three events shaped Knight's future as the leader of Nike. The
      first occurred in 1957 when he met Bowerman, his coach on the University
      of Oregon track team. Bowerman was a former Olympian whose passion for
      athletes and innovation would eventually inspire Knight to create a
      business dedicated to those two things. When Knight began his business
      selling shoes to track athletes, Bowerman became his partner. The

          . 
        


      second event occurred when Knight was attending business school at
      Stanford University. In response to an assignment from Professor Frank
      Shallenberger, Knight devised a business and marketing plan for importing
      high-quality running shoes from Japan and selling them in the United
      States at a high profit margin. In a sense the vision of Nike was born in
      that class. The third event occurred in 1963 when Knight traveled to Japan
      and met with executives from the Onitsaka Company, which distributed Tiger
      running shoes. Knight talked himself into a distribution contract with the
      company, and when the executives asked which company he represented,
      Knight blurted out the first thing to come into his head: Blue Ribbon
      Sports. The trip initiated Knight's lifelong fascination with
      Japanese culture and presaged the globalization of Nike.
    

      BLUE RIBBON SPORTS
    

      In 1964 Knight and Bill Bowerman both invested $500 to start Blue Ribbon
      Sports, which would work together with the Onitsaka Company to develop and
      distribute running shoes for the North American market. As the company
      struggled to grow, Knight worked as a certified public accountant and
      taught at Portland State University. Over the next few years BRS retail
      stores opened in Santa Monica, California, and Eugene, Oregon, and the
      company began to assemble employees who would later take on key roles at
      Nike. In 1969 alone Knight sold $1 million worth of Tiger shoes. By the
      end of 1971 contract disagreements with Onitsaka prompted Knight and
      Bowerman to consider starting their own shoe company. Knight paid a former
      Portland State student to develop the swoosh design, and Jeff Johnson, a
      Blue Ribbon Sports employee, literally dreamed up the Nike name. The first
      model of shoe, the Cortez, debuted at the 1972 Olympic trials, and in that
      first year Nike had revenues of more than $3 million.
    

      FOCUSING ON THE ATHLETE
    

      Being an athlete himself, Knight wanted to shape his company around the
      needs of athletes. He also wanted to create products that the
      world's greatest athletes would want to use and be associated with.
      At first Knight reached out to Olympic track athletes, such as the
      long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine, who would influence other runners
      to try the shoes. In 1978 Nike approached the tennis star John McEnroe and
      signed him to an endorsement deal. This choice of spokesperson reflected
      Knight's vision that the great athlete was the ultimate free
      spirit. By 1980 Nike had captured one-half of the athletic shoe market and
      carried out its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
      The escalating wealth of the company allowed Nike to sign additional
      topflight athletes to endorsement contracts, including highly lucrative
      relationships with Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.
    

      WEATHERING CRITICISM
    

      As Nike's market share grew throughout the 1980s and 1990s, so did
      public criticism of the company's business strategies. Much of this
      criticism focused directly on Knight, whose enigmatic personality and
      casual appearance became a focus of the news media. At the 1992 Olympic
      games Michael Jordan and other National Basketball Association players
      with Nike endorsements refused to appear on television with the insignia
      of their official Reebok sweat suits showing. When Knight, in trying to
      defuse the controversy, failed to vigorously support the athletes, his
      relationship with some of them was strained. The greatest controversy
      Knight had to confront in the 1990s was growing criticism of how Nike
      contracted with "sweatshops" in Southeast Asia to produce
      its shoes. Although Knight eventually responded to Nike's critics
      with a program of reforms, he and Nike continued to be a prime focus of
      many antiglobalization groups.
    

      CONTINUAL EXPANSION
    

      Knight was vigilant to keep Nike at the top of the industry. In the late
      1980s, when Reebok briefly supplanted Nike as the most profitable athletic
      shoe company, Knight streamlined the Nike campus in Beaverton, Oregon, and
      gave it a corporate atmosphere while maintaining the image of a company
      run by casually rebellious athletes. In the 1990s, despite criticism,
      Knight involved the company in environmental and community service
      activities. At the same time Nike branched out into hockey, golf, and
      soccer apparel, opened huge Niketown stores in shopping malls, and
      continued its dominance in the area of track-and-field apparel. As the
      result of this aggressive expansion, Nike had more than $10 billion in
      yearly sales before 1999.
    

      Knight was said to be not fond of advertising. Yet slogans such as
      "Just do it" and images such as that of Michael Jordan
      soaring through the air cemented Nike's place in the industry. Nike
      advertisements portrayed great athletes as objects worthy of worship but
      also implied that everyone has greatness within themselves. The global
      power of these messages was such that in 2003 Nike's international
      sales exceeded its U.S. revenues for the first time in the
      company's history.

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]




Knight's personal hangar at Hillsboro Airport.


In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]




Knight's personal hangar at Hillsboro Airport.


In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]




Knight's personal hangar at Hillsboro Airport.


In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]

In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]




Knight's personal hangar at Hillsboro Airport.


In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]

In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]




Knight's personal hangar at Hillsboro Airport.


In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]

In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]




Knight's Green, a lawn named after Knight at Marylhurst University in Marylhurst, Oregon.


On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

He is the co-founder and chairman of Nike. He was born on February 24, 1938. In 2013, Forbes gave Knight the 56Th richest person in the world and the 24Th richest in America. By estimation he is worth approximately 16.3 billion dollars. Road to SuccessNIKE as a Businesssportsillistrated.comKnight first came up with the blueprint for Nike while working on his Masters degree at Stanford University. He was assigned to write a term paper on starting a small business and as a former track star he chose running. Shortly after graduating in 1962, Knight traveled to Japan and told a knock off Adidas that it would be a smart choice to "invest" in his company that didn't even exist yet. The company sent him some samples which he then sent to his previous track coach. They then became partners. Bowerman and Knight became official business men and established Blue Mountain Sports. They then purchased 200 pair of shoes and began selling them out of a truck at track meets in the Pacific Northwest. http://thecleanslate704.comhttp://www.zimbio.comWork Cited"Phil Knight." Forbes.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Philip H. Knight Philip H. Knight University of OregonWhile Knight was at the University of Oregon,  he met and trained as a middle-distance runner with the legendary track coach Bill Bowerman. Knights nickname was Buck, and although he was known more for his enthusiasm than his natural running talent, he struck up an immediate friendship with Bowerman.  Bowerman was determined to wear the best shoes possible, Knight became his guinea pig when it came to trying out new shoes. Bowerman was not satisfied with any shoes they tried and started designing his own shoes. n 1959, Knight graduated from Oregon with a degree in journalism. He had been an indifferent student and, still not knowing what to do with his life, Knight enlisted in the army. After completing a year of service, Knight decided to enroll in the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. Stanford Finally, at Stanford, Knight actually began to enjoy school and learning about something other than sports. His favorite class soon became a business class. The teacher  had gave his students an assignment in which they had to invent a new business, describe its purpose, and create a marketing plan. Knights paper was called, Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras? In it, Knight developed a blueprint for superior athletic shoes, which could be produced cheaply in Japan. Despite having found his true calling, Knight ended up doing what his fathers wanted and took up a real job with a Portland-based accounting firm after graduating from Stanford. He didn't last long there, later on he took his business plan to Japan. Japan In 1962, Knight flew to Japan to visit Onitsuka Tiger Co., manufacturer of an Adidas knockoff sold in Japan. Introducing himself as the head of Blue Ribbon Sports, a company which did not exist yet.  They ended up sending him samples which caused him to have to borrow money from his father. He sent a few pairs to his former University of Oregon coach, Bill Bowerman, who quickly became his partner. Knight began selling from his car at high school track meets throughout the Pacific Northwest.By the early 1970s, Blue Ribbon  went solo and start designing its own shoes. In 1972, Blue Ribbon launched its Nike line, named after the Greek goddess of victory. Emblazoned with a "swoosh" logo Knight paid a Portland State art student $35 to design, the shoes featured a unique "waffle sole"-created by Bowerman-that offered better traction with less weight.Conclusion By 1986, total sales hit $1 billion, and Nike surpassed Adidas to become the No. 1 shoe manufacturer worldwide. Between 1986 and 1987, Nike sales dropped 18 percent. Knight was forced to face the fact that while Nike technology appealed to sports professionals, other consumers might rank appearance over function. In response, Nike came up with Nike Air-a multipurpose shoe with an air cushion in the sole. But as Nike has grown into a huge multinational enterprise, it has become a magnet for controversy. Philip Knight, now in his late 50s, has come to be viewed as one of the master marketers of the age. ChildhoodPhilip was born on February 24, 1938, in Portland, Oregon.  Philip H. Knight was the son of Lota Hatfield Knight and William W. Knight. He discovered his love for running at a young age, and was a key member of the track team at Cleveland High School. From there, Knight moved on to the University of Oregon, where he found himself competing with Olympic distance runners. OlympicsKnight decided to get top athletes to endorse his shoes, and then let his sales force sell the product. That summer, the Olympic track and field trials were held in Eugene, Oregon, with none other than Bill Bowerman as coach of the American Olympic team. Knight put Nikes on the feet of several top finishers. When they made national television, so did the shoes they were wearing. One of the most visible runners to wear Nikes was American record-holder Steve Prefontaine. Full transcriptMore presentations by

Early life[edit]
Knight was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of lawyer turned newspaper publisher Bill Knight, and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.[5][6] Knight grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper, the Oregon Journal, believing that his son should find work on his own, Phil went to the rival, The Oregonian, where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores every morning and running home the full seven miles."[7]
Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon (UO) in Eugene, where he is a graduate brother of Phi Gamma Delta ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the Oregon Daily Emerald[8] and earned a journalism degree in 1959.[5]
As a middle-distance runner at UO, his personal best was 1 mile (1.6 km) in 4 minutes, 10 seconds,[9] and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958 and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.[10]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before the Blue Ribbon Sports business that would later become Nike flourished, Knight was a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), firstly with Price Waterhouse, and then Coopers & Lybrand. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University (PSU).[11]
Nike Inc.[edit]
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve.[5] After the year of active duty, he enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business.[5] In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports — he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a Stanford Magazine article:[5] "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.'" In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan. His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.[5]
Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed was he with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.[12]
The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at UO, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company name that would later be transformed into Nike.[13]
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.[12]
Jeff Johnson, employee number one of Nike, suggested calling the firm "Nike," named after the Greek winged goddess of victory. Nike's "swoosh" logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world, was commissioned for a mere US$35 from Carolyn Davidson in 1971.[14] According to Nike's website, Knight said at the time: "I don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah television program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave Davidson "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.[15]
Vinton Studios/Laika[edit]
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, the animation company Will Vinton Studios experienced very rapid growth and Vinton needed to court external investors—Knight was one of the wealthy businessmen that he approached. Knight subsequently assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998 and facilitated the employment of his son Travis, who had graduated from PSU following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career, as an animator.[16]
Following a period of severe mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company's board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board, who had proven himself as an adept animator since joining the company, and after Vinton stepped down from the board—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. Knight invested US$180 million into Laika following Vinton's departure and the studio released its first feature film, Coraline (in stop motion), in 2009. Coraline was a financial success and Travis Knight was promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and President in the same year.[16][17]
Death of Matthew Knight[edit]
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with colleagues in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died immediately from a heart attack 65 feet (20 m) underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew Knight's body to the U.S. and Travis explained in 2007, "It brought the family closer. You realize all this can go away in a minute."[17] Laika Studio's 2005 short film Moongirl was dedicated to Matthew's memory.
Knight resigned as the CEO of Nike on November 18, 2004, several months after his son Matthew's funeral,[17] but retained the position of chairman of the board.[18][19] Knight's replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.[20]
In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon, was named in his honor.[21]
Post-Nike CEO role[edit]
During the 2009-2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.[22]
According to a February 10, 2012 filing by attorney John F. Coburn III, on behalf of Knight, Knight owned 67,097,005 shares of Class A Common Stock and 7,740 shares of Class B Common Stock in the Nike corporation.[23]
In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company's chairman, with president/CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. However, a date had not been set for his departure, and he said he plans to remain involved in the company.[24][25] Knight's retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016.[26][27]
Memoir[edit]
In late 2015, Phil Knight announced that he was writing a book about his early days with the Nike brand. The memoir is titled Shoe Dog and was released on April 26, 2016.[28] It is about the difficult times he went through to build the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation. [29]
Philanthropy[edit]
Stanford University[edit]
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to an American business school. The campus was named "The Knight Management Center," in honor of Knight's philanthropic service to the school.[30]
In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program. The program will admit up to 100 students with demonstrated leadership and civic commitment each year and is inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship.[31] Over 80% of the endowment will cover living expenses and education at one of the seven graduate schools at Stanford; the graduates are charged to tackle global challenges such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 50 will be admitted in fall 2018.[32] The scholars' academic experience will focus on both subject-specific knowledge and leadership development so that they can be prepared to address global challenges.[33]
University of Oregon[edit]
Knight has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University of Oregon's academic side. Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus.[34] In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex.[35] This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.[36]
Oregon Ducks[edit]
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny said: "This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena." At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.[37]
The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team's facility, Matthew Knight Arena, was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn't pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million "Athletic Legacy Fund." The fund supports the athletic department.[38] Named after Knight's deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and its cost of over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.[38]
Knight was responsible for financing the UO's US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight's personal locker in the team's locker room displays the title "Uncle Phil", and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the player's lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.[39][40][41]
In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction will begin in January 2016 and end in September 2016.[42] The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly. [43]
In October 2016, Knight and his wife invested $500 million to build a new campus dedicated to science, called the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Three new buildings will be constructed and will provide 750 family-wage jobs once it is completed and fully operational. [44][45]
Controversy[edit]
However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at UO have also led to controversy.[46] In April 2000, student body leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO's administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.[47][48]
University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC, and Knight's reaction was to withdraw a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.[49][50] In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.[51] In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight's assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation[52][53] and in October 2000, according to the Eugene Weekly, Frohnmayer stated:

... he would refuse to pay dues to the WRC based on a legal opinion from UO General Counsel Melinda Grier arguing that to do so would be illegal and open the university to liability. Grier claimed the WRC had not yet incorporated, had not yet filed as a non-profit, and served no public purpose justifying a dues payment.[48]

On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA.[54] Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.[55]
Also controversial was Knight's success in lobbying for his wealthy friend, and a former insurance salesman, Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university.[56] Kilkenny had neither a college degree, nor any prior experience in athletics administration—he attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego, U.S.-based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.[57]
Other projects[edit]

In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health & Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the "OHSU Knight Cancer Institute."[58]
In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.[59]

On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle.[60][61] According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.[62] In the fall of 2014, it was reported in the media that Knight would donate up to $1 billion to UO's endowment fund. However, these rumors did not materialize.[63]
On September 27, 2013, Knight surprised the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute's biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years.[64] On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.[65]
Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus "Knight's Green" in the family's honor.[66]
In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had gifted $112 million in Nike stock to charity.[67]
Accolades[edit]
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.[68] At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.[69]
On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.[70]
For his "contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership", Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.[71][72]
Personal life[edit]
Knight met his wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and the pair were married on September 13, 1968.[73] They own a home in La Quinta, California.[74]

10 Quotes for Small Business from Nike Founder Phil Knight

Phil Knight discovered he was an entrepreneur while sitting in a small business class at Stanford School of Business. “That class was an ‘aha!’ moment,” he said. “[the professor] defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur—and I realized he was talking to me. I remember saying to myself: This is really what I would like to do.”
With $600 (matched by another $600 from his partner Bill Bowerman), Phil Knight founded the company that would become the sports powerhouse Nike. For those born after 1980, it simply isn’t possible to remember a time when Nike wasn’t synonymous with sports. But in its early years, Nike had difficulty making payroll and selling enough shoes to pay for the next shipment of inventory. Sounds like a lot of other small businesses we’ve heard of.
Despite its humble beginnings (Knight’s first sales were made at track meets, from the back of his Plymouth station wagon) and thanks to great product, well-timed celebrity endorsements, and a lot of luck, Nike is now one of the most successful companies of the past 30 years. Here are a few things Phil Knight has said about his rise from small business owner to CEO of the world’s premier sporting goods company:
“At first, we couldn’t be establishment, because we didn’t have any money. We were guerrilla marketers, and we still are, a little bit. But, as we became No. 1 in our industry, we’ve had to modify our culture and become a bit more planned.”
“A brand is something that has a clear-cut identity among consumers, which a company creates by sending out a clear, consistent message over a period of years until it achieves a critical mass of marketing.”
“Ultimately, we wanted Nike to be the world’s best sports and fitness company. Once you say that, you have a focus. You don’t end up making wing tips or sponsoring the next Rolling Stones world tour.”
“Play by the rules, but be ferocious.”
“If you want to spend time saying this is cool, you’re going to get your ass kicked.”
“I do not follow conventional wisdom.”
“It doesn’t matter how many people you offend, as long as you’re getting your message to your consumers. I say to those people who do not want to offend anybody: You are going to have a very, very difficult time having meaningful advertising.”
“We understand the most important thing we do is market the product…”
“Nike is a marketing-oriented company, and the product is our most important marketing tool.”
“We used to think that everything started in the lab. Now we realize that everything spins off the consumer.”
—Phil Knight, Founder of Nike

[…] As Knight said, “Nike is a marketing-oriented company…” and “We understand the most important thing we do is market the product.”  Manufacturing is just the dirty work best done by people willing to do such dirty work on the cheap.  […]
