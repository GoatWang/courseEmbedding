Annuities


We are well-schooled in retirement planning.













An annuity is a contract between an investor and a life insurance company that allows the investor to put away money for retirement.  Annuities can provide a lump sum payment or periodic payments at specified intervals, usually after retirement.  Annuities can be fixed, variable or indexed depending on the level of risk an investor is willing to take.  And, they can be qualified or non-qualified for certain tax benefits.   Annuities may be issued in connection with qualified retirement plans or arrangements (qualified annuities) or issued as a non-qualified annuity.  All annuities receive tax deferral on the earnings.  Qualified annuities receive additional tax advantages as a result of the qualified plan or arrangement for which they are purchased.  Purchasing an annuity as an investment vehicle for a qualified retirement plan or arrangement does not provide any additional tax advantage beyond that already available through the qualified plan or arrangement. Qualified Annuities Include:
  403(b)   457(b)   Traditional IRA   Roth IRA    Annuities should be considered long-term investments.  If you take your money out early, you could be subject to contract charges, income taxes and an additional 10-percent tax. In addition, withdrawals made prior to age 59½ on tax-qualified contracts may be restricted by the IRS or your employer’s plan. You should consult with your tax advisor regarding any tax-favored product.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS





	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, utilizing a
	shelf registration process. By using a shelf prospectus, we may sell, at any time and from time to time in one or more offerings, any combination of the securities described in this prospectus. Together, these offerings may total up to
	$300,000,000.




	We are not making an offer of these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer is not permitted. You should
	not assume that the information in this prospectus or a prospectus supplement is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front of the document.




	This prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement containing specific information about the
	terms of that offering. That prospectus supplement may include a discussion of any risk factors or other special considerations applicable to those securities. The prospectus supplement also may add, update or change information in this prospectus.
	If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. You should read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement together with
	the additional information described under the heading Where You Can Find More Information.




	The registration
	statement containing this prospectus, including the exhibits to the registration statement, provides additional information about us and the securities offered under this prospectus. The exhibits to the registration statement contain the full text
	of certain contracts and other important documents we have summarized in this prospectus. You should review the full text of these documents because these summaries may not contain all the information that you may find important in deciding whether
	to purchase the securities we offer. The registration statement, including the exhibits, can be read at the SECs Web site or at the SECs offices mentioned under the heading Where You Can Find More Information.




	Unless we have indicated otherwise, references in this prospectus to Horace Mann, we, us and
	our or similar terms are to Horace Mann Educators Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.










	WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION





	We file
	annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy these materials at the SEC reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for
	further information on their public reference room. Our SEC filings are also available to the public at the SECs Web site (http://www.sec.gov).




	The SECs Web site contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding issuers, like Horace Mann, that file electronically with the SEC. You may find Horace Manns reports, proxy
	statements and other information at the SEC Web site. In addition, you can obtain reports and proxy statements and other information about Horace Mann at the offices of the New York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005.

	SPECIAL NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION





	This prospectus, including documents we incorporate by reference in this prospectus, contains a number of forward-looking statements
	within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding our financial condition, results of operations, earnings outlook, business and prospects. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as

	These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our

	THE COMPANY





	Horace Mann is an insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware. Through our subsidiaries, we market and underwrite personal lines
	of property and casualty (primarily private passenger automobile and homeowners) insurance, retirement annuities (primarily tax-qualified products) and life insurance in the United States. Our principal insurance subsidiaries are Horace Mann Life
	Insurance Company, Horace Mann Insurance Company, Horace Mann Property & Casualty Insurance Company and Teachers Insurance Company, each of which is an Illinois corporation, and Horace Mann Lloyds, an insurance company domiciled in Texas.




	We market our products primarily to K-12 teachers, administrators and other employees of public schools and their families.
	Our nearly one million customers typically have moderate annual incomes, with many belonging to two-income households. Their financial planning tends to focus on retirement, security, savings and primary insurance needs. We believe that Horace Mann
	is the largest national multiline insurance company focused on the nations educators as its primary market.




	We market
	and service our products primarily through a dedicated sales force of full-time agents trained to sell multiline products. Our agents sell our products and limited additional third-party vendor products authorized by us. Some of these agents are
	former educators or individuals with close ties to the educational community who utilize their contacts within, and knowledge of, the target market. Compensation for agents includes an incentive element based upon the profitability of the business
	they write. This dedicated agent sales force is supplemented by an independent agent distribution channel for our annuity products.




	Our principal executive offices are located at 1 Horace Mann Plaza, Springfield, Illinois 62715-0001 (telephone number: (217) 789-2500). Our Web site address is

	http://www.horacemann.com

	. Our Web site address is included in this prospectus as an inactive textual reference only.

	USE OF PROCEEDS





	Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying this prospectus, the net proceeds from the sale of the securities to
	which this prospectus relates will be used for general corporate purposes. General corporate purposes may include repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions, repurchases of outstanding shares of common stock, additions to working capital, capital

	2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. For purposes of computing the ratio of consolidated earnings to fixed charges, earnings consists of income (loss) before income taxes

	DESCRIPTION OF THE DEBT SECURITIES





	The following is a general description of the debt securities that we may offer from time to time. The particular terms of the debt
	securities offered by any prospectus supplement and the extent, if any, to which the general provisions described below may apply to those securities, will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. We may also sell hybrid securities that
	combine certain features of debt securities and other securities described in this prospectus. As you read this section, please remember that the specific terms of a debt security as described in the applicable prospectus supplement will supplement
	and may modify or replace the general terms described in this section. If there are any differences between the applicable prospectus supplement and this prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement will control. As a result, the statements we
	make in this section may not apply to the debt security you purchase.




	As used in this Description of the Debt
	Securities, the Company refers to Horace Mann Educators Corporation and does not, unless the context otherwise indicates, include our subsidiaries.




	Capitalized terms used but not defined in this section have the respective meanings set forth in the applicable indenture.





	General





	The debt securities that we offer will be either senior debt
	securities or subordinated debt securities. We will issue senior debt securities under an indenture, which we refer to as the senior indenture, to be entered into between us and the trustee named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We will
	issue subordinated debt securities under a different indenture, which we refer to as the subordinated indenture, to be entered into between us and the trustee named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We refer to both the senior indenture and
	the subordinated indenture as the indentures, and to each of the trustees under the indentures as a trustee. In addition, the indentures may be supplemented or amended as necessary to set forth the terms of the debt securities issued under the
	indentures. You should read the indentures, including any amendments or supplements, carefully to fully understand the terms of the debt securities. The forms of the indentures have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this
	prospectus is a part. The indentures are subject to, and are governed by, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.




	The
	senior debt securities will be unsubordinated obligations of the Company. They will rank equally with each other and all of our other unsubordinated debt, unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. The subordinated debt
	securities will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of our senior debt. See Subordination of Subordinated Debt Securities. The subordinated debt securities will rank equally with each other, unless otherwise
	indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. We will indicate in each applicable prospectus supplement, as of the most recent practicable date, the aggregate amount of our outstanding debt that would rank senior to the subordinated debt
	securities.




	Unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to any debt securities, the debt securities will
	not constitute obligations of our subsidiaries. Creditors of our subsidiaries are entitled to a claim on the assets of those subsidiaries. Consequently, in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary, creditors of the subsidiary
	are likely to be paid in full before any distribution is made to the Company and holders of debt securities, except to the extent that the Company is itself recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary, in which case the Companys claims would
	still be subordinate to any security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any debt of such subsidiary senior to that held by the Company.




	The indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that can be issued thereunder and provide that debt securities of any series may be issued thereunder up to the aggregate principal amount that we
	may authorize from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in any prospectus supplement, the indentures do not limit the amount of other indebtedness or securities that we may issue. We may issue debt securities of the same series at more than one
	time and, unless prohibited by the terms of the series, we may reopen a series for issuances of additional debt securities, without the consent of the holders of the outstanding debt securities of that series. All debt securities issued as a series,
	including those issued pursuant to any reopening of a series will vote together as a single class unless otherwise described in the prospectus supplement for such series.

	Principal when used herein includes any premium on any series of the
	debt securities.




	Unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to any debt securities, principal and
	interest, if any, will be payable, and transfers of the debt securities may be registered, at the office or offices or agency we maintain for such purposes, provided that payment of interest on the debt securities will be paid at such place by check
	mailed to the persons entitled thereto at the addresses of such persons appearing on the security register. Interest on the debt securities will be payable on any interest payment date to the persons in whose names the debt securities are registered
	at the close of business on the record date for such interest payment.




	The debt securities may be represented in whole or in
	part by one or more global notes registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee and, if so represented, interests in such global note will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by the designated
	depositary and its participants.




	Unless otherwise provided in the prospectus supplement relating to any debt securities, the
	debt securities may be exchanged for an equal aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the same series and date of maturity in such authorized denominations as may be requested upon surrender of the debt securities at an agency of the
	Company maintained for such purpose and upon fulfillment of all other requirements of such agent. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the debt securities, but we may require payment of an amount sufficient
	to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.




	The indentures require the annual filing by
	the Company with the trustee of a certificate as to compliance with certain covenants contained in the indentures.




	We will
	comply with Section 14(e) under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable, and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act that may then be applicable, in connection with any obligation to purchase debt securities at the option of the
	holders thereof. Any such obligation applicable to a series of debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating thereto.




	Unless otherwise described in a prospectus supplement relating to any debt securities, there are no covenants or provisions contained in the indentures that may afford the holders of debt securities
	protection in the event that we enter into a highly leveraged transaction.




	The statements made hereunder relating to the
	indentures and the debt securities are summaries of certain provisions thereof and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all provisions of the indentures and the debt securities and the descriptions thereof, if different, in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.





	Events of Default





	Except as otherwise set forth in any prospectus supplement relating to any debt securities, an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of any series is defined in the indentures as:




	(1) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the debt securities of such series as
	and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days;




	(2)
	default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of any of the debt securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable either at maturity, upon any redemption or repurchase, by declaration or otherwise;




	(3) default in the performance, or breach, of any other covenant or warranty contained in the debt securities of such
	series or set forth in the applicable indenture (other than a covenant or warranty included in the applicable indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of debt securities other than such series) and continuance of such default or breach
	for a period of 90 days after due notice by the trustee or by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding securities of such series; or




	 




	9







	Table of Contents




	(4) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the
	Company.




	Additional Events of Default may be added for the benefit of holders of certain series of debt securities that, if
	added, will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to such debt securities.




	The indentures provide that the
	trustee shall notify the holders of debt securities of each series of any continuing default known to the trustee which has occurred with respect to such series within 90 days after the occurrence thereof. The indentures provide that notwithstanding
	the foregoing, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, or interest, if any, on any of the debt securities of such series, the trustee may withhold such notice if the trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of
	such notice is in the interests of the holders of debt securities of such series.




	Except as otherwise set forth in the
	prospectus supplement relating to any debt securities, the indentures provide that if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganizations of the Company) with respect to any
	series of debt securities shall have occurred and be continuing, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of debt securities of such series then outstanding may declare the principal amount of all debt
	securities of such series and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration to be due and payable immediately, but upon certain conditions such declaration may be annulled. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy,
	insolvency or reorganization, the principal amount of the debt securities and any unpaid interest accrued thereon through the occurrence of such event shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable. Any past defaults and the
	consequences thereof, except a default in the payment of principal of or interest, if any, on debt securities of such series, may be waived by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of such series then outstanding.




	Subject to the provisions of the indentures relating to the duties of the trustee, in case an Event of Default with respect
	to any series of debt securities shall occur and be continuing, the trustee shall not be under any obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by the indentures at the request or direction of any of the holders of such series,
	unless such holders shall have offered to such trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each series affected and then outstanding shall have the right,
	subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee under the applicable indenture or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the
	debt securities of such series; provided that the trustee may refuse to follow any direction which is in conflict with any law or such indenture and subject to certain other limitations.




	No holder of any debt security of any series will have any right under the indentures to institute any proceeding with respect to the
	indentures or for any remedy thereunder, unless such holder shall have previously given the trustee written notice of an Event of Default with respect to debt securities of such series and unless the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
	amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series shall also have made written request, and offered indemnity satisfactory to the trustee to institute the proceeding, and the trustee shall have failed to institute the proceeding within 60
	days after its receipt of such request, and the trustee shall not have received from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series a direction inconsistent with such request. However, the
	right of a holder of any debt security to receive payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on such debt security on or after the due dates expressed in such debt security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or
	after such dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.





	Merger





	Each indenture provides that the Company may consolidate with, sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of its assets to, or merge
	with or into, any other corporation, if:




	(1) either (a) the Company is the continuing corporation or
	(b) the successor corporation is a domestic corporation and expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all the debt securities outstanding under such indenture according to their tenor and the due and
	punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of such indenture to be performed or observed by the Company; and




	 




	10







	Table of Contents




	(2) the Company or such successor corporation, as the case may be, is not,
	immediately after such merger, consolidation, sale, conveyance or lease, in material default in the performance or observance of any such covenant or condition.





	Satisfaction and Discharge of Indentures





	The indenture with respect to any
	series of debt securities (except for certain specified surviving obligations including the Companys obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the debt securities of such series) will be discharged and cancelled upon the satisfaction
	of certain conditions, including the payment of all the debt securities of such series or the deposit with the trustee under such indenture of cash or appropriate government obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for such payment or
	redemption in accordance with the applicable indenture and the terms of the debt securities of such series.





	Modification of the Indentures





	The indentures contain provisions permitting the Company and the trustee thereunder, with the consent of the holders of
	not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of each series at the time outstanding under the applicable indenture affected thereby, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to, or changing in any
	manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the applicable indenture or any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the debt securities of each such series; provided that no such supplemental indenture may:




	(1) extend the final maturity date of any debt security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the
	rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption or repurchase thereof, or impair or affect the right of any holder of debt securities to institute suit for payment thereof or, if the debt
	securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the holders of the debt securities, without the consent of the holder of each debt security so affected;




	(2) reduce the aforesaid percentage of debt securities of such series, the consent of the holders of which is required for
	any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all debt securities of such series so affected; or




	(3) reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity date of any original issue discount security.




	Additional amendments requiring the consent of each holder affected thereby may be specified for the benefit of holders of certain series of debt securities and, if added, will be described in the
	prospectus supplement relating to such debt securities.




	Additionally, in certain circumstances prescribed in the indenture
	governing the relevant series of debt securities, the Company and the trustee may execute supplemental indentures without the consent of the holders of debt securities.





	Defeasance





	The indentures provide, if such provision is made applicable to
	the debt securities of any series, that the Company may elect to terminate, and be deemed to have satisfied, all its obligations with respect to such debt securities (except for the obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such debt
	securities, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities, to maintain an office or agency in respect of the debt securities, to compensate and indemnify the trustee and to punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and
	interest, if any, on all debt securities of such series when due) (defeasance) upon the deposit with the trustee, in trust for such purpose, of funds and/or government obligations which through the payment of principal and interest in
	accordance with their terms will provide funds in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and premium and interest, if any,




	 




	11







	Table of Contents




	on the outstanding debt securities of such series, and any mandatory sinking fund or analogous payments thereon, on the scheduled due dates therefor. Such a trust may be established only if, the
	Company complies with certain conditions, including delivery to the trustee of an opinion of counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the holders of such debt securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for
	federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred.




	The prospectus supplement may further describe these or other provisions, if any, permitting defeasance with respect to the debt
	securities of any series.





	Subordination of Subordinated Debt Securities





	The senior debt securities will constitute part of our Senior Indebtedness (as defined below) and will rank

	pari passu

	with all
	outstanding senior debt. Except as set forth in the related prospectus supplement, the subordinated debt securities will be subordinated, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of our Senior Indebtedness, including the senior debt
	securities, whether outstanding at the date of the subordinated indenture or thereafter incurred, assumed or guaranteed.




	Except as set forth in the related prospectus supplement, Senior Indebtedness means:




	(1) the principal of and premium, if any, and unpaid interest on indebtedness for money borrowed;




	(2) purchase money and similar obligations;




	(3) obligations under capital leases or leases of property or assets made as part of any sale and leaseback transaction;




	(4) guarantees, assumptions or purchase commitments relating to, or other transactions as a result of which
	the Company is responsible for the payment of, such indebtedness of others;




	(5) renewals, extensions and
	refunding of any such indebtedness;




	(6) interest or obligations in respect of any such indebtedness accruing
	after the commencement of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; and




	(7) obligations associated with
	derivative products such as interest rate and currency exchange contracts, foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts, and similar arrangements;




	unless, in each case, the instrument by which the Company incurred, assumed or guaranteed the indebtedness or obligations described in clauses (1) through (7) hereof expressly provides that such
	indebtedness or obligation is not senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt securities.




	Upon any distribution of
	the Companys assets in connection with any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether in a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or receivership proceeding or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors
	or any other marshaling of the Companys assets and liabilities or otherwise, except a distribution in connection with a merger or consolidation or a conveyance or transfer of all or substantially all of the properties of the Company in
	accordance with the subordinated indenture, the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive payment of the full amount due thereon before the holders of any of the subordinated debt securities are entitled to receive any
	payment in respect of the subordinated debt securities. In the event that a payment default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Senior Indebtedness, the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive
	payment of the full amount due thereon before the holders of any of the subordinated debt securities are entitled to receive any payment in respect of the subordinated debt securities. In the event that the principal of the subordinated debt
	securities of any series shall have been declared due and payable pursuant to the subordinated indenture and such declaration shall not have been rescinded and annulled, the holders of all Senior Indebtedness outstanding at the time of such
	declaration shall first be entitled to receive payment of the full amount due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in full, before the holders of any of the subordinated debt securities are entitled to receive any payment in respect
	of the subordinated debt securities.

	Table of Contents




	This subordination will not prevent the occurrence of any event of default with respect to
	the subordinated debt securities. There is no limitation on the issuance of additional Senior Indebtedness in the subordinated indenture.





	Book-Entry, Delivery and Form





	The debt securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a depositary (a Debt Depositary)
	identified in the applicable prospectus supplement. Global securities may be issued in either registered or bearer form and in either temporary or permanent form. Unless otherwise provided in such prospectus supplement, debt securities that are
	represented by a global security will be issued in denominations of $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons.




	We anticipate that any global securities will be deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company (DTC), and that such global securities will be registered in the name of
	Cede & Co., DTCs nominee. We further anticipate that the following provisions will apply to the depository arrangements with respect to any such global securities. Any additional or differing terms of the depository arrangements will
	be described in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of debt securities issued in the form of global securities.




	Beneficial interests in the global securities will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in DTC.
	Investors may elect to hold their interests in the global securities through either DTC (in the United States) or (in Europe) through Clearstream Banking S.A. (Clearstream) or through the Euroclear system (Euroclear) of
	Euroclear S.A./N.V. Investors may hold their interests in the global securities directly if they are participants of such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in these systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold
	interests on behalf of their participants through customers securities accounts in Clearstreams and Euroclears names on the books of their respective U.S. depositaries, which in turn will hold these interests in customers
	securities accounts in the depositaries names on the books of DTC. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in denominations of $1,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Except as set forth below, the global
	securities may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee.




	Debt securities represented by a global security can be exchanged for definitive securities in registered form only if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint a successor depositary within
	90 days after receiving that notice;






	 





	 




	




	 





	at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered or in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other
	applicable statute or regulation and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days after becoming aware that DTC has ceased to be registered as a clearing agency; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	we determine that that global security will be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form and notifies the trustee of its decision.







	A global security that can be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence will be exchanged for
	definitive securities issued in authorized denominations in registered form for the same aggregate amount. The definitive securities will be registered in the names of the owners of the beneficial interests in the global security as directed by DTC.




	 




	13







	Table of Contents




	We will make principal and interest payments on all debt securities represented by a global
	security to the paying agent which in turn will make payment to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the sole registered owner and the sole holder of the debt securities represented by a global security for all purposes under the indenture.
	Accordingly, we, the trustee and any paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for:



	 





	 




	




	 





	any aspect of DTC s records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in a debt security represented by a
	global security; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial
	interests in a global security held through those participants; or the maintenance, supervision or review of any of DTC s records relating to those beneficial ownership interests.







	DTC has advised us that its current practice is to credit participants accounts on each payment date with payments in amounts
	proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on DTCs records, upon DTCs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information. The underwriters or agents for the debt
	securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as
	is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name, and will be the sole responsibility of those participants. Book-entry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note.





	DTC





	So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner and holder of the debt securities represented by that
	global security for all purposes of the debt securities. Owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of
	the debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered owners or holders of debt securities under the indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of DTC and, if that
	person is not a DTC participant, on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities
	take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form. These laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security. Beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since
	distributions will initially be made to DTC and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account.




	We understand that, under existing industry practices, if we request holders to take any action, or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is
	entitled to take under the indenture, then DTC would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that
	action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.




	Beneficial interests in a
	global security will be shown on, and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants for that global security. The conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to its
	participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect.




	DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a banking
	organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a clearing agency registered
	under the Exchange Act.




	DTC holds the securities of its participants and facilitates the clearance and settlement of
	securities transactions among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The electronic book-entry system eliminates the need for physical certificates. DTCs participants include
	securities brokers and dealers, including underwriters, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of which, and/or their representatives, own DTC. Banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others that
	clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly, also have access to DTCs book-entry system. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.

	DTC has advised us that the above information with respect to DTC has been provided to its
	participants and other members of the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind.





	Clearstream





	Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations, or Clearstream Participants,
	and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of
	certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces
	with domestic securities markets in several countries. As a professional depositary, Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier).
	Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Clearstreams U.S.
	Participants are limited to securities brokers and dealers and banks. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
	Clearstream Participant either directly or indirectly.




	Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially
	through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Clearstream.





	Euroclear





	Euroclear has advised us that it was created to hold securities for participants of Euroclear, or Euroclear Participants, and to clear and
	settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities
	and cash. Euroclear performs various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interacts with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank S.A/N.V., or the Euroclear Operator, under contract
	with Euroclear plc, a U.K. corporation. All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator, not Euroclear plc. Euroclear plc
	establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks, including central banks, securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries. Indirect access to Euroclear is also
	available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.




	The Euroclear Operator is a Belgian bank. As such it is regulated by the Belgian Banking and Finance Commission.




	Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear
	System, and applicable Belgian law, herein the Terms and Conditions. The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with respect to
	securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of
	Euroclear Participants, and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants.




	Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear
	Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Euroclear.

	Table of Contents




	Euroclear has further advised us that investors that acquire, hold and transfer interests in
	the debt securities by book-entry through accounts with the Euroclear Operator or any other securities intermediary are subject to the laws and contractual provisions governing their relationship with their intermediary, as well as the laws and
	contractual provisions governing the relationship between such an intermediary and each other intermediary, if any, standing between themselves and the global securities.





	Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures





	Initial settlement for the debt
	securities will be made in immediately available funds. Secondary market trading between DTC participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds using DTCs Same-Day Funds
	Settlement System. Secondary market trading between Clearstream Participants and/or Euroclear Participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear and will be
	settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately available funds.




	Cross-market transfers
	between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants, on the other, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of
	the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. Depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in
	accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its U.S.
	Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving debt securities through DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC.
	Clearstream Participants and Euroclear Participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. Depositaries.




	Because of time-zone differences, credits of debt securities received through Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities
	settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such debt securities settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear Participants or Clearstream
	Participants on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of debt securities by or through a Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC
	settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.




	If the debt securities are cleared only through Euroclear and Clearstream (and not DTC), you will be able to make and receive through Euroclear and Clearstream payments, deliveries, transfers, exchanges,
	notices, and other transactions involving any securities held through those systems only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers, and other institutions are open for
	business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, U.S. investors who hold their interests in the securities through these systems and wish to transfer their interests, or to receive or make a payment or delivery or
	exercise any other right with respect to their interests, on a particular day may find that the transaction will not be effected until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, as applicable. Thus, U.S. investors who wish to exercise rights
	that expire on a particular day may need to act before the expiration date.




	Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have
	agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be
	modified or discontinued at any time. Neither we nor any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective direct or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and
	procedures governing their operations.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK






	General





	Our authorized
	capital stock consists of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of December 31, 2011, there were 61,803,462 shares of common stock and no
	shares of preferred stock outstanding.




	The following descriptions are summaries of the material terms of our capital stock.
	You should refer to the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and the applicable prospectus supplement for additional information about our capital stock. See Where You Can
	Find More Information.





	Common Stock





	The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. There is no cumulative voting for election of directors.
	Accordingly, the holders of a majority of the shares voted can elect all of the nominees for director. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HMN.




	Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of our common stock are entitled
	to receive ratably those dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding
	preferred stock, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining or distributions to stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. Our
	common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.





	Preferred Stock





	The following description of preferred stock and the description of the terms of a particular series of preferred stock that will be described in the related prospectus supplement are not complete. These
	descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the certificate of designation relating to that series. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock of each series will be fixed by the certificate of
	designation relating to that series. You should read the applicable certificate of designation for a complete description of a series of preferred stock.




	Our board of directors is authorized, without any further vote or action by our stockholders, to cause up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, to be issued from
	time to time in one or more series and to fix, or designate the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the shares of each series, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
	redemption, liquidation preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of the series.




	The specific matters that our board of directors may determine with respect to a series of preferred stock, and which we will describe, where applicable, in a prospectus supplement relating to the series
	of preferred stock, include:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the designation of each series;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the maximum number of shares of each series;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the rate of any dividends, the dates dividends will accrue, whether the series of preferred stock will be issued with an original issue discount and,
	if so, the computed dividend rate on the series of preferred stock, the dividend payment dates and whether dividends will be cumulative;







	 




	17







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	the amount payable in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the terms and conditions of any redemption, including redemption at our option or at the option of the holders, including the time period for
	redemption, and any accumulated dividends or premiums;






	 





	 




	




	 





	rights and terms of any conversion or exchange, including the price or the rate of conversion or exchange and the method, if any, of adjustment;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any sinking fund or similar provision, and, if applicable, the terms and provisions relating to the purpose and operation of the fund;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any voting rights, in addition to voting rights provided by law; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any or all other preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, privileges or qualifications, limitations or restrictions.







	Any or all of these rights may be greater than the rights of the holders of common stock.




	Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of each series of preferred stock will be entitled to receive the liquidation
	preference per share specified in the applicable prospectus supplement plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Holders of preferred stock will be entitled to receive these amounts before any distribution is made to the holders of common stock, but
	only after the liquidation preference has been fully paid on any shares of senior ranking preferred stock or any other senior ranking securities. Neither the par value nor the liquidation preference of any series of preferred stock is indicative of
	the prices at which any shares of preferred stock may trade on or after the date of issuance.




	The preferred stock may have
	voting, conversion or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock. The terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could conceivably prohibit us from:



	 





	 




	




	 





	consummating a merger;






	 





	 




	




	 





	reorganizing;






	 





	 




	




	 





	selling substantially all of our assets;






	 





	 




	




	 





	liquidating; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	engaging in other extraordinary corporate transactions without stockholder approval.







	Preferred stock, or rights to purchase preferred stock, could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay, defer or prevent a change
	in control of us or to make it more difficult to remove our management. For example, a business combination could be impeded by issuing a series of preferred stock containing class voting rights that would enable the holder or holders of this series
	to block that transaction. Alternatively, a business combination could be facilitated by issuing a series of preferred stock with sufficient voting rights to provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders.




	In addition, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock. Although our board
	of directors is required to make any determination to issue any preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, it could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some,
	or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over prevailing market prices of the stock. Our board of directors does not currently intend to seek
	stockholder approval prior to any issuance of preferred stock unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange requirements.

	Table of Contents




	Preferred stock will be fully paid and nonassessable upon issuance. The preferred stock or
	any series of preferred stock may be represented, in whole or in part, by one or more global certificates, which will have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of the preferred stock represented by the global certificate. Each global
	certificate will:



	 





	 




	




	 





	be registered in the name of a depositary or a nominee of the depositary identified in the prospectus supplement;






	 





	 




	




	 





	be deposited with the depositary or nominee or a custodian for the depositary; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	bear a legend regarding the restrictions on exchanges and registration of transfer, and any other matters as may be provided for under the certificate
	of designation.








	Depositary Shares





	We may, at our option, elect to offer fractional shares of preferred stock, or depositary shares, rather than full shares of preferred stock. In that event, we will issue receipts for
	depositary shares, and each receipt will represent a fraction of a share of a particular series of preferred stock as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	The shares of any series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement to be entered into between us and the depositary named in the applicable prospectus
	supplement. The deposit agreement will contain terms applicable to the holders of depositary shares in addition to the terms stated in the depositary receipts. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each owner of a depositary share will be
	entitled, in proportion, to all the rights and preferences of the preferred stock, including dividend, voting, redemption, subscription and liquidation rights. The terms of any depositary shares will be described in the applicable prospectus
	supplement and the provisions of the deposit agreement, which will be filed with the SEC. You should carefully read the deposit agreement and the depositary receipt attached to the deposit agreement for a more complete description of the terms of
	the depositary shares.




	If any series of preferred stock underlying the depositary shares may be converted or exchanged, each
	record holder of depositary receipts representing the shares of preferred stock being converted or exchanged will have the right or obligation to convert or exchange the depositary shares represented by the depositary receipts.




	Whenever we redeem or convert shares of preferred stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem or convert, at the same time,
	the number of depositary shares representing the preferred stock to be redeemed or converted. The depositary will redeem or convert the depositary shares from the proceeds it receives from the corresponding redemption or conversion of the applicable
	series of preferred stock. The redemption or conversion price per depositary share will be equal to the applicable fraction of the redemption or conversion price per share on the applicable series of preferred stock. If less than all the depositary
	shares are to be redeemed or converted, the depositary will select which shares are to be redeemed or converted by lot on a pro rata basis or by any other equitable method as the depositary may decide.




	After the redemption or conversion date, the depositary shares called for redemption or conversion will no longer be outstanding. When
	the depositary shares are no longer outstanding, all rights of the holders will end, except the right to receive money, securities or other property payable upon redemption or conversion.




	We will pay all fees, charges and expenses of the depositary, including the initial deposit of preferred stock and any redemption of the
	preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares will pay taxes and any other charges as are stated in the deposit agreement for their accounts.





	Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors





	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, none of our directors will be personally liable to us or to our stockholders for
	monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duties. The provision effectively eliminates our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. This provision does not,




	 




	19







	Table of Contents




	however, exonerate directors from liability under federal securities laws or for (1) breach of a directors duty of loyalty to us or to our stockholders, (2) acts or omissions not
	in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, (3) specified willful or negligent acts relating to the payment of dividends or the repurchase or redemption of securities or (4) any transaction from which
	a director has derived an improper personal benefit. Our by-laws further provide for indemnification of our officers and directors.





	Delaware Business Combination Statute





	We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a
	business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an
	interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an
	interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own, 15% or more of a corporations voting stock. The
	existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of
	common stock held by stockholders. If any person acquires 15% or more of our outstanding stock, that person will be subject to the provisions of Section 203.








	Transfer Agent and Registrar





	American Stock Transfer & Trust
	Company is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock. We will designate the transfer agent for each series of preferred stock in the applicable prospectus supplement.










	DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS





	We may issue warrants for the purchase of debt or equity securities of Horace Mann or of third parties, including any of our affiliates, or other rights to receive payment in cash or securities based on
	the value, rate or price of one or more specified securities. We may offer warrants separately or together with any other securities in the form of units, as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	The terms of any warrants to be issued and a description of the material provisions of the applicable warrant agreement will be set forth
	in a prospectus supplement.





	Warrants

	Unless otherwise disclosed in any supplement to this prospectus, we will issue warrants under one or more
	warrant agreements to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company, as warrant agent, in one or more series, which will be described in a prospectus supplement for the warrants. The following summaries of significant provisions of the
	warrant agreements are not intended to be comprehensive and you should review the detailed provisions of the relevant warrant agreement to be filed with the SEC in a prospectus supplement in connection with the offering of specific warrants for a
	full description and for other information regarding the warrants.





	Significant Provisions of the Warrant Agreements





	The following terms and conditions of the warrant agreement will apply to each warrant, unless otherwise specified in the applicable
	prospectus supplement:





	Modifications without Consent of Warrant Holder

	. We and the warrant agent may amend the terms
	of the warrants and the warrant certificates without the consent of the holders to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	cure any ambiguity;






	 





	 




	




	 





	cure, correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision;






	 





	 




	




	 





	amend the terms in any other manner which we may deem necessary or desirable and which will not adversely affect the interests of the affected holders
	in any material respect; or







	 




	21







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	reduce the exercise price of the warrants.








	Modifications with Consent of Warrant Holders

	. We and the warrant agent, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in number of the then outstanding unexercised warrants affected,
	may modify or amend the warrant agreements. However, we and the warrant agent may not make any of the following modifications or amendments without the consent of each affected warrant holder:



	 





	 




	




	 





	increase the exercise price of the warrants;






	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce the amount or number receivable upon exercise, cancellation or expiration of the warrants other than in accordance with the antidilution
	provisions or other similar adjustment provisions included in the terms of the warrants;






	 





	 




	




	 





	shorten the period of time during which the warrants may be exercised;






	 





	 




	




	 





	materially and adversely affect the rights of the owners of the warrants; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce the percentage of outstanding warrants the consent of whose owners is required for the modification of the applicable warrant agreement.








	Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets

	. If at any time we merge or consolidate or transfer
	substantially all of our assets, the successor corporation will succeed to and assume all of our obligations under each warrant agreement and the warrants. We will then be relieved of any further obligation under the warrant agreements and the
	warrants issued thereunder.





	Enforceability of Rights of Warrant Holders

	. The warrant agent will act solely as our
	agent in connection with the warrant certificates and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any holders of warrant certificates or beneficial owners of warrants. Any holder of warrant certificates and any
	beneficial owner of warrants, without the consent of any other person, may enforce by appropriate legal action, on its own behalf, its right to exercise the warrants evidenced by the warrant certificates in the manner provided for in that series of
	warrants or pursuant to the applicable warrant agreement. No holder of any warrant certificate or beneficial owner of any warrants will be entitled to any of the rights of a holder of the debt securities or any other securities, including common
	shares, preferred stock, or any other warrant property purchasable upon exercise of the warrants, including the right to receive dividends, if any, or interest on any securities, the right to receive payments on debt securities or any other warrant
	property or to enforce any of the covenants or rights in the relevant indenture or any other similar agreement.





	Registration and Transfer of Warrants

	DESCRIPTION OF DELAYED DELIVERY CONTRACTS





	We
	may issue delayed delivery contracts for the purchase or sale of our debt securities or equity securities or securities of third parties including any of our affiliates, a basket of such securities, an index or indices of such securities or any
	combination of the above as specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	Table of Contents




	We may issue delayed delivery contracts obligating holders to purchase from us, and
	obligating us to sell to holders, at a future date, a specified or varying number of securities at a purchase price, which may be based on a formula. Alternatively, we may issue delayed delivery contracts obligating us to purchase from holders, and
	obligating holders to sell to us, at a future date, a specified or varying number of securities at a purchase price, which may be based on a formula. We may satisfy our obligations, if any, with respect to any delayed delivery contract by delivering
	the subject securities or by delivering the cash value of such delayed delivery contract or the cash value of the property otherwise deliverable, as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus supplement will specify
	the methods by which the holders may purchase or sell such securities and any acceleration, cancellation or termination provisions or other provisions relating to the settlement of a delayed delivery contract.




	The delayed delivery contracts may require us to make periodic payments to the holders thereof or vice versa, and these payments may be
	unsecured or prefunded and may be paid on a current or deferred basis. The delayed delivery contracts may require holders thereof to secure their obligations under the contracts in a specified manner to be described in the applicable prospectus
	supplement. Alternatively, delayed delivery contracts may require holders to satisfy their obligations thereunder when the delayed delivery contracts are issued as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.










	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION





	We may offer and sell the securities described in this prospectus:



	 





	 




	




	 





	through agents;






	 





	 




	




	 





	through one or more underwriters or dealers;






	 





	 




	




	 





	through a block trade in which the broker or dealer engaged to handle the block trade will attempt to sell the securities as agent, but may position
	and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;






	 





	 




	




	 





	directly to one or more purchasers (through a specific bidding or auction process or otherwise);






	 





	 




	




	 





	in at the market offerings, within the meaning of Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act;






	 





	 




	




	 





	through a combination of any of these methods of sale; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	at a fixed exchange ratio in return for other of our securities.







	The distribution of the securities described in this prospectus may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions either:



	 





	 




	




	 





	at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;






	 





	 




	




	 





	at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;






	 





	 




	




	 





	at prices relating to the prevailing market prices; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	at negotiated prices.







	Offers to purchase the securities may be solicited by agents designated by us from time to time. Any agent involved in the offer or sale of the securities will be named, and any commissions payable by us
	to the agent will be described, in the applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, any such agent will be acting on a best efforts basis for the period of its appointment. Any agent may be
	deemed to be an underwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, of the securities so offered and sold.




	 




	23







	Table of Contents




	If we offer and sell securities through an underwriter or underwriters, we will execute an
	underwriting agreement with the underwriter or underwriters. The names of the specific managing underwriter or underwriters, as well as any other underwriters, and the terms of the transactions, including compensation of the underwriters and
	dealers, which may be in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions, if any, will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement, which will be used by the underwriters to make resales of the securities.




	If we offer and sell securities through a dealer, we or an underwriter will sell the securities to the dealer, as principal. The dealer
	may then resell the securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by the dealer at the time of resale. The name of the dealer and the terms of the transactions will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any dealer may
	be deemed to be an underwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act, of the securities so offered and sold.




	We may
	solicit offers to purchase the securities directly and we may sell the securities directly to institutional or other investors. The terms of these sales, including the terms of any bidding or auction process, if utilized, will be described in the
	applicable prospectus supplement. We may enter into agreements with agents, underwriters and dealers under which we may agree to indemnify the agents, underwriters and dealers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
	Act, or to contribute to payments they may be required to make with respect to these liabilities. The terms and conditions of this indemnification or contribution will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Some of the agents,
	underwriters or dealers, or their affiliates, may be customers of, engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary course of business.




	If the applicable prospectus supplement indicates, we may authorize agents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities at the public offering price
	under delayed delivery contracts. These contracts would provide for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. The contracts would be subject only to those conditions described in the prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus
	supplement will describe the commissions payable for solicitation of those contracts.




	We may from time to time engage a firm
	to act as our agent for one or more offerings of our securities. We sometimes refer to this agent as our offering agent. If we reach an agreement with an offering agent with respect to a specific offering, including the number of
	securities and any minimum price below which sales may not be made, then the offering agent will try to sell such securities on the agreed terms. The offering agent could make sales in privately negotiated transactions or any other method permitted
	by law, including sales deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, or sales made to or through a market maker
	other than on an exchange. The offering agent will be deemed to be an underwriter, as that term is defined in the Securities Act with respect to any sales effected through an at the market offering.




	Unless indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, all debt securities, depositary shares, warrants and preferred stock will be
	new issues of securities with no established trading market. Unless indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we do not expect to list the securities on a securities exchange, except for the common stock, which is listed on the New York
	Stock Exchange. Underwriters involved in the public offering and sale of these securities may make a market in the securities. They are not obligated to make a market, however, and may discontinue market making activity at any time. We cannot give
	any assurance as to the liquidity of the trading market for any of these securities.




	In connection with any particular
	offering pursuant to this shelf registration statement, an underwriter may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids.



	 





	 




	




	 





	Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum price.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Over-allotment involves sales by an underwriter of securities in excess of the number of securities an underwriter is obligated to purchase, which
	creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of securities over-allotted by an underwriter is not greater than the number of
	securities that it may purchase pursuant to an over-allotment option. In a naked short position the number of securities involved is greater than the number of securities in an over-allotment option. An underwriter may close out any short position
	by either exercising its over-allotment option and/or purchasing securities in the open market.







	 




	24







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
	syndicate short positions where there is an over-allotment option. In determining the source of securities to close out the short position, an underwriter will consider, among other things, the price of securities available for purchase in the open
	market as compared to the price at which they may purchase securities through the over-allotment option. If an underwriter sells more securities than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be
	closed out by buying securities in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if an underwriter is concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the securities in the open market after pricing that could
	adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Penalty bids permit representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the syndicate member
	are purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.







	These
	stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our securities or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the securities. As a result, the
	price of our securities may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.




	We, the underwriters or other agents may engage in derivative transactions involving the securities. These derivatives may consist of
	short sale transactions and other hedging activities. The underwriters or agents may acquire a long or short position in the securities, hold or resell securities acquired and purchase options or futures on the securities and other derivative
	instruments with returns linked to or related to changes in the price of the securities. In order to facilitate these derivative transactions, we may enter into security lending or repurchase agreements with the underwriters or agents. The
	underwriters or agents may effect the derivative transactions through sales of the securities to the public, including short sales, or by lending the securities in order to facilitate short sale transactions by others. The underwriters or agents may
	also use the securities purchased or borrowed from us or others (or, in the case of derivatives, securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives) to directly or indirectly settle sales of the securities or close out any related open
	borrowings of the securities.




	We may also make sales through the Internet or through other electronic means. Since we may
	from time to time elect to offer securities directly to the public, with or without the involvement of agents, underwriters or dealers, utilizing the Internet (sometimes referred to as the world wide web) or other forms of electronic
	bidding or ordering systems for the pricing and allocation of such securities, you will want to pay particular attention to the description of that system we will provide in a prospectus supplement.




	Such electronic system may allow bidders to directly participate, through electronic access to an auction site, by submitting conditional
	offers to buy that are subject to acceptance by us, and which may directly affect the price or other terms and conditions at which such securities are sold. These bidding or ordering systems may present to each bidder, on a so-called
	real-time basis, relevant information to assist in making a bid, such as the clearing spread at which the offering would be sold, based on the bids submitted, and whether a bidders individual bids would be accepted, prorated or
	rejected. For example, in the case of a debt security, the clearing spread could be indicated as a number of basis points above an index treasury note. Of course, many pricing methods can and may also be used.




	Upon completion of such an electronic auction process, securities will be allocated based on prices bid, terms of bid or other factors.
	The final offering price at which securities would be sold and the allocation of securities among bidders would be based in whole or in part on the results of the Internet or other electronic bidding process or auction.




	In connection with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority guidelines, the maximum compensation to the underwriters in connection with
	the sale of securities pursuant to this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement will not exceed 8% of the total offering price to the public of such securities as set forth on the cover page of each prospectus supplement.

	VALIDITY OF SECURITIES





	The validity of the debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants and delayed delivery contracts offered by
	this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, New York, NY, counsel to Horace Mann. If legal matters in connection with offerings made by this prospectus are passed on by counsel for the underwriters of an
	offering of the securities, that counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement.







	INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	The consolidated financial statements and schedules of Horace Mann Educators Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and for
	each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 have been incorporated by reference herein in
	reliance upon the report of KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, incorporated by reference herein, and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing.




	The audit report covering the December 31, 2010 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph that states the Company changed
	its method of accounting for other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities due to the adoption of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, (included in FASB
	ASC Topic 320,

	Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

	), as of April 1, 2009.




	With respect to the unaudited
	interim financial information for the periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, June 30, 2011 and 2010 and September 30, 2011 and 2010, incorporated by reference herein, the independent registered public accounting firm has reported that
	they applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a review of such information. However, their separate reports included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2011,
	June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011, and incorporated herein by reference, state that they did not audit and they do not express an opinion on that interim financial information. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on their reports on
	such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied. The independent registered public accounting firm is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for
	its reports on the unaudited interim financial information because those reports are not a report or a part of the registration statement prepared or certified by the independent registered public accounting firm within the
	meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Securities Act of 1933.

	Indemnification of Directors and Officers










	Horace Mann is a Delaware corporation. Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware empowers a Delaware corporation to indemnify any persons who are, or are threatened to be
	made, parties to any threatened, pending or completed legal action, suit or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than action by or in the right of such corporation), by reason of the fact that such person was
	an officer or director of such corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys fees),
	judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, provided that such officer or director acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
	be in or not opposed to the corporations best interests, and, for criminal proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was illegal. A Delaware corporation may indemnify officers and directors in an action by or in the right of
	the corporation under the same conditions, except that no indemnification is permitted without judicial approval if the officer or director is adjudged to be liable to the corporation in the performance of his duty. Where an officer or director is
	successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, the corporation must indemnify him against the expenses which such officer or director actually and reasonably incurred.




	Article 9 of Horace Manns Certificate of Incorporation provides as follows:




	Ninth. The Corporation shall indemnify each Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation and each person who is or was serving
	at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in the manner and to the extent provided in the By-laws of the Corporation as the same may be
	amended from time to time.




	 




	II-1







	Table of Contents




	Article 8 of Horace Manns by-laws provides as follows:




	Section 8.1. 

	General.

	The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
	party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
	Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
	expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such
	person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or
	proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to
	be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.




	Section 8.2. Derivative Actions. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
	party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is
	or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably
	incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and
	except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
	or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in the view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for
	such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.




	Section 8.3. Indemnification in
	Certain Cases. To the extent that a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in Sections 8.1. and 8.2. of this
	Article 8, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.




	Section 8.4. Procedure. Any indemnification under Sections 8.1. and 8.2. of this Article 8 (unless ordered by a
	court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the Director, Officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable
	standard of conduct set forth in said Sections 8.1. and 8.2. Such determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, or
	(b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the Stockholders.




	Section 8.5. Advances for Expenses. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding shall be
	paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, Officer, employee, or agent to repay such amount if it shall be ultimately determined
	that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article 8.




	Section 8.6. 

	Rights Not Exclusive.

	The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article 8 shall
	not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law, by-law, agreement, vote of Stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in the
	official capacity of such person and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors,
	and administrators of such a person. Any repeal, modification, or amendment of this Article 8 shall not adversely affect any rights or obligations then existing between the Corporation and any then incumbent or former Director, Officer,
	employee, or agent with respect to any facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit, or proceeding theretofore brought based in whole or in part upon such facts.

	Section 8.7. Insurance. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain
	insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
	venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of the status of such person as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
	indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article 8.




	Section 8.8. Definition
	of Corporation. For the purposes of this Article 8, references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
	consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its Directors, Officers, employees, and agents, so that any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of such
	constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
	under the provisions of this




	Article 8 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have
	with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.




	Section 8.9. 

	Definition of
	Other Terms.

	For the purpose of this Article 8, references to other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans; references to fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any
	employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include service as a Director, Officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such Director,
	Officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
	of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation as referred to in this Article 8.




	In addition, the Registrant has purchased insurance which insures (subject to certain terms and conditions, exclusions and deductibles) it against certain costs which it might be required to pay by way of
	indemnification to its directors and officers under its certificate of incorporation, indemnification agreements or otherwise and protects individual directors and officers from certain losses for which they might not be indemnified by the
	Registrant. In addition, the Registrant has purchased insurance which provides liability coverage (subject to certain terms and conditions, exclusions and deductibles) for amounts which it, or the fiduciaries under its employee benefit plans (which
	may include its directors, officers and employees), might be required to pay as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty.




	In
	addition, Horace Mann has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain officers that provide for the maximum indemnification permitted by law.

	(ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the
	effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range
	may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the

	required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by
	reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.




	(2) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
	therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.




	(3) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.




	(4) that, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser:




	(i) If the registrant is relying on Rule 430B:




	(A) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration
	statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and




	(B) Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule
	415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such
	form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that
	date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
	be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	Provided

	,

	however

	, that no statement
	made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement
	will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such
	document immediately prior to such effective date;




	(ii) If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each
	prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of the registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of
	and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness.

	Provided

	,

	however

	, that no statement made in the registration
	statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated by or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a
	purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior
	to such date of first use.




	(5) that, for the purpose of determining any liability of the registrant under the
	Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the
	underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be
	considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:




	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of
	the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;




	(ii) Any free
	writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;




	(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the
	undersigned registrant; and




	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the
	undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	(b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining
	any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to
	Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time
	shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.




	(c) The registrant hereby undertakes to deliver or cause
	to be delivered with the prospectus, to each person to whom the prospectus is sent or given, the latest annual report to security holders that is incorporated by reference in the prospectus and furnished pursuant to and meeting the requirements of
	Rule 14a-3 or Rule 14c-3 under the Exchange Act, and, where interim financial information required to be presented by Article 3 of Regulations S-X are not set forth in the prospectus, to deliver, or cause to be delivered to each person to whom
	the prospectus is sent or given, the latest quarterly report that is specifically incorporated by reference in the prospectus to provide such interim financial information.




	(d) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the provisions described in
	Item 15 hereof, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
	indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
	by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Re:




	Horace Mann Educators Corporation








	 




	Registration Statement on Form S-3






	Ladies and
	Gentlemen:




	We have acted as counsel to Horace Mann Educators Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the 

	Company

	), in
	connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	Commission

	) of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the 

	Registration Statement

	) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
	amended (the 

	Securities Act

	), relating to the registration under the Securities Act and the proposed issuance and sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, together or separately and in one or more
	series (if applicable) of:




	(i) the Companys unsecured debt securities, which may either be senior debt securities
	(

	Senior Debt Securities

	) or subordinated debt securities (the 

	Subordinated Debt Securities

	 and, together with the Senior Debt Securities, the 

	Debt Securities

	);




	(ii) shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the 

	Common Stock

	);




	(iii) shares of the Companys preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the 

	Preferred Stock

	);




	(iv) depositary shares each representing a fraction of a share of a particular series of Preferred Stock (the 

	Depositary
	Shares

	);




	(v) warrants for the purchase of debt or equity securities of the Company or third parties (the
	

	Warrants

	); and




	(vi) delayed delivery contracts for the purchase or sale of certain specified securities
	(the 

	Delayed Delivery Contracts

	).




	The Senior Debt Securities are to be issued under an indenture to be entered into
	between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the 

	Trust Company

	), as indenture trustee (the 

	Senior Base Indenture

	). The Subordinated Debt Securities are to be issued under an indenture
	to be entered into between the Company and Trust Company, as indenture trustee (the 

	Subordinated Base Indenture

	 and together with the Senior Base Indenture, the 

	Base Indentures

	).

	In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have examined originals, or copies certified or
	otherwise identified to our satisfaction as being true and complete copies of the originals, of forms of the Base Indentures, forms of the Debt Securities, specimen Common Stock certificates and such other documents, corporate records, certificates
	of officers of the Company and of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable to enable us to render these opinions. In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and
	competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to these opinions, we have relied to the
	extent we deemed appropriate and without independent investigation upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company and others.




	We have assumed without independent investigation that:




	(i) at the time any
	Securities are sold pursuant to the Registration Statement (the 

	Relevant Time

	), the Registration Statement and any supplements and amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments) will be effective and will comply with all
	applicable laws;




	(ii) at the Relevant Time, a prospectus supplement will have been prepared and filed with the Commission
	describing the Securities offered thereby and all related documentation and will comply with all applicable laws;




	(iii) all
	Securities will be issued and sold in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the applicable prospectus supplement;




	(iv) at the Relevant Time, all corporate or other action required to be taken by the Company to duly authorize each proposed issuance of
	Securities and any related documentation (including (i) the due reservation of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock for issuance upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any Securities for Common Stock or Preferred Stock (a
	

	Convertible Security

	), and (ii) the execution (in the case of certificated Securities), delivery and performance of the Securities and any related documentation referred to in paragraphs 1 through 6 below) shall have been
	duly completed and shall remain in full force and effect;




	(v) upon issuance of any Common Stock or Preferred Stock, including
	upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Security, the total number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock issued and outstanding will not exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable,
	that the Company is then authorized to issue under its certificate of incorporation and other relevant documents;

	(vi) in the case of Debt Securities, at the Relevant Time, the relevant Base Indenture
	shall have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and all other parties thereto and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended; and




	(vii) at the Relevant Time, a definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement and any other necessary agreement with respect to any Securities offered or issued will have been duly authorized by
	all necessary corporate or other action of the Company and duly executed and delivered by the Company and the other parties thereto.




	Based on

	C. We express no opinion regarding the effectiveness of
	(i) any waiver of stay, extension or usury laws or of unknown future rights or (ii) provisions relating to indemnification, exculpation or contribution, to the extent such provisions may be held unenforceable as contrary to public policy
