Testimonials 

A Great Piece of KitThe GP105 trailer you sold me last March performed flawlessly on our month long motorcycle tour of Europe. A great piece of kit.
Tony Delaney
Great Build Quality‘Having researched the market for a replacement 14ft tri axle cattle trailer, we are delighted with the Nugent trailer now having had it for 18 months. The build quality is such that it is significantly more robust than its competitors and yet its weight still allows us to have two mature bulls on board and still be within the towing capacity of 3.5 tonnes. Just as importantly when it is either fully laden or empty it tows like a dream.’
David Evans
Nugent PoemIf you want to buy a trailer that you can trust
Head straight to Nugent trailers now that is a must.
They manufacture and distribute throughout Ireland and UK
They really are the finest trailers on the market today.
So if you buy a Nugent Trailer you will have peace of mind
Knowing there is no better trailer out there, they are one of a kind.
Nugent Facebook FanGreat TrailersWe just received the load.  Wow! Great trailers. I hadn’t expected them to be so strong. I’m really looking forward to showing them to our customers.

Cattle Handling Equipment







Weigh PlatformCattle CrushesHead Locking GatesRear GatesOptional Extras
For generations the Nugent family has been steeped in Agricultural traditions. Using his engineering expertise to facilitate his agricultural requirements on the farm, Sean Nugent the founder of Nugent Engineering began the manufacture of Cattle Crushes to handle and restrain the animal and this is where the Nugent story began over 25 years ago.
As cattle breeding intensified in the 70’s and 80’s there were more demands on the farmer who needed help with production, hence the need for cattle handling equipment. Sean developed the products to suit the demanding irish breeds which resulted in heavy duty crushes to suit heavier handling. With Nugent’s trademark durable construction the cattle handling equipment is designed to last.
Nugent Engineering is at the cutting edge of agricultural equipment design with an extensive and flexible range of cattle handling equipment. For over twenty five years Nugent Engineering has been developing the range and specialises in the design and manufacture of some of the finest crushes on the market today. New methods of production has translated to product innovations and designs.
As leaders in the Irish market Nugent Engineering has invested heavily in research and development and has brought to market a new generation of versatile, robust, heavy duty crushes providing excellent access for general handling. The Nugent Cattle Handling Equipment is designed to suit the requirements of the modern day farmer whilst ensuring safety and reducing stress for both the handler and livestock.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
