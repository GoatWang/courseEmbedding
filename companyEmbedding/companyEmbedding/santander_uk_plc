The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]

Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]

The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]

Santander UK plc is a British bank, wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group. Santander UK plc manages its affairs autonomously, with its own local management team, responsible solely for its performance. Santander UK is one of the UK's leading personal financial services companies and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in the UK. The bank has circa 20,000 employees, 14 million active customers, with almost 1,010 branches and 50 corporate business centres.
The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]




A rebranded branch of Santander in Peterborough


Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]




A branch of Santander on Briggate, Leeds


The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]

Ad description
A TV ad for Santander's All in One credit card, seen on 1 November 2016, showed customers in a shop choosing a computer game; a group of friends watching a TV programme; a man at home scrolling through holiday photos on a tablet; a couple discussing their finances and their young daughter playing a drum kit. The voice-over stated, "With the new Santander All in One credit card you get cashback on all your purchases ... there's no fee when spending abroad ... and 0% on balance transfers for 40 months ... get a little bit more out of life with the new Santander All in One credit card. Buy online or in branch today. Simple. Simple, personal, fair. It's what a bank should be." On-screen text stated "0.5% cashback. Retailer and ATM fees may apply abroad. 1% Balance Transfer fee. Representative Example 0% p.a. on purchases for 6 months then 15.9% p.a. (variable). Equivalent to 21.7% APR representative (variable) based on £1200 credit limit. Monthly fee £3".
Issue
A viewer challenged whether the ad breached the Code because the representative APR (Annual Percentage Rate) was not given adequate prominence as required.
Response
Santander UK plc said their understanding of the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) was that the ad needed to include a representative example (RE) of credit because it contained an indication of a rate of interest and an amount relating to the cost of credit. Their understanding was that the representative annual percentage rate (RAPR) should not be given greater prominence than any other element of the RE, and that the RE itself should have no less prominence than the incentive for taking out credit, or any other information relating to the cost of credit.Santander believed the RE was clearly identified in the ad as such; was clear and legible; and was on the screen from the start of the ad which gave viewers adequate time to read it. They did not believe there was anything in the ad, which included the visual footage of customers and people in other situations, which increased the prominence of the incentive for taking out credit or other information relating to the cost of credit. They believed the information about the key features and benefits of the card (i.e. cashback on all purchases; no fees applied when spending abroad; and 0% on balance transfers for 40 months) was likely to be understood simply as product information rather than comparisons with other products.Santander said they had used bold text to state the key elements of the RE and RAPR. Together with the size of the font and the length of time for which it was on the screen, they believed that made the RE and RAPR equally prominent as the incentives which were stated in the voice-over. They said that, in consumer testing they had carried out in the past, respondents said they would read text if they were interested in the product being advertised; that the longer the words were on the screen and the larger they were, the more likely they would notice them; that numbers were more likely to be noticed than words; and that short points were more noticeable than long. They also believed it was important to take into account how compelling, fast-moving or colourful the visual footage was. Santander said they had borne those points in mind in this ad and believed it would not be in line with CONC to make the RAPR any more prominent.Clearcast said that, having sought confirmation from Santander's compliance team that the ad complied with CONC, they believed that because the three APR figures were appropriately highlighted in a bolder font than the text either side of it, the text was legible; was on-screen for sufficient time; and that the incentives to take out credit were no more prominent than the rate of interest.
Assessment
UpheldThe ASA noted that CONC rule 3.5.7 (1) stated that an ad must include a RAPR if it included, amongst other elements, an incentive to apply for credit or a favourable comparison relating to the credit.We considered that, in the context of an ad that invited consumers to apply for a credit card, cashback on all purchases and no fee when spending abroad were likely to be seen as incentives to apply for credit, and also as favourable comparisons with other credit providers who might not offer those features. We noted that the ad featured three interest rates (0%, 15.9% and the RAPR). Consequently, requirements to include a RAPR as well as a RE were triggered.We noted that CONC rules 3.5.7 (2) in relation to the RAPR and 3.5.5 (d) in relation to the RE stated that the RAPR and the RE must be given no less prominence than the information which triggered their inclusion. In the ad, the RAPR and the RE were presented in on-screen text which included other information and was present along the bottom of the screen for half of the ad's duration. We considered the size of the text and the time for which it was on-screen was sufficient for it to be clear to viewers and we noted the reasons Santander had given for believing the ad was compliant.However, we noted that the ad included visual footage that showed customers making purchases in a shop, scrolling through holiday photographs and having discussions about their finances. The ad also invited consumers to apply for a credit card that included cashback on purchases, no fee when spending abroad and 0% on balance transfers for 40 months among its features. In the context of this ad, we considered the visual footage emphasised, and therefore added prominence to, the features being stated in the voice-over. In that context, we considered the information communicated to viewers in on-screen text was likely to be seen as less prominent than information communicated verbally, with or without additional visual emphasis and that, in this case, the use of on-screen text to present the RAPR and RE was unlikely to meet CONC's requirements that it be given no less prominence than the information which triggered their inclusion. For that reason, we concluded that the ad breached the Code.The ad breached BCAP Code rule 
14.11


14.11
The advertising of unsecured consumer credit or hire services by consumer credit businesses or consumer hire businesses and / or credit brokering  businesses or related credit services, such as debt counselling or debt adjusting is acceptable only if the advertiser complies with the financial promotions requirements imposed by FSMA and the FCA's rules set out in Chapter 3 of CONC..  The requirements for financial promotions set out in Chapter 3 of CONC do not apply: (a) where the credit is available only to a company or other body corporate (such as a limited liability partnership); (b) where a financial promotion is solely promoting credit agreements or consumer hire agreements or P2P lending agreements for the purposes of a customer's business; (c) to a financial promotion to the extent that it relates to qualifying credit or (d) it falls within the definition of an excluded communication as set out in the FCA's handbook. If the applicability or interpretation of these rules or provisions is in doubt, advertisers may contact the FCA. The FCA does not check financial promotions for compliance with the CONC rules before they are published. Such advertisements that involve distance marketing must also comply with the Financial Services (Distance Marketing) Regulations 2004 (as amended). Other distance-marketing financial advertisements are covered by the FCA Handbook.


 (Lending and credit).
Action
The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form. We told Santander UK plc to ensure its advertising complied with the requirements of CONC.

Santander UK plc is a British bank, wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group. Santander UK plc manages its affairs autonomously, with its own local management team, responsible solely for its performance. Santander UK is one of the UK's leading personal financial services companies and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in the UK. The bank has circa 20,000 employees, 14 million active customers, with almost 1,010 branches and 50 corporate business centres.
The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]




A rebranded branch of Santander in Peterborough


Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]




A branch of Santander on Briggate, Leeds


The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]

Santander UK plc is a British bank, wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group. Santander UK plc manages its affairs autonomously, with its own local management team, responsible solely for its performance. Santander UK is one of the UK's leading personal financial services companies and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in the UK. The bank has circa 20,000 employees, 14 million active customers, with almost 1,010 branches and 50 corporate business centres.
The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]




A rebranded branch of Santander in Peterborough


Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]




A branch of Santander on Briggate, Leeds


The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]

Santander UK plc is a British bank, wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group. Santander UK plc manages its affairs autonomously, with its own local management team, responsible solely for its performance. Santander UK is one of the UK's leading personal financial services companies and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in the UK. The bank has circa 20,000 employees, 14 million active customers, with almost 1,010 branches and 50 corporate business centres.
The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]




A rebranded branch of Santander in Peterborough


Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]




A branch of Santander on Briggate, Leeds


The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]
