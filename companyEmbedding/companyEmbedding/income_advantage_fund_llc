Fidelity Income Advantage&reg










The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment returns and the principal value of a variable annuity will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when money is withdrawn or received.  Fund performance fluctuates and currently may be significantly higher or lower than stated.
The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on a risk-adjusted return.  The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Morningstar information contained herein; (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its affiliates; (2)  may not be copied or distributed; (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and you should check the fund's current prospectus for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.
Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options.  For this and other information, call Fidelity at 1-800-544-4936 for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information, or view one online. Read it carefully before you invest.
ANNUITY FUND PERFORMANCE:

Returns include the 1.00% annual annuity charge. Certain funds have voluntary expense limits. Without these expense reimbursements, returns would have been lower.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative from the inception date indicated.

Performance returns reflect the subaccount inception, the date each portfolio was first available in the insurance company's variable product.
Total returns include changes in share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
Unless otherwise noted, returns are adjusted for all applicable recurring and non-recurring fees (including redemption fees), loads and charges, if any.
VIP refers to Variable Insurance Products.
You could lose money by investing in the Fidelity VIP Government Money Market Portfolio. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.  An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
The fund will not impose a fee upon the sale of its shares, nor temporarily suspend the ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
On December 1, 2015, Fidelity VIP Money Market changed its name to Fidelity VIP Government Money Market and will operate under certain different investment policies. The historical performance may not represent its current investment policies.
Withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59 1/2, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
ABOUT MORGAN STANLEY FUNDS: Morgan Stanley refers to Morgan Stanley Variable Insurance Fund Inc.
Prior to May 1, 2015, the Morgan Stanley Global Strategist Fund was known as Morgan Stanley Global Tactical Asset Allocation Fund.
