*Generally, New Mountain Senior Advisors are similar to "Operating Partners" who provide general or specific industry expertise on particular projects or transactions.  All persons listed in the Senior Advisors (Full Access) category are designated “access persons” pursuant to Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are subject to New Mountain’s Code of Ethics, which therefore allows them to be fully included in New Mountain’s investment reviews.  Based on a variety of factors, the Senior Advisors for Special Projects (Matthew Ebbel, Judd Gregg and Frederic Salerno) are designated as “non-access persons” and are not subject to New Mountain’s Code of Ethics, which results in more limited or specialized roles.   List does not include Robert Grusky, who is non-exclusive to New Mountain.  Additionally, Robert Grusky is engaged in unrelated investment activities in connection with his own firm.

Private Equity


Strategy   |   Portfolio Companies







New Mountain’s private equity funds seek to acquire the highest quality leaders in carefully selected "defensive growth" industries, and then to build those businesses. The firm generally seeks to acquire just three or four companies each year, typically in the $100 million to $1 billion enterprise value range, and generally invests $100 million to $500 million per transaction.
Read More...New Mountain’s past and present portfolio companies are described on this website and are generally characterized by:

Market leadership in sustainable and noncyclical growth niches
High barriers to competitive entry
Strong downside protection in all reasonable worst-case scenarios
The opportunity for substantial value creation due to rapid growth or to special factors existing at the time of the investment

New Mountain emphasizes growth and business building, rather than excessive risk and debt, as the best path to private equity returns. The firm generally uses debt moderately (and in some cases, has used no debt at all) and New Mountain has never had a private equity portfolio company bankruptcy or missed an interest payment. We have consistently identified industries top down and proactively before an auction process began.
Once an investment is made, New Mountain works to help management add value to these companies, in order to create much larger and more profitable "new mountains" in their own industries.
Chief executives of New Mountain portfolio companies have been strong references for our Firm, and the variety of ways that New Mountain has helped management teams add value include:

Providing growth capital
Increasing management ownership
Developing and supporting new growth strategies
Seeking out, supporting and executing add-on acquisitions
Recruiting high quality board members
Strengthening management teams
Supporting technology and infrastructure upgrades
Supporting increased research and development
Making high level sales contacts on the company's behalf
Establishing strong financial Wall Street coverage and support
Establishing improved financial systems and controls

Since inception, New Mountain Capital has raised over $15.0 billion of committed capital across five private equity funds. We are currently investing capital committed to our fifth fund, New Mountain Partners V, during the first close. Our firm has been awarded numerous “private equity firm of the year” and similar honors since our founding in January 2000.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

I get better service from 7-11. Their transactions take days and days to post, meanwhile their system tells you you have money you can use....show more
