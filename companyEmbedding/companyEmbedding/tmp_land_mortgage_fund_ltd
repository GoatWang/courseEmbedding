Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(Unaudited)



NOTE 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Accounting  Method- TMP Land Mortgage Fund, Ltd. (the Partnership)  prepares its
financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting.



Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of the  Partnership  and its  majority-owned  investments,  TMP  Homes
Remington,  LLC (Remington) and TMP Homes  Flowerfield-Sun City, LLC (Sun City).
All significant  intercompany  accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Allowance for Losses on Loans - No provision has been made for an
allowance for losses on loans.



Income  Taxes - The entity is treated as a  partnership  for income tax purposes
and any  income or loss is passed  through  and  taxable at the  partner  level.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes is provided.
NOTE 2 - Allocation of Profits, Losses and Cash Distributions


Profit,  losses, and cash distributions are allocated ninety-nine percent to the
limited  partners  and one  percent to the  general  partners  until the limited
partners  have received an amount equal to their  capital  contributions  plus a
cumulative,  non-compounded  return of eight  percent  per annum  based on their
adjusted capital account balances, at which time, remaining profits,  losses and
cash distributions are allocated seventy-six percent to the limited partners and
twenty-four  percent  to  the  general  partners.  Distributions  of  cash  from
operations, if any, are made monthly within 30 days after the end of the month.



NOTE 3 - Investment in Unimproved Land



The  Partnership  had made twelve land loans as of March 31, 1997.  Three of the
loans had been repaid in full, and nine of the loans had  defaulted.  On all the
defaults  which had  occurred,  the  Partnership  foreclosed  on the  properties
securing the loans.







NOTE 4 - Restatements and reissuances of 1994 - 1996 Financial Statements



In 1992,  the  Partnership  made two loans  totaling  $3,500,000 to PR Equities,
Ltd., a California  Limited  Partnership.  The loans were secured by first trust
deeds on residential property located in San Jacinto,  California.  In 1994, the
Partnership  foreclosed on the properties  securing these loans and continues to
own  these  properties.   In  accordance  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles,  assets acquired through foreclosure should be recorded at the lower
of cost or fair value less costs of  disposal  at the date of  foreclosure.  The
1994-1997 financial  statements  originally issued reported this property at the
amount of the  outstanding  mortgage  balances due on these loans at the time of
foreclosure, which did not represent

NOTE 4 - Restatements and reissuances of 1994 - 1996 Financial Statements,

their fair value less costs of disposal.  Management has subsequently determined
that a valuation allowance for these properties should have been established for
approximately  $3.8 million at the date of  foreclosure  in 1994.  The valuation
allowance  should have been  adjusted  each year  thereafter  such that the only
value for  these  properties  is the  capitalized  direct  carrying  costs  that
represent the total accumulated  property taxes and Mello-Roos bond assessments.
Therefore, the consolidated financial statements for 1994 through 1996 have been
restated to record the  valuation  allowance  and to adjust these  properties to
their fair value for those years.


In addition, management has determined that the amount of property taxes payable
as recorded in June, 1994, and subsequent periods through 1998, were understated
by approximately  $556,000.  Accordingly,  the consolidated financial statements
for those  periods have been restated for this  understatement  by adjusting the
carrying  value of the land and the property  taxes  payable in the  appropriate
fiscal years.


In accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  the financial
statements of  majority-owned  investments are required to be consolidated.  The
1995,  1996 and 1997  financial  statements  originally  issued did not properly
account for the  consolidation  of all significant  majority-owned  investments.
Therefore,  the financial  statements of these majority owned entities have been
consolidated  with the financial  statements of the  Partnership's and have been
restated for fiscal years 1995, 1996 and 1997 to reflect the  consolidation  and
related minority interests of $216,000 for Remington and Sun City as of December
31, 1996 and $227,000 at March 31, 1997.


In November,  1996, the Partnership entered into a non-interest bearing note for
$286,000. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  the note
should have been discounted at the date of execution and interest  accreted over
the period of the note for $127,000.  The consolidated financial statements have
been restated for this discount and accretion of interest.

ITEM 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations



TMP Land Mortgage  Fund,  Ltd., is a California  Limited  Partnership  formed in
April 1992, of which TMP Investments,  Inc., a California  corporation,  and TMP
Properties,  a California  general  partnership,  are the General  Partners (the
"General  Partners").  The Partnership was formed principally to make short-term
loans to  unaffiliated  parties  secured  by  first  trust  deeds on  unimproved
properties,  primarily in the Inland Empire area of Southern  California  and in
some  instances,  in other areas of  Southern  California,  and to provide  cash
distributions  to the Limited  Partners,  primarily from interest  earned on the
mortgage  loans.  The  Partnership  is not a mutual  fund or any  other  type of
investment  company  within the meaning  of, and is not  subject to  regulations
under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.


As of March 31, 1997, the Partnership had received and accepted subscriptions of
15,715  Units,  representing  total  subscription  proceeds  in  the  amount  of
$15,715,000.  All  proceeds  had been  committed  to the  twelve  mortgage  loan
investments  made by the  Partnership and to working  capital  reserves.  During
1992, the Partnership funded five mortgage loans. Four loans were funded in 1993
and three loans were funded in 1994.


As a consequence  of adverse  changes in market  conditions  and other  factors,
three of the loans  were  repaid  and nine of the loans  were  foreclosed  upon.
During the three months ended March 31, 1997, the following activity occurred on
the properties that the Partnership owns:



PR Equities Loan #1 and #2



The Partnership  foreclosed on the property that secured these loans during 1994
and now owns the property.  The current outstanding  payments due as a result of
the  Mello-Roos  tax  assessment  against the  Partnership's  lots taken back in
foreclosure  is  approximately  $3,000,000.  This debt,  plus the continuing tax
accrual  makes the property  unsaleable in the current real estate  market.  The
City of San Jacinto received the overall  appraisal of the properties in the CFD
during the first week of July.  The low land values  reflected in the  appraisal
confirmed the General  Partners'  opinion that the bonds should be restructured,
and the  overall  bonded  indebtedness  and the annual  debt  service  should be
reduced.


The city was forced by the terms of the bonds to schedule a sale of the property
for  delinquent  bond  assessments.  The buyer would be required to pay the full
unpaid assessment,  penalties, and interest as well as assume the full amount of
the remaining assessment. The sale occurred in April 1997 but there was no buyer
for the properties; therefore, the Partnership continues to own these parcels.


See  restatement  and  resissuance  of  financial  statements  in  Note 4 to the
Partnership's consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results
of Operations, Continued




Environmental Development Loan



The  Partnership  accepted  a deed in  lieu of  foreclosure  and  now  owns  the
property.  A joint venture with TMP Homes has been formed to build single family
homes on the 181 lots.  The plan  check  for the  final map and the  improvement
plans for Phase I and II are in process with the city.  Loan  packages have been
sent to three lenders, with Tokai Bank expressing a strong interest in providing
a construction loan.



Fox Olson Loan #2



Property  on  Newport  Avenue  west of the  Interstate  215 is now  owned by the
Partnership.  A joint  venture  with  TMP  Homes  has  been  formed  to build 45
single-family  homes.  The final map is ready to record and a construction  loan
for the project is currently being sought.



LaMonte Loan



The  Partnership  has  acquired  this  6.5  acre  commercial   property  through
foreclosure in April 1996. However,  the previous debtor is attempting,  through
litigation,  to set aside the foreclosure.  The bankruptcy  filing by the former
borrower has been withdrawn.


During the three months ended March 31, 1997,  net income was generated from the
Partnership's  share of profits  resulting from the sale of the Hollywood Studio
Club Apartments. There was no interest received on mortgage loans. Approximately
$1,000,000 was distributed to investors as a result of the property sale.


During the three months  ended March 31, 1996,  net income was derived from both
mortgage loan  interest and  investment  income from the  Hollywood  Studio Club
Apartments. No distributions were made to investors.  Distributions to investors
began August 1, 1992,  and  continued  monthly  through May 1, 1995.  On June 1,
1995,  the  General  Partners  suspended  distributions  due to the  default and
subsequent foreclosure on several of the mortgage loans.


Management  believes there is sufficient  cash to meet  anticipated  Partnership
cash needs for the next 12 months. However,  management does not plan to pay the
Mello-Roos  taxes  on  the  PR  Equities  properties  unless  the  bonds  can be
restructured under more favorable terms.


The  Partnership  will  maintain  reserves for working  capital and  contingency
reserves in an amount as the General  Partners deem  necessary for the operation
of the business of the  Partnership.  In  addition,  the  Partnership  may incur
indebtedness as necessary for development or other expenses  incurred in holding
the properties  and/or developing the property in conjunction with an affiliated
development  company.  The  Partnership is making every effort to develop and/or
sell all of the properties that it holds.

The Initial Decision finds these allegations to be true and revokes the registration of each class of the company’s registered securities, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

TMP LAND MORTGAGE FUND LTD - 10KSB - 19990614 - AUDITORS_OPINION





Report of Independent Auditors



To the Partners

TMP Land Mortgage Fund, Ltd.

(A California Limited Partnership)


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of TMP Land Mortgage
Fund, Ltd. (A California  Limited  Partnership) as of December 31, 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows
for the year then ended.  These financial  statements are the  responsibility of
the  Partnership's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of TMP Land Mortgage Fund, Ltd. (A
California Limited  Partnership) as of December 31, 1998, and the results of its
operations  and its cash  flows  for the year  then  ended  in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.


Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic  financial
statements taken as a whole. The supplementary information contained in Schedule
II is presented for purposes of  additional  analysis and is not a required part
of the basic financial  statements.  Such  information has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial  statements and,
in our opinion,  is stated  fairly in all  material  respects in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.


Other  auditors  examined the  financial  statements as of December 31, 1997. As
discussed in Note 4, those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on February
3, 1998,  and on May 15, 1999 reissued  their  unqualified  opinion for the year
ended December 31, 1997.

TMP LAND MORTGAGE FUND LTD - 10-K/A - 19990616 - NOTES_TO_FINANCIAL_STATEMENT




Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1995 and 1994



Note 1 -  General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



General - TMP Land Mortgage Fund,  Ltd., A California  Limited  Partnership (the
"Partnership"),  was organized in 1991 in accordance  with the provisions of the
California Uniform Limited Partnership Act. The purpose of the Partnership is to
make  short-term  (generally one to three-year)  loans to  unaffiliated  parties
secured by first trust deeds  (mortgages) on unimproved real property  primarily
in  the  Inland  Empire  area  of  Southern   California  and  to  provide  cash
distributions  on a  current  basis  to the  limited  partners,  primarily  from
interest earned on the mortgage loans.


Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated  financial statements include the
accounts  of the  Partnership  and its  majority-owned  investments,  TMP  Homes
Remington,  LLC (Remington) and TMP Homes  Flowerfield-Sun City, LLC (Sun City).
All significant  intercompany  accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. (See Note 7)


Investment in Unimproved  Land - Investment in unimproved  land is stated at the
balance of the  foreclosed  loan plus carrying and  improvement  costs  incurred
subsequent to foreclosure,  net of a valuation allowance, as necessary, to state
the properties at their fair value.  All costs  associated  with the acquisition
and  improvement  of a property are  capitalized  including all direct  carrying
costs; such as interest expense and property taxes.


Syndication Costs - Syndication costs (such as commissions,  printing, and legal
fees) were paid by an affiliate of the Partnership,  TMP Realty, Inc. (See Notes
2 and 6.)


Income  Taxes - No  provision  for  federal  income  taxes  has been made in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements as all profits and losses flow
through to the respective partners and are recognized on their individual income
tax  returns.  However,  the  minimum  California  franchise  tax  paid  by  the
Partnership  and it's  consolidated  entities at December  31, 1995 and 1994 was
$800 per year.


Cash and Cash Equivalents - For purposes of the Consolidated  Statements of Cash
Flows, the Partnership  considers all highly liquid  investments with a maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  During the normal course of its
business,  the Partnership  accumulates  cash and maintains  deposits at various
banks.  Occasionally,  the cash  deposit  at a  particular  bank may  exceed the
federally insured limit. Any accounting loss or cash requirement  resulting from
the failure of a bank would be limited to such excess amounts.


Use of Estimates - In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  management  is  required  to  make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities as of the
date of the financial  statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.


Concentration  - All  unimproved  land  parcels held for sale are located in the
Inland  Empire  area of Southern  California.  The  eventual  sales price of all
parcels  is  highly  dependent  on  the  real  estate  market  conditions.   The
Partnership  attempts to mitigate any potential  risk by  monitoring  the market
condition and holding the land parcels until the real estate market recovers.

The  general  partners  manage  and  control  the  affairs  of the  Partnership,
including  final  approval  of all  loans  and  investments,  and have  ultimate
authority  for  matters   affecting  the  interests  of  the  Partnership.   All
organization  and offering  expenses of the Partnership were paid by TMP Realty,
an affiliate of the general  partners,  in exchange for loan fees (or points) on
each mortgage loan.


The  partnership  agreement  provides for two types of  investments:  Individual
Retirement  Accounts (IRA) and others. The IRA minimum purchase  requirement was
$2,000 and all others were a minimum purchase requirement of $5,000. The maximum
liability of the limited partners is the amount of their capital contribution.



Note 3 - Partners' Contributions



The Partnership  raised capital through a public offering of units at $1,000 per
unit.  The  minimum  offering  size was 1,000 units or  $1,000,000.  The maximum
offering  size was 20,000 units or  $20,000,000.  As of April 21,  1994,  15,715
units were sold for total capital  contributions of $15,715,000 and the offering
was closed.



Note 4 - Allocation of Profits and Losses and Cash Distributions



Profit,  losses, and cash distributions are allocated ninety-nine percent to the
limited  partners  and one  percent to the  general  partners  until the limited
partners  have received an amount equal to their  capital  contributions  plus a
cumulative,  non-compounded  return of eight  percent  per annum  based on their
adjusted capital account balances, at which time, remaining profits,  losses and
cash distributions are allocated seventy-six percent to the limited partners and
twenty-four  percent  to  the  general  partners.  Distributions  of  cash  from
operations,  if any, are made monthly within 30 days after the end of the month.
Distributions  made  during  1995,  1994 and 1993 are shown on the  accompanying
consolidated statements of partners' capital.

During 1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively,  the Partnership was charged $17,624,
$21,381, and $32,791,  respectively,  (of which $0, $869, and $3,345 is included

borrowed  $201,875 from TMP Properties to fund mortgage  loans.  The Partnership
repaid the loans, with interest of $890, during 1993.



Note 6 - Mortgage loans on real estate



The loan agreements require borrowers to place funds from the loan proceeds in a
restricted  bank account equal to the total  interest  payments over the term of
the loan.


The Partnership receives a first security interest in said account as additional
collateral for the payment of the note.  The borrowers  instruct the bank to pay
to the Partnership the amount of the monthly loan payment.  In view of this, the
only  accrual of interest on the loans is for the portion of each month the loan
is earning  interest  until the first of the following  month when the funds are
released from the restricted account.


In the event of foreclosure,  the collateral would be recorded at its fair value
at the  time of  foreclosure,  less  costs  of  disposal.  Fair  value  would be
considered to be the lower of (a) appraised  value  determined by an independent
real estate appraiser,  or (b) the General Partners'  determination of the value
of the property based on their analysis.


The Partnership would consider collateral for a loan in substance  foreclosed if
all of the following criteria are met:


1. The  borrower  has  little or no equity in the  collateral,  considering  the
current fair value of the collateral; and


2. Proceeds  for  repayment  of  the loan can be  expected to come only from the
operation or sale of the collateral; and


3. The borrower has either:

a) formally or effectively  abandoned  control  of  the  collateral  to   the
Partnership, or


b) retained  control    of   the  collateral  but,  because  of  the  current
financial  condition  of  the  borrower,  or  the economic   prospects for
the borrower and/or  the  collateral in  the  foreseeable  future,  it  is
doubtful  that  the   borrower   will  be  able to  rebuild  equity in the
collateral or otherwise repay the loan in the foreseeable future.


If this  occurred,  the collateral  would be considered  foreclosed and would be
recorded at its fair value.


The PR Equities loans for $2,400,000 and $1,150,000 matured January 14, 1994 and
May 30, 1994,  went into default and were  foreclosed on June 2, 1994 and August
11, 1994,  respectively.  The collateral  (land) was recorded in the accounts of
the Partnership at the gross loan amounts, less a valuation allowance, to record
the net book  value of the  land at its fair  value at the date of  foreclosure.

(See Note 7)


The Sunset  Crossing  loan for  $1,875,000  matured  August 27, 1994,  went into
default and was  foreclosed  on December 21,  1994.  The  collateral  (land) was
recorded in the  accounts at the loan  amount and unpaid  property  taxes at the
time of foreclosure, which approximated the fair value of the land.


The Olson loan for $1,320,000  matured June 24, 1994,  went into default and was
foreclosed  on  November  2, 1994.  The  collateral  (land) was  recorded in the
accounts at the loan amount, which approximated the fair value of the land.

fraudulent transfer of the property to an insolvent corporation.


The  Rockfield  Development  loan for  $100,000  defaulted on April 13, 1995 and
foreclosure  was  completed on  January17,  1996.  The  Patnership  acquired the
collateral  (land)  sunsequent to December 31, 1995.  The  Partnership  is a 40%
owner of the property  and the  remainint  60% is owned by TMP  Mortgage  Income
Plus, Ltd.


The Peppertree loan for $2,000,000  which matured on June 28, 1995 is on a month
to month extension as of December 31, 1995.



Note 7 - Restatements and reissuances of 1994 and 1995 Financial Statements



In 1992,  the  Partnership  made two loans  totaling  $3,500,000 to PR Equities,
Ltd., a California  Limited  Partnership.  The loans were secured by first trust
deeds on residential property located in San Jacinto,  California.  In 1994, the
Partnership  foreclosed on the properties  securing these loans and continues to
own  these  properties.   In  accordance  with  generally  accepted   accounting
principles,  assets acquired through foreclosure should be recorded at the lower
of cost or fair value less costs of  disposal  at the date of  foreclosure.  The
1994-1995 financial  statements  originally issued reported this property at the
amount of the  outstanding  mortgage  balances due on these loans at the time of
foreclosure,  which did not  represent  their fair value less costs of disposal.
Management  has  subsequently  determined  that a valuation  allowance for these
properties  should have been established for  approximately  $3.8 million at the
date of foreclosure in 1994. The valuation  allowance  should have been adjusted
each year  thereafter  such that the only  value  for  these  properties  is the
capitalized direct carrying costs that represent the total accumulated  property
taxes and Mello-Roos bond  assessments.  Therefore,  the consolidated  financial
statements  for 1994  and 1995  have  been  restated  to  record  the  valuation
allowance and to adjust these properties to their fair value for those years.


In addition, management has determined that the amount of property taxes payable
as recorded in June,  1994, and subsequent  periods  through  December 31, 1995,
were  understated  by a total of $1.3 million .  Accordingly,  the  consolidated
financial   statements   for  those   periods   have  been   restated  for  this
understatement  by  adjusting  the  carrying  value of the land and the property
taxes payable in the appropriate fiscal years.


In accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  the financial
statements of  majority-owned  investments are required to be consolidated.  The
1995 financial  statements  originally  issued did not properly  account for the
consolidation  of all significant  majority-owned  investments.  Therefore,  the
financial  statements  of these  material  majority  owned  entities  have  been
consolidated  with the financial  statements of the  Partnership's and have been
restated for fiscal year 1995 to reflect the  consolidation and related minority
interests of $35,000 for Remington and Sun City as of December 31, 1995.

Construction, Lot & Land Loans: What Type of Loan Do You Need?
Share this post:Buying land and building a new home can be an exciting experience, and if you plan to get financing you need to understand your options related to lot loans, land loans and construction loans.
What kind of loan is right for you? Even though it may seem obvious, this question does not always have a clear answer and the subject often is misunderstood by potential borrowers. It’s important to understand that these loans have unique characteristics and the lending options that are available for you will depend on factors like your personal situation, the type of property you are buying, your level of preparation and your timing for building a home. This article will provide an overview of (a) Lot and Land Loans, and (b) Home Construction Loans, to help you consider what fits your needs. A related article in this series goes into more detail about the terms for lot and land loans and another describes the terms for construction loans.

These Loans Are Different
Most homeowners are familiar with the typical mortgage loan used to finance the purchase of an existing, already-built home (referred to by some as a “purchase money” mortgage or loan). Purchase money loans are the standard of the residential lending industry, and entire financial markets, mortgage products and automated systems have been created to make these loans efficient and easy for banks to underwrite and process.
But conventional purchase money mortgages are different from lot, land and construction loans – both in how they are structured and how lenders underwrite, process and account for them – and understanding these differences is perhaps the most important takeaway that potential borrowers need to grasp before seeking a loan for buying land or building a home.  Read about why banks treat these loans differently.
A fundamental basis for this difference is that, before providing financing for your purchase of vacant land or a construction loan to build your home, a bank needs to understand your plans for the property. The purpose and timing for a purchase money loan is known and obvious – you’re buying an existing home of a certain value at your closing – but there is more uncertainty about the facts, valuation and what the future holds when working with a vacant land loan or a construction loan. Details about the property and your overall story will influence the perceived risk to the lender and help the lender decide whether it will approve your loan. For this reason, land loans and construction loans are often referred to as “story loans.”
Loans to Buy Vacant Land or a Lot
Ready to buy a homesite, but not quite ready to build your new home? Many buyers are looking for – or already have found – the ideal lot or vacant property for building their future home, but need to wait before they start construction. Life and financial situations (job, children, selling an existing home) can play a big part in whether someone is ready to start building a home from the ground up, and for some the time is not right to take on the task. If that is your situation, you likely will want to consider some form of “lot loan” or “land loan” to make your vacant property purchase first.  And later, when you’re actually ready to build a home on your lot, you can consider your construction loan options.
A lot or land loan allows you to secure your ideal homesite so you can continue to get ready to build your home. Borrowers can use the time after they close to plan their new home and its design. If they haven’t partnered with anyone yet, then some will use this time period to find their ideal home builder. And maybe this time allows you to settle into a new job or your children to graduate from college.
From a borrower’s perspective, lot and land loans are both harder to find and have less favorable terms than a conventional purchase money mortgage for a home. Although lot and land loans are structured and documented similar to purchase money home loans, be prepared to see shorter-term loans, higher down payments, higher interest rates and additional borrower commitments and underwriting. We have discussed both lot and land loans together here, but some lenders have different loan terms and programs that distinguish between finished lots (ready-to-build, with utilities and roads) and undeveloped vacant land. Read more details about how lot and land loans work.
New Home Construction Loans
Ready to have your new home built right away?  If you have (or soon will have) all your ducks in a row – you’ve found your lot, finalized your house plans and are working with a builder – then a construction loan likely is what you’re ready for.
Construction loans typically fund the construction of custom or semi-custom homes from the ground up. When buying either a “Spec” home that already is built or when buying new homes from production builders, a buyer usually would not use a construction loan. In these transactions, if the builder is selling a completed home the borrower should only need a purchase money mortgage to buy the new home and the land on which it sits.

Home construction loans are unique products, and involve different paperwork, procedures and funding methods when compared to many other loan types. A significant difference is that home construction loans are short-term loans that are funded in periodic advances (or draws), so they are not fully funded at one time like at the loan closing for the purchase of a lot, land or existing home.
From a borrower’s perspective, and much like lot and land loans, construction loans usually are more difficult to obtain and will include less favorable financing terms when compared to a standard home mortgage. Be prepared to be faced with a larger amount of paperwork, additional transaction costs, a sizable down payment, a very short-term loan period and the possibility of higher interest rates (although monthly payments can be interest only during the construction phase). You likely will spend more of your time getting a construction loan processed and approved.
In the past, building a new home required two loans: the short-term construction loan for the construction phase and the long-term permanent mortgage (used to pay off the construction loan after the work was completed). This resulted in two closings, duplicate fees, high transaction costs and risks for the borrower about what happens when the construction loan matures.
Fortunately, the most common option today is the Construction-to-Permanent Loan (also called a “Single Closing” or “All-in-One” construction loan) that allows a borrower to have one loan, one closing and the construction loan simply converts to a long-term, permanent mortgage after the construction is completed.
Funds from a construction loan can help you build a home either on a lot you already own, or it can help finance the purchase of a new lot that you want to buy and then build on. If you already own your lot, your equity in the property can be included as part of the collateral for the construction loan. If you bought the land with a lot loan, then the construction loan typically would be used to payoff and refinance that first loan. If you are buying a lot with the construction loan you will coordinate the closing for the purchase of the lot with the construction loan closing.
Sometimes a homebuilder already owns lots and will offer to build a turnkey, finished home for a buyer on one of its lots. For builder-owned lots like this, the arrangement with the builder and the type of loan can vary. In some circumstances a buyer would need to get a construction loan up front, and buy the lot from the builder at the construction loan closing. But in other cases a builder with a builder-owned lot may fund the work and the buyer uses a purchase money mortgage to buy the home from the builder after the residence is completed.
If you are ready to start building your new home from the ground up it is likely that a construction loan is what you will need – whether or not you already own your lot free and clear, you bought your lot with a land loan or you are buying your lot with the construction loan. Read more details about how home construction loans work.
Finding a Lender & Related Considerations
The economic downturn and crash of the housing market continues to affect the availability of financing. Indeed, the market for purchase money mortgages for buying new homes – the typical, conventional mortgage – still is in flux and continues to make it difficult for many buyers of existing homes to get loans. These difficulties are amplified for the non-conventional lot loans, land loans and construction loans and this type of financing may not even be available in some markets. But the housing and lending markets steadily have been improving and these issues will continue to work themselves out as time goes on.
If you are ready to move forward with obtaining financing, then test the waters and see what options you will have. It goes without saying that you should make sure your financial house is in order so that you can make your loan look attractive to lenders.
Early in the process you should try to find a lender or mortgage broker that understands your needs and has experience in the type of loan that you are seeking. Getting pre-qualified will help you understand your budget and other financial limitations. Not all lenders or mortgage brokers work with loans for vacant land, so make sure you are partnering with someone who has the expertise, network and resources to deliver.
If working directly with a lender, be aware that it may be more difficult to get these kinds of loans from big banks. Consider working with a local community bank or credit union that may be more willing to fund these types of loans for properties in their area. Evaluate other lending options too, like VA Loans that can be used for new home construction or lot purchases, as well as potential local and state government-managed lending programs.
An experienced mortgage broker may have more loan options than a regular bank since they usually work with dozens of lending institutions across the country. Because of their variety of lending sources, a mortgage broker often can get you a better loan deal than if you contacted your local bank directly.
If you are unable to get a loan from a traditional lender, mortgage broker or government program, consider alternative strategies. Some borrowers look to cash, loans from family members and home equity loans from their existing residence to fund the purchase of a lot. Seller financing is another attractive possibility, as many motivated land sellers may be willing to allow you to finance your purchase with them instead of making you come up with the full price at the time of the purchase. Some borrowers try to sell their existing home first and then rent a home so that they can more easily afford a lot purchase loan or construction loan.
 
Whether you are considering a loan to purchase a lot, a loan to buy vacant land or a construction loan for building your new home on a lot of your choosing, hopefully this article will help you understand your options.  And if you’re ready to find the right lot or vacant land for you, LotNetwork.com has over 250,000 lot and land listings nationwide that you can search to find that property.

A good article. The issue of financing for the lot/land and home construction loans is may related to the issue of politics. Globally, if people shift from the living in the built-in house to a own-built home then the issue of industry and the employment will emerge which will eventually touch the topic of the power structure in a society. The agenda is very complex but I think that afterall the house with a substantial area of field for farming will gain the popularity.

AmCap proudly sponsored Green Eco Builders during the latest Circuit of the Americas race in Austin, Texas. A 16-hour race (eight on Saturday, eight on Sunday), it was both a challenge and a thrill. Green Eco Builders finished 3rd on Saturday despite colliding with a spinning car in front of their race car. The damage to the car was so severe, driver changes had to occur through the car window, due to the door being smashed shut. “We were running well mid-way through Sunday, when we blew out our motor,” said George Kopecky, founder of Green Eco Builders. “Oh well, that’s racing!”
