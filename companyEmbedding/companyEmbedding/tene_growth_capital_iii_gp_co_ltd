executive officers of Tene III. The sole director of Tene III is Dr. Halperin.  Dr. Halperin is also a major shareholder of Tene
III, which is the general partner of Tene III Projects, which is the general partner of the Record Holder. Dr. Halperin is presently the Senior Managing Partner of a group of investment funds under the name of Tene, located at 4 Berkowitz
Street, Museum Tower, 11th Floor, Tel Aviv, Israel 64238.  During the last five
years, none of the Reporting Persons (i) has been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) was a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent
jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with
respect to such laws.      CUSIP No. M 20598 104   13D   Page 6 of 11 Pages  Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration The Reporting Persons purchased the
Ordinary Shares reported herein with a combination of cash on hand and a bank loan, which was made in the ordinary course of business by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The total funds borrowed under
the bank loan to acquire the Ordinary Shares was $25 million. See Item 4 of this Schedule 13D for a description of the amount of funds used and the method of acquisition.    Item 4. Purpose of Transaction The Reporting Persons acquired the securities described in this
Schedule 13D for investment purposes and they intend to review their investments in the Issuer on a continuing basis. Any actions the Reporting Persons might undertake may be made at any time and from time to time without prior notice and will be
dependent upon the Reporting Persons review of numerous factors, including, but not limited to: an ongoing evaluation of the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects; price levels of the Issuers securities;
general market, industry and economic conditions; the relative attractiveness of alternative business and investment opportunities; and other future developments.  The Reporting Persons may acquire additional securities of the Issuer, or retain or sell all or a portion of the securities then held, in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In addition, the Reporting Persons may engage in discussions with management, the board of directors, and shareholders of the Issuer and other relevant parties or encourage, cause or seek to cause
the Issuer or such persons to consider or explore extraordinary corporate transactions, such as: a merger, reorganization or take-private transaction that could result in the de-listing or de-registration of the Ordinary Shares; sales or
acquisitions of assets or businesses; changes to the capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; or other material changes to the Issuers business or corporate structure, including changes in management or the composition of the
Issuers board of directors.  The Share Purchase and the Call Option  On September 9, 2016 (the Closing Date), pursuant to a term sheet dated September 5, 2016 (the Term
Sheet) between the Record Holder and Mifalei Sdot Yam, Agricultural Cooperative Society Ltd. (Sdot Yam), which is indirectly wholly owned by Kibbutz Sdot Yam, Agricultural Cooperative Society:  (i) the Record Holder purchased 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares from Sdot Yam for cash consideration in NIS at the last known
representative rate of exchange equal to a price per Ordinary Share of US$43.50 (the Share Price), such that the total consideration paid to the Kibbutz on the Closing Date was an amount of US$ 43,500,000; and  (ii) Sdot Yam granted the Record Holder a call option (the Call Option), conferring upon the Record Holder
for a period of five years thereafter (the Term), the right to purchase from Sdot Yam, at any time during the Term, up to 2,000,000 Ordinary Shares (the Option Shares) at the Exercise Price (as defined below).
 The purchase price per Ordinary Share for the Option Shares (the Exercise Price) is an amount paid in NIS, equal to US
$43, based on the known representative rate of exchange of the New Israeli Shekel to the US dollar, as determined at the end of the business day immediately preceding the date of the notice of exercise of the Call Option, with the addition of
accrued interest (compound interest), which shall be calculated as      CUSIP No. M 20598 104   13D   Page 7 of 11 Pages  
follows: (1) during the first four years following the Closing Date - annual interest at the rate of 3% per year; and (2) during the fifth year after the Closing Date - annual
interest at the rate of 3.5%. The above-referenced accrued interest will be calculated for the period between the Closing Date and each applicable date of notice of exercise of the Call Option (the Exercise Date), whereby once a
year the amount of yearly interest accrued until such date shall be added to the Exercise Price (the Exercise Price with the addition of the accrued interest thereon shall be referred to as the New Exercise Price), and such New
Exercise Price shall continue to bear such yearly accrued interest thereon, and so on until each applicable Exercise Date of the Option Shares. The Exercise Price will be adjusted for dividends, such that the New Exercise Price (as calculated on the
day of an applicable distribution of dividend) will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of dividend per share that will be distributed, and such reduced amount shall continue to bear the above-mentioned interest until the Exercise Date.  The Shareholders Agreement  Under the Term Sheet, the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agreed to provisions governing voting of each partys Ordinary Shares during the Term
(the Shareholders Agreement), pursuant to which:      1. the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree to vote at general meetings of the shareholders of the Issuer (each, a General Meeting) in the same manner, following discussions intended to reach an agreement on
any matters proposed to be voted upon, with the Record Holder determining the manner in which both parties shall vote if no agreement is reached, except with respect to certain carved-out matters, with respect to which, Sdot Yam will determine the
manner in which both parties shall vote if no agreement is reached. Notwithstanding the foregoing each of the Record Holder and Sdot Yam is entitled to instruct the other party to oppose to any resolution relating to a merger or transaction, the
result of which would transform the Issuer into a private company, in which case, both parties will vote against the adoption of such resolution.     2. the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree to use their best efforts, in their capacity as shareholders, to prevent any dilutive transactions that would reduce Sdot Yams holdings in the Issuer below 26% on a fully
diluted basis, provided that such agreement shall not apply as of the date on which the percentage of the Sdot Yams holdings decreases below 26% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Issuer, on a fully diluted basis, for any reason
whatsoever, or if Sdot Yam receives a satisfactory written certification from the Israel Land Authority permitting Sdot Yams holdings in the Issuer to decrease below 26%;     3.  the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree to exercise their best efforts, in their capacity as shareholders, in a
manner intended to cause that at least four (4) directors on behalf of the parties shall be elected to the Issuers board of directors, provided that the parties will not propose a resolution at the general meeting that will
contradict a recommendation of the Issuers board of directors to the shareholders in respect of this matter, and that the parties will obtain the support of other leading shareholders to such proposal.
    CUSIP No. M 20598 104   13D   Page 8 of 11 Pages    
Without derogating from the foregoing, the parties undertake to vote in favor of: (a) the appointment of one (1) director to the Board whose identity will be determined by Sdot Yam; and
(b) the appointment of two (2) directors to Board whose identity will be determined by the Record Holder. To the extent four (4) directors are elected on behalf of the parties to the Board, the parties will vote in favor of the
appointment of an additional director whose identity will be determined by Sdot Yam, but the appointment of such additional director will require the consent of the Record Holder;     4. the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree that as of the Closing Date and until the convening of a General Meeting for the purpose of implementing changes in the composition of the Board, Sdot Yam will cause two
(2) directors appointed on the its behalf to the Board to be replaced by two (2) directors whose identity will be determined by the Record Holder, by appointing them as alternate directors pursuant to the provisions of applicable law and
the articles of association of the Issuer;     5. subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Term Sheet, Sdot Yam agrees to continue to hold at least 6,850,000 Ordinary Shares of the Issuer at all times prior to expiration of the Term, and in no case fewer than the
number of Ordinary Shares that would permit the Record Holder to exercise the Call Option in full;     6. the Record Holder shall have a tag-along right and a right-of-first-offer with respect to any disposition of Ordinary Shares by Sdot Yam, other than Ordinary Shares sold by Sdot Yam pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933, which sale shall not be subject to the Issuers tag-along right or right-of-first-offer, but shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Item 5 above;     7. Sdot Yam shall have a tag-along right with respect to any disposition of Ordinary Shares by the Record Holder, to be exercised at a ratio of 1:1 in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares actually disposed of by the
Record Holder, which right shall not apply to a sale of shares as part of current trading on the stock exchange;     8. upon expiration of the Shareholders Agreement, the Record Holder agrees to take measures to replace directors who were appointed on its behalf to the Board, with directors whose identity will be determined by Sdot
Yam, by appointing them as alternate directors pursuant to the provisions of applicable law and the articles of association of the Issuer; and     9. in any case in which, as a result of the proposed action, the percentage of Sdot Yams holdings will be diluted by more than an accumulated rate of 25% compared with its holdings on the date of Closing, Sdot Yam
may direct the Record Holder to vote against the proposed action. On the Closing Date and as of the date of this
Schedule 13D, the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner had not yet approved the transactions described in this Schedule 13D. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, the Record Holder and Sdot Yam are prohibited from collectively voting more than 25% of the
issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Issuer (as measured on the date of such vote) until receipt of such approval from the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner.  The Registration Rights Agreement  In accordance with the Term Sheet and the purchase of the Purchased Shares and the Option Shares, as applicable, Sdot Yam agrees to assign to
the Record Holder certain rights under Section 3 and Section 5 of the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) associated with the Purchased Shares, and those same rights associated with any exercised Option Shares (following exercise
thereof), that Sdot Yam holds pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement dated July 21, 2011, as amended on February 13, 2012 (the Registration Rights Agreement), in accordance with the provisions governing such
transfer and assignment under Section 16 of the Registration Rights Agreement.      CUSIP No. M 20598 104   13D   Page 9 of 11 Pages  
Sdot Yam has not agreed to assign to the Record Holder its right to demand registration of shares under the Registration Rights Agreement (the Demand Registration Right),
though the Record Holder will be entitled to participate in any public offering of shares made by Sdot Yam in reliance on a registration statement filed by the Issuer in accordance with Sdot Yams exercise of the Demand Registration Right.  The foregoing descriptions of the Term Sheet and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements filed as exhibits to this Schedule 13D, and incorporated herein by reference.  Other than as described above, none of the Reporting Persons currently has any plans or proposals that relate to, or would result in, any of
the matters listed in Items 4(a)(j) of Schedule 13D, although, depending on the factors discussed herein, the Reporting Persons may change their purpose or formulate different plans or proposals with respect thereto at any time.    Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer (a)  (b) The following sets forth, as of the date of this Schedule 13D, the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares and percentage of Ordinary Shares
beneficially owned by each of the Reporting Persons, as well as the number of shares of Ordinary Shares as to which each Reporting Person has the sole power to vote or to direct the vote, shared power to vote or to direct the vote, sole power to

partner of Tene III Projects, which is the general partner of the Record Holder. As such, each of them may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the Ordinary Shares held of record by the Record Holder. Each such entity or person disclaims any

Item 3.
Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration  The Reporting Persons purchased the
Ordinary Shares reported herein with a combination of cash on hand and a bank loan, which was made in the ordinary course of business by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The total funds borrowed under
the bank loan to acquire the Ordinary Shares was $25 million. See Item 4 of this Schedule 13D for a description of the amount of funds used and the method of acquisition. 
 


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction  The Reporting Persons acquired the securities described in this
Schedule 13D for investment purposes and they intend to review their investments in the Issuer on a continuing basis. Any actions the Reporting Persons might undertake may be made at any time and from time to time without prior notice and will be
dependent upon the Reporting Persons review of numerous factors, including, but not limited to: an ongoing evaluation of the Issuers business, financial condition, operations and prospects; price levels of the Issuers securities;
general market, industry and economic conditions; the relative attractiveness of alternative business and investment opportunities; and other future developments. 
The Reporting Persons may acquire additional securities of the Issuer, or retain or sell all or a portion of the securities then held, in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In addition, the Reporting Persons may engage in discussions with management, the board of directors, and shareholders of the Issuer and other relevant parties or encourage, cause or seek to cause
the Issuer or such persons to consider or explore extraordinary corporate transactions, such as: a merger, reorganization or take-private transaction that could result in the de-listing or de-registration of the Ordinary Shares; sales or
acquisitions of assets or businesses; changes to the capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; or other material changes to the Issuers business or corporate structure, including changes in management or the composition of the
Issuers board of directors.  The Share Purchase and the Call Option 
On September 9, 2016 (the Closing Date), pursuant to a term sheet dated September 5, 2016 (the Term
Sheet) between the Record Holder and Mifalei Sdot Yam, Agricultural Cooperative Society Ltd. (Sdot Yam), which is indirectly wholly owned by Kibbutz Sdot Yam, Agricultural Cooperative Society: 
(i) the Record Holder purchased 1,000,000 Ordinary Shares from Sdot Yam for cash consideration in NIS at the last known
representative rate of exchange equal to a price per Ordinary Share of US$43.50 (the Share Price), such that the total consideration paid to the Kibbutz on the Closing Date was an amount of US$ 43,500,000; and 
(ii) Sdot Yam granted the Record Holder a call option (the Call Option), conferring upon the Record Holder
for a period of five years thereafter (the Term), the right to purchase from Sdot Yam, at any time during the Term, up to 2,000,000 Ordinary Shares (the Option Shares) at the Exercise Price (as defined below).
 The purchase price per Ordinary Share for the Option Shares (the Exercise Price) is an amount paid in NIS, equal to US
$43, based on the known representative rate of exchange of the New Israeli Shekel to the US dollar, as determined at the end of the business day immediately preceding the date of the notice of exercise of the Call Option, with the addition of
accrued interest (compound interest), which shall be calculated as 










CUSIP No. M 20598 104
 
13D
 
Page 7 of 11 Pages  

follows: (1) during the first four years following the Closing Date - annual interest at the rate of 3% per year; and (2) during the fifth year after the Closing Date - annual
interest at the rate of 3.5%. The above-referenced accrued interest will be calculated for the period between the Closing Date and each applicable date of notice of exercise of the Call Option (the Exercise Date), whereby once a
year the amount of yearly interest accrued until such date shall be added to the Exercise Price (the Exercise Price with the addition of the accrued interest thereon shall be referred to as the New Exercise Price), and such New
Exercise Price shall continue to bear such yearly accrued interest thereon, and so on until each applicable Exercise Date of the Option Shares. The Exercise Price will be adjusted for dividends, such that the New Exercise Price (as calculated on the
day of an applicable distribution of dividend) will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of dividend per share that will be distributed, and such reduced amount shall continue to bear the above-mentioned interest until the Exercise Date. 
The Shareholders Agreement 
Under the Term Sheet, the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agreed to provisions governing voting of each partys Ordinary Shares during the Term
(the Shareholders Agreement), pursuant to which:   


 
1.
the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree to vote at general meetings of the shareholders of the Issuer (each, a General Meeting) in the same manner, following discussions intended to reach an agreement on
any matters proposed to be voted upon, with the Record Holder determining the manner in which both parties shall vote if no agreement is reached, except with respect to certain carved-out matters, with respect to which, Sdot Yam will determine the
manner in which both parties shall vote if no agreement is reached. Notwithstanding the foregoing each of the Record Holder and Sdot Yam is entitled to instruct the other party to oppose to any resolution relating to a merger or transaction, the
result of which would transform the Issuer into a private company, in which case, both parties will vote against the adoption of such resolution.   


 
2.
the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree to use their best efforts, in their capacity as shareholders, to prevent any dilutive transactions that would reduce Sdot Yams holdings in the Issuer below 26% on a fully
diluted basis, provided that such agreement shall not apply as of the date on which the percentage of the Sdot Yams holdings decreases below 26% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Issuer, on a fully diluted basis, for any reason
whatsoever, or if Sdot Yam receives a satisfactory written certification from the Israel Land Authority permitting Sdot Yams holdings in the Issuer to decrease below 26%; 
 


 
3.
 the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree to exercise their best efforts, in their capacity as shareholders, in a
manner intended to cause that at least four (4) directors on behalf of the parties shall be elected to the Issuers board of directors, provided that the parties will not propose a resolution at the general meeting that will
contradict a recommendation of the Issuers board of directors to the shareholders in respect of this matter, and that the parties will obtain the support of other leading shareholders to such proposal.

13D
 
Page 8 of 11 Pages  


 

Without derogating from the foregoing, the parties undertake to vote in favor of: (a) the appointment of one (1) director to the Board whose identity will be determined by Sdot Yam; and
(b) the appointment of two (2) directors to Board whose identity will be determined by the Record Holder. To the extent four (4) directors are elected on behalf of the parties to the Board, the parties will vote in favor of the
appointment of an additional director whose identity will be determined by Sdot Yam, but the appointment of such additional director will require the consent of the Record Holder; 
 


 
4.
the Record Holder and Sdot Yam agree that as of the Closing Date and until the convening of a General Meeting for the purpose of implementing changes in the composition of the Board, Sdot Yam will cause two
(2) directors appointed on the its behalf to the Board to be replaced by two (2) directors whose identity will be determined by the Record Holder, by appointing them as alternate directors pursuant to the provisions of applicable law and
the articles of association of the Issuer;   


 
5.
subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Term Sheet, Sdot Yam agrees to continue to hold at least 6,850,000 Ordinary Shares of the Issuer at all times prior to expiration of the Term, and in no case fewer than the
number of Ordinary Shares that would permit the Record Holder to exercise the Call Option in full;   


 
6.
the Record Holder shall have a tag-along right and a right-of-first-offer with respect to any disposition of Ordinary Shares by Sdot Yam, other than Ordinary Shares sold by Sdot Yam pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933, which sale shall not be subject to the Issuers tag-along right or right-of-first-offer, but shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Item 5 above; 
 


 
7.
Sdot Yam shall have a tag-along right with respect to any disposition of Ordinary Shares by the Record Holder, to be exercised at a ratio of 1:1 in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares actually disposed of by the
Record Holder, which right shall not apply to a sale of shares as part of current trading on the stock exchange;   


 
8.
upon expiration of the Shareholders Agreement, the Record Holder agrees to take measures to replace directors who were appointed on its behalf to the Board, with directors whose identity will be determined by Sdot
Yam, by appointing them as alternate directors pursuant to the provisions of applicable law and the articles of association of the Issuer; and   


 
9.
in any case in which, as a result of the proposed action, the percentage of Sdot Yams holdings will be diluted by more than an accumulated rate of 25% compared with its holdings on the date of Closing, Sdot Yam
may direct the Record Holder to vote against the proposed action.  On the Closing Date and as of the date of this
Schedule 13D, the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner had not yet approved the transactions described in this Schedule 13D. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, the Record Holder and Sdot Yam are prohibited from collectively voting more than 25% of the
issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Issuer (as measured on the date of such vote) until receipt of such approval from the Israeli Antitrust Commissioner. 
The Registration Rights Agreement 
In accordance with the Term Sheet and the purchase of the Purchased Shares and the Option Shares, as applicable, Sdot Yam agrees to assign to
the Record Holder certain rights under Section 3 and Section 5 of the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) associated with the Purchased Shares, and those same rights associated with any exercised Option Shares (following exercise
thereof), that Sdot Yam holds pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement dated July 21, 2011, as amended on February 13, 2012 (the Registration Rights Agreement), in accordance with the provisions governing such
transfer and assignment under Section 16 of the Registration Rights Agreement. 










CUSIP No. M 20598 104
 
13D
 
Page 9 of 11 Pages  

Sdot Yam has not agreed to assign to the Record Holder its right to demand registration of shares under the Registration Rights Agreement (the Demand Registration Right),
though the Record Holder will be entitled to participate in any public offering of shares made by Sdot Yam in reliance on a registration statement filed by the Issuer in accordance with Sdot Yams exercise of the Demand Registration Right. 
The foregoing descriptions of the Term Sheet and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements filed as exhibits to this Schedule 13D, and incorporated herein by reference. 
Other than as described above, none of the Reporting Persons currently has any plans or proposals that relate to, or would result in, any of
the matters listed in Items 4(a)(j) of Schedule 13D, although, depending on the factors discussed herein, the Reporting Persons may change their purpose or formulate different plans or proposals with respect thereto at any time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
