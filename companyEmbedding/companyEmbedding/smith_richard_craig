@CraigSmith325is I really do believe that @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP want to recreate the Jim Crow laws, but for LGBT people.

Ex-Army Intelligence Officer Found Not Guilty on All Charges in Spy Trial - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→CounterspyEx-Army Intelligence Officer Found Not Guilty on All Charges in Spy TrialApril 12, 1986|Associated Press


ALEXANDRIA, Va. â Richard Craig Smith, the former Army intelligence officer who said he sold the Soviet Union information about U.S. counterspies as part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the KGB, was found not guilty on all charges at his espionage trial Friday.The jury of nine women and three men acquitted Smith on five counts--one of conspiracy, two of espionage and two of passing classified information to the Soviet Union. If convicted, he could have faced life imprisonment.The verdict was returned after about 5 1/2 hours of deliberations. Smith's wife, Susan, wept as it was read, as did several other members of his family, from Salt Lake City.The jury got the case after Smith's attorney, Brent Carruth, led them again through the defendant's complex account of being recruited and later betrayed by a renegade CIA team operating out of a business front in Honolulu.Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica said, however, that the betrayal was strictly Smith's. He said that the defendant, 42, fell deeper and deeper into debt after he resigned from the Army in 1980, and then resorted "to the one salable item he had," his knowledge of U.S. counterspy operations.Both sides acknowledged that Smith had met several times with a top KGB official, Victor Okunev, in late 1982 and early 1983, and was paid a total of $11,000.According to the defense, Smith was victimized by a CIA team headed by Charles Richardson, a high-ranking agency official who sometimes used the alias Richard P. Cavannaugh.Richardson confirmed during the trial that he left the agency under a cloud--he called it "involuntary retirement"--in 1984 because he exercised "poor judgment" in his dealings with a now-defunct Honolulu investment firm owned by Ronald Rewald.

Accused Spy Tells of U.S. Plot


UPI


Published: May 14, 1984









WASHINGTON, May 13— 
                    Richard Craig Smith, an accused spy, says he passed American military secrets to a K.G.B. officer in Japan as part of a clandestine operation by the Central Intelligence Agency to infiltrate Soviet intelligence.        

                    Mr. Smith, a former Army counterintelligence specialist, was arrested April 4 by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of disclosing the identities of six American double agents to Viktor I. Okunev for $11,000 in two meetings in Tokyo last year and in 1982.        

                    He was released on $500,000 bond last week and faces trial July 9 in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va.        

                    In an interview published today in The Washington Post, Mr. Smith, a 40- year-old native of Bellevue, Wash., said he was instructed by the C.I.A. to pose as an American businessman with terminal cancer who would ''sell anything,'' including military secrets, to put aside a nest egg for his family.        

                    ''That gave me a motivation for being willing to say something I probably shouldn't say and it also allowed the C.I.A. to put me in and establish the contact and then take me out very quickly - I'd just get sick,'' Mr. Smith said in an interview last week conducted with his attorneys present.        

                    The Post's article said the C.I.A. refused to comment on Mr. Smith's statements. But Joseph Aronica, an Assistant United States Attorney who is prosecuting the case, said: ''The Justice Department doesn't move forward on a case of this nature unless there is full consultation.''

Keep in mind Trump has been obsessed with nukes since 1984 and has said "If we have them, why not use them?"

He'd do it. And they'd comply. https://twitter.com/nytpolitics/status/890610273412718593 …
