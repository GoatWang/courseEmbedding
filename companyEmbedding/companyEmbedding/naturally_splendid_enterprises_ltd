Vision


To be a leading provider of high quality plant-based functional foods and ingredients giving value to our customers, guided by sustainable principles. 

Enhancing health, lifestyle and the quality of life. 






8000 BCE
The first known existence of hemp in Taiwan is recorded. Hemp rope on pottery is dated back to before 8000 BCE.




6000-2000 BCE
Hemp is first used as food in China in 6000 BCE, for construction of the pyramids in Egypt in 3500 BCE and first recorded to be medicinally used as a health product by Emperor Shen Neng of China in 2737 BCE.




100-600s
Hemp is used in the construction of many roman style arch bridges, many of which stand to this day throughout France, Italy and Greece.




1600 - 1800s
Hemp is widely used for paper, textiles, rope, construction material and canvas for painting around the world. The US becomes a leading agricultural producer of hemp in the 1800s.




1930s
The US Congress Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 inhibits the growth of the hemp agricultural industry for textiles, food and construction material due to the new heavy taxation system which is lobbied to help increase the synthetic fiber industry. In the 1940s the criminalization of Marijuana, a close relative to industrial hemp seed Canabis Sativa L., began resulting in the ban on grown industrial hemp seed due to association.




1990s
The Canadian Government legalizes growing industrial hemp seed, a once thriving agricultural sector that has been on a  30+ year hiatus is reborn. The hemp movement is rejuvenated within Canadian Agricultural economy once again. Naturally Splendid’s newly acquired CHII Naturally Pure Hemp is incorporated in May 1998.




2010s
Naturally Splendid Enterprises is founded and subsequently launches their 4 retail brands and 4 biotech divisions in the next few years. In 2015 the company shows its biggest increase in stock value as it exemplifies rapid climb as a leader within its industry.




2016
Naturally Splendid undergoes a re-brand and re-launch of its brands division including the launch of a new marketing initiative for its online platforms. Innovative progress is continued to be made in its innovative bioactive ingredients as well as partnerships for HempOmega and CBD distribution within the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Large global hemp distribution deals are formalized from a new partnership in South Korea.

Our response was to apply advanced technology and science to hemp, and build a company that provides consumers, manufacturers and retailers access to high quality hemp products.  We wanted to build a company that brings hemp to the forefront of health, innovation and bio pharmaceuticals. Naturally Splendid has achieved this through consumer facing retails brands, scientific hemp breakthroughs with HempOmega, fulfilling wholesale plant based ingredients and applying science to the medicinal CBD industry.  Most importantly, our goal was to create products that people love, benefit from and are good for the environment.

NSE’s vision is to enhance the health, lifestyle and the quality of life of our customers by developing and delivering products that promote these fundamental beliefs. Guided by sustainable principles, our mission is to be a leading provider of high quality plant-based functional foods and ingredients giving value to our customers. NSE has built a solid foundation and assembled a team that I’m honored to be a part of.

AGM          


News & Media          



Naturally Splendid® Enterprises is a “superfood” company focused on providing products for men women and children that offer functional benefits beyond basic nutrition. Our target markets are people who want to take more control over
their health by consuming healthy, nutritious, good tasting foods as part of a balanced diet.
Naturally Splendid® Enterprises has chosen hemp and hemp derivatives as our core product. Hemp has an unparalleled ingredient composition which includes protein, omega, fibre, minerals and vitamins. It is our view that the growth potential
for hemp food products will surpass all other ingredient supplements on a global basis.
Naturally Splendid® Enterprises is the first publicly traded hemp food company in the world. Our plans include a product line expansion based on hemp ingredients as well as the inclusion of other “superfoods” identified and in demand
by a growing segment of consumers.
Government Support
Naturally Splendid® has received federal and provincial funding towards the research and development of new value added hemp-based food products as well as for a vertical integration feasibility study. Success with these projects may open the door for
further government funding and support. The hemp sector in particular has been the recipient of numerous grants and loan programs as both federal and provincial governments learn about and support initiatives targeted at discovery and expansion.
The Company has received financial support from the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). The funding will assist with the cost of product development on a proprietary, delivery system for hemp-oil Omega
products.
Nature’s “Perfect Food”
Hemp has the most digestible protein of any member of the plant kingdom, the perfect balance of omega-­-3 and omega-­-6, is rich in chlorophyll and the green plant phytonutrients found in the best green leafy vegetables, low in carbs/sugars and
high in fibre. It offers more balanced nutritional value in one small “package” than any other cultivated crop on earth.
Rising Demand for Healthy Foods
In a world filled with people dealing with cardiovascular diseases, inflammation and obesity there is an ever increasing number of consumers attempting to manage and prevent a variety of health issues through a healthier diet.
On March 1 2012, ten thousand Baby Boomers turned 65. Ten thousand more turned 65 the next day… and ten thousand more will turn 65 every day for the next 18 years.
Retail sales of natural and organic foods are growing over 4 times faster than conventional groceries.
Growing Product Niche
Canadian companies in the functional foods and nutraceuticals industry – ranging from small startups to multinationals – generate an estimated $4 billion in revenues annually.
Major grocery retailers are becoming more deeply committed to natural and organic products.
Experienced Management Team
Our team is comprised of experts in sales and marketing, financial and risk management, public markets, retail, agricultural production and marketing, business building and transportation.
Industry Partnerships
Research and Development
Strategic partnerships exist with government agencies including the federal agricultural support program Growing Forward 2, the National Research Council of Canada and Food Processing Development Centers. NSE has been successful in securing funding for
three projects to date and has developed strong lines of communication and understanding with arms of both the federal and provincial government agricultural departments. NSE has also partnered with private sector research companies to develop new value
added products and innovative product delivery mechanisms for our superfood lines. NSE also supports the activities of the Canadian hemp Trade Alliance as the single industry association dedicated to the growth and expansion of the hemp industry in
Canada.
Canada Brand Program
Naturally Splendid® was officially accepted into the Canada Brand Program in June of 2012. We are now eligible to post the Canada Brand logo as a 100% Canadian product on our packaging and marketing materials.
“Market research has proven that consumers associate the Canada Brand identifiers with safe, high-quality products…”
“Research shows that the maple leaf symbol is strongly associated with Canada and that Canada is associated with good things that food buyers value. 80% of consumers polled in a recent study claimed they would be more likely to buy a food product that
is clearly labeled as Canadian…”
“It is fair to conclude that promoting food products as Canadian in the domestic market will lead to an increase in sales for those products. And in some cases the increase in sales can be dramatic; 30% or more.” (http://www.eatcanadian.ca/6192-eng.htm)
Non-GMO Project Verification Program
Naturally Splendid® received acceptance in the Non-GMO Project Verification Program in September 2012 and has approval to post the Non GMO label on several of our current products.
Non-GMO certification of products is a significant driver for consumer buying trends:
“Polls consistently show that a significant majority of North Americans would like to be able to tell if the food they are purchasing contains GMOs (a 2008 CBS News Poll found that 87% of consumers wanted GMOs labeled). And, according to a recent CBS/New
York Times poll, 53% of consumers said they would not buy food that has been genetically modified.” (http://www.nongmoproject.org/learn-more/)
Corporate Responsibility
At Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd. (NSE), we believe in the power of innovation to create change. Our Corporate Responsibility commitment is to maintain morally sound policies, systems and procedures to ensure that our company is creating products and bio-technologies that have a positive impact on our consumers, the economy, and our environment.
Through our exploration of hemp, the world’s most multi-faceted plant, we will strive to uncover the broad spectrum of applications of which this plant is capable.  We will put the necessary measures in place to guarantee that our company has a positive impact on the world around us, and that we maintain the highest quality in our standards of ethical conduct.
Our efforts surrounding hemp are focused on the following areas where we believe we can have the most impact:

Nutritional Biotechnologies
Cannabinoid Pharmaceuticals and Nutraceuticals
Superfoods & Industrial Hemp

In all of these areas, NSE’s Management and Board of Directors have developed a set of corporate guidelines to ensure that necessary measures are implemented to maintain our high standard of ethical conduct. These guidelines set out the principles by which Naturally Splendid is guided and describe the responsibilities it has towards its shareholders, employees, partners, local communities, and the environment.
Corporate Responsibility goes far beyond simply having these guidelines in place.  NSE has integrated these high values with our corporate culture so that they effectively echo in all echelons of the organization. Our commitment to Corporate Responsibility reaches from our workforce, to our senior management, to our research, to our market, and ultimately to our products and bio-technologies.

(TSX VENTURE:NSP)(50N.F) - The Company is pleased to announce the achievement of a significant milestone in the product development and scale up production of Boreal Technology's HempOmega™ and H2Omega™. Boreal has successfully completed the first pilot scale production run of HempOmega™. The success of this pilot scale production run enables Naturally Splendid the ability to offer commercial sized production quantities of HempOmega™ and H2Omega™. Naturally Splendid has exclusive rights to market Boreal's full range of plant based omega products throughout North America."This latest development signals our first foray into the ingredient market for Naturally Splendid" states CEO, Craig Goodwin. "Up to now our focus has been on our NATERA™ retail product, but this exciting announcement now means we can broaden our own retail product line to include this sophisticated technology as well as make it available to ingredient suppliers across North America. This is a very exciting and pivotal day for both companies."Naturally Splendid has begun the development of a retail plant-based omega line centered on the Boreal technology, which will compete in the lucrative omega nutrition market. This addition to the Company's existing line will be marketed and distributed through the distribution network, which includes internal sales, Purity Life (with a reach over 7,000 retail outlets) and Summit Specialty Foods (who service over 900 clients). In addition, Naturally Splendid will facilitate discussions between Boreal's scientists and the end use marketplace to begin customized product development utilizing Boreal's encapsulation process.The Products - Plant Based Omega NutritionThe products covered in the Exclusive Sales Agreement between the parties are HempOmega™, H2Omega™, FlaxOmega™, CanolaOmega™ and ChiaOmega™. These novel products utilize microencapsulation as well as liposomal formulation and will be available in both the powder format and an aqueous solution for increased flexibility with regard to ingredient applications and/or stand-alone products.The TechnologyDeveloped by Boreal, these proprietary omega formulations utilize both microencapsulation as well as liposomal formulation in the delivery process to the human digestive system. Preliminary testing has confirmed that these products offer increased bioavailability and sustainability by encapsulating lipids and transforming the insoluble ingredients into a stable aqueous suspension. The suspended particles can then be used in a liquid state or converted into a fine, flour-like, dry powder ingredient. This procedure allows for multiple methods of product implementation: capsules, powders, baked goods, beverages, etc. with precise control over formulation, dosage and uptake. This technology creates value-added ingredients and expands the market potential for oil-based substances which can prove challenging to formulate.The Nutrition MarketThe omega nutritional market is arguably the largest supplement market category in terms of dollars generated annually.According to Nutrition Business Journal data, raw material sales are hovering around the $250 million mark thus far in 2013.Packaged Facts puts the omega-3 products market at about $24.4 billion (EUR19 billion) in 2011.According to Packaged Facts, a 2010 Gallup study of nutrient knowledge and consumption found that in 2011, 34% of shoppers chose products because of their omega-3 content.Frost & Sullivan, a global growth consulting firm, believes the global omega-3 ingredient market grew to $1.89 billion in 2011, up from $1.68 billion in 2010. Double-digit growth is forecast from 2012 to 2016.According to Euromonitor International, the retail value sales of foods (including milk formula) and drinks with added omega fatty acids reached $30 billion in 2012.Sales of foods/beverages carrying an omega-3 claim reached $1.8 billion in U.S. supermarkets in 2011 (Nielsen, U.S. Healthy eating trends: part 1. Jan. 26. 2011.)In an Ipsos Reid survey conducted by BioAccess, Canadian respondents showed that a full 80% of Canadians are influenced to buy a product if it contains omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, the survey found that 45% of all Canadians have used, or are currently using, omega-3 fatty acids in a natural health product format. And in the U.S., the Hartman Group found that 52% of Americans stated that they are attempting to increase omega-3 ingredients in their diets.Read MoreCraig Goodwin, Naturally Splendid CEO summarizes, "Consumer demand for omega-3 fatty acids has increased substantially since 2005. In Canada alone, there has been a 1,766% growth in consumption of omega-3 natural health products since 2005 according to studies conducted by Ipsos-Reid. Naturally Splendid has the right product, for the right market at the perfect time".About Naturally Splendid Enterprises Ltd.Naturally Splendid's 100% owned NATERA™ line of hemp-based superfood products are carried nationwide by Canada's leading health food distributors and a network of retail stores across Canada including major retailers and specialty stores. Naturally Splendid's recently rebranded "NATERA™" line of products includes natural and flavored shelled hemp seeds as well as natural and flavored hemp protein powders.Naturally Splendid has an exclusive sales agreement to market and distribute, in North America, the full complement of patent pending, plant-based omega products created by Boreal Technologies. The products include HempOmega™ and H2Omega™, as well as the FlaxOmega™, CanolaOmega™, and ChiaOmega™ plant based omega products. These novel products utilize microencapsulation and liposome technologies and are available in both a powder format and an aqueous solution for increased flexibility in ingredient applications and stand-alone products.About Boreal Technologies Inc.Boreal Technologies Inc. ("Boreal") is a privately owned Canadian company located on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver, B.C. Boreal provides pilot manufacturing and process/product development for Omega fatty acids with an initial focus on industrial hemp. These technologies have been developed from active studies over the past few years and Boreal has been able to identify commercial applications for these technologies in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. This has led to new applications for selected food products that can incorporate these new forms of industrial hemp and other omega rich oils.Forward-Looking StatementsInformation set forth in this news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release.

Proof that the National Boy Scouts leadership are not qualified to lead this organization. With what little leadership skills they have, they should resign/quit/ or be fired now. Knowing this was going to happen, not preparing for it, letting it go on then the silence after the fact. The leaders of the Boy Scouts go against everything that the Scouts stand for. Leadership by the Girl Scouts organization were quick to take action by blocking Trump from coming in contact with their young members. The Boy Scout leaders need to man up and resign. This group must live under a rock in the woods to be that stupid as to how Trump is. These are not the type of men we want to lead our Boy Scouts any more.Join the Conversation1 / 5206

Vision


To be a leading provider of high quality plant-based functional foods and ingredients giving value to our customers, guided by sustainable principles. 

Enhancing health, lifestyle and the quality of life. 






8000 BCE
The first known existence of hemp in Taiwan is recorded. Hemp rope on pottery is dated back to before 8000 BCE.




6000-2000 BCE
Hemp is first used as food in China in 6000 BCE, for construction of the pyramids in Egypt in 3500 BCE and first recorded to be medicinally used as a health product by Emperor Shen Neng of China in 2737 BCE.




100-600s
Hemp is used in the construction of many roman style arch bridges, many of which stand to this day throughout France, Italy and Greece.




1600 - 1800s
Hemp is widely used for paper, textiles, rope, construction material and canvas for painting around the world. The US becomes a leading agricultural producer of hemp in the 1800s.




1930s
The US Congress Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 inhibits the growth of the hemp agricultural industry for textiles, food and construction material due to the new heavy taxation system which is lobbied to help increase the synthetic fiber industry. In the 1940s the criminalization of Marijuana, a close relative to industrial hemp seed Canabis Sativa L., began resulting in the ban on grown industrial hemp seed due to association.




1990s
The Canadian Government legalizes growing industrial hemp seed, a once thriving agricultural sector that has been on a  30+ year hiatus is reborn. The hemp movement is rejuvenated within Canadian Agricultural economy once again. Naturally Splendid’s newly acquired CHII Naturally Pure Hemp is incorporated in May 1998.




2010s
Naturally Splendid Enterprises is founded and subsequently launches their 4 retail brands and 4 biotech divisions in the next few years. In 2015 the company shows its biggest increase in stock value as it exemplifies rapid climb as a leader within its industry.




2016
Naturally Splendid undergoes a re-brand and re-launch of its brands division including the launch of a new marketing initiative for its online platforms. Innovative progress is continued to be made in its innovative bioactive ingredients as well as partnerships for HempOmega and CBD distribution within the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets. Large global hemp distribution deals are formalized from a new partnership in South Korea.

Our response was to apply advanced technology and science to hemp, and build a company that provides consumers, manufacturers and retailers access to high quality hemp products.  We wanted to build a company that brings hemp to the forefront of health, innovation and bio pharmaceuticals. Naturally Splendid has achieved this through consumer facing retails brands, scientific hemp breakthroughs with HempOmega, fulfilling wholesale plant based ingredients and applying science to the medicinal CBD industry.  Most importantly, our goal was to create products that people love, benefit from and are good for the environment.

A Canadian Company with a global focus on
redefining Hemp and CBD via Bio Technology.


NSE’s vision is to enhance the health, lifestyle and the quality of life of our customers by developing and delivering products that promote these fundamental beliefs. Guided by sustainable principles, our mission is to be a leading provider of high quality plant-based functional foods and ingredients giving value to our customers. NSE has built a solid foundation and assembled a team that I’m honored to be a part of. I see a vast opportunity as consumers become more health conscious and are demanding products that meet these criteria. 

I’ve watched NSE grow from a startup to an established corporate entity, for over 8 years,  it’s for these reasons I joined the NSE team at this point in its growth.  I look forward to guiding the company to continuing to be a leader in this sector”

CEO, Director of Naturally Splendid
