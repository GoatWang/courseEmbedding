WECLOME TO FRONTIER OILFIELD SERVICES



HYDRAULIC-FRACTURING OR FRACKING


Hydraulic-fracturing otherwise known as fracking, has literally changed the landscape of oil and gas in America.  Once deemed unrecoverable, advances in technology have opened the door to extracting massive deposits of oil and gas buried deep beneath the surface. In turn, this drive for development has led to tremendous opportunity for oilfield services companies that specialize in helping Operators manage critical drilling fluid and saltwater disposal (SWD).


SALTWATER DISPOSAL SERVICES (SWD)





Frontier Oilfield Services
provides logistically sound, environmentally compliant saltwater disposal services to major Operators throughout
East and North Central Texas

East Texas and North Central Texas Major Operators Rely on Frontier Oilfield Services to Meet Their Saltwater Disposal Needs



Continuing breakthroughs in oilfield technology have improved the process by which shale oil and gas is extracted. While advancing technology has positively impacted domestic energy production, it has also created a massive burden upon exploration and production (E & P) companies––the disposal of drilling and fracing fluids and salt water. As E&P companies continue to drill more wells and deploy more hydraulic fracturing to increase production, it becomes more and more critical to partner with professional oilfield services wastewater disposal and recovery companies with proven sophistication and logistics. Frontier Oilfield Services has an established track record of providing compliant, safe, and environmentally sound saltwater disposal to some of the Haynesville Shale's and the Barnett Shale's largest operators.

WECLOME TO FRONTIER OILFIELD SERVICES



HYDRAULIC-FRACTURING OR FRACKING


Hydraulic-fracturing otherwise known as fracking, has literally changed the landscape of oil and gas in America.  Once deemed unrecoverable, advances in technology have opened the door to extracting massive deposits of oil and gas buried deep beneath the surface. In turn, this drive for development has led to tremendous opportunity for oilfield services companies that specialize in helping Operators manage critical drilling fluid and saltwater disposal (SWD).


SALTWATER DISPOSAL SERVICES (SWD)





Frontier Oilfield Services
provides logistically sound, environmentally compliant saltwater disposal services to major Operators throughout
East and North Central Texas
