I've seen him twice (once under duress) and this has to be the kindest man with the best bedside manner of any doctor I've experienced. His staff is lovely and his nurse is amazing. I can't say enough wonderful things about my experiences so far.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 21, 2017 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 3KnowledgeThird time I have waited on appointment for up to 2 hours ....

After all I went through, I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to have any more children. I scheduled a consultation with Dr. Cummings and am so glad I did! He let me tell my lengthy story without interruption, listening intently the entire time. Afterwards, he talked me through all of my previous issues and offered validation about what I went through and reassurance about any future pregnancies. He is kind, compassionate, patient, extremely knowledgable and has a ton of experience in high risk pregnancy. I am feeling hopeful and confident for the first time since my previous pregnancy! So thankful I found Dr. Cummings! Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted April 19, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeSaved me from having a completely unnecessary c-section.

My mother was a. High risk with 6 previous miscarriages. My brother was delivered at 2lbs 9oz and because of his call saved his life. Thank you!!! He is now an 11 year old boy.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted August 3, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeIt's absolutely amazing what he does for women. For those who desire a vaginal birth, you could not ask for a better, more knowledgeable, or more caring provider. He's the best of the best. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted July 30, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI'm not sure if I can type this without tears flowing, but here it goes. Dr. Frederick Cummings has been SUCH a BLESSING to my family. My husband and I have NEVER, EVER had a doctor with so much patience and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He's exactly what we needed during my last pregnancy. We were praying and hoping for a VBA3C and it's almost impossible to do in this day without much faith and prayer. I believe with everything in me that the Lord placed us in the care of Dr. Frederick Cummings as an answer to the prayer we prayed 5 years ago when I recieved my first c-section. There were many times when I felt like taking the "easy way out" through repeat c-section, but each and every time Dr. Cummings would remind us of who we serve and He reminded us, "keep praying because we're going to do this." He would often encourage us to get rid of the fear, "no fear guys." He sent me to a perinatologist due to my previous child being a still birth(this was under the care of my previous doctor), and even when they would try and scare me into another c-section, all I would hear from Dr. Cummings is "no fear, keep praying". When everyone was freaked out about my pregnancy and birth history, Dr. Cummings was the one person along with my Husband and myself to remain in Faith. Today I am overwhelmed with joy to say that with the help of Dr. Frederick Cummings, I had my very first vaginal birth on 5-15-15!!!!!!!! @ 10:42am. My baby boy was 9lbs 11oz and 21 in. With the help of all the God sent nurses who encouraged me every step of the way, I labored for about 19 hours (never feeling rushed) and with the blessed hands of Dr. Cummings, I pushed my baby boy out in less than 15-20 minutes. I believe Dr. Cummings prayed for us every step of the way and that alone made all the difference:) <3 Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Lord and thank you Dr. Cummings<3Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted May 19, 2015 4Staff 1Punctuality 3Helpfulness 4KnowledgeI'm in the office now and they are running an hour + behind.
