Article - How New Tech and Trends Are Changing the Face of Vending Machines

Article - Welcome to the mall of 2039: It's nothing like today


07/31/14
Forget the fluorescent-lit indoor mall that's been synonymous with shopping for years. The future of retail will look starkly different 25 years out.
Full-body scanners that take your measurements, and recommend the clothes that best fit your body. Seamless checkouts that can be done from inside the dressing room or on your mobile phone, eliminating the need to wait in line.
Innovations like these are already threatening to become mainstream. And, as consumers shift a larger chunk of their spending toward the Web where they're offered a seemingly endless pipeline of products experts say bricks-and-mortar locations need to undergo a complete makeover to stay relevant in future decades.

Article - Vending machine industry lures back customers with healthier offerings


07/08/14
In the five years to 2018, the Canadian vending machine industry’s revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 1.9 per cent to about $715.8-million, driven by products such as coffee, tea, juice and healthy snacks, market researcher IBISWorld’s study from late 2013 shows.
“People expect more from the vending machines today,” said Mike Masse, president of food services at Compass Group Canada, which operates 5,000 automated merchandisers in Ontario, and is one of the largest players in Canada.
“You’re not going to have the standard wedge sandwich, lack of salads, a lack of yogurts and variety. I would say consumers today are looking for vending to have as good variety or choice as a caf or a food mall,” Mr. Masse said.

Article - Vending Industry Expert Predicts 35,000 Micromarket Locations Within Decade


08/26/13
The number of micromarket locations in the United States rose 170% between 2011 and 2012, according to a study conducted by veteran vending market researcher Brad Bachtelle of Bachtelle & Associates (Tustin, CA). "What have we done? We've created a new channel," Bachtelle said. "It's driving more sales, pleasing customers and exciting our industry." To gauge the success of the micromarket concept, Bachtelle & Associates worked with all the suppliers of self-checkout kiosks. They found that, in December 2012, there were 2,642 active micromarket locations with 2,724 active kiosks -- higher-volume micromarkets can have more than one checkout terminal.

Company to Create Innovative Line of Ice Cream and Related Consumer Products Targeting Millions of Hockey Fans Throughout North America

SANTA MONICA, CA--(Marketwired - Mar 4, 2015) - U-Vend, Inc. (OTCQB: UVND) (the "Company"), a consumer products and technology company that develops, distributes and markets next-generation self-serve electronic kiosks in a variety of retail environments across North America announced today that they have developed a proprietary, premium ice cream novelty product for the retail market called Pucks Premium Ice Cream™ (''Pucks").
"Pucks is geared to the hockey fan and is a creamy vanilla ice cream dipped in sweet dark chocolate in the shape and color of an actual hockey puck, and is mounted on a collectable replica mini hockey stick. Our intention is to produce the highest quality products for consumers, and we believe that our Pucks Premium Ice Cream™ will establish a branding foundation with which to subsequently launch additional unique consumer goods," said Paul Neelin, U-Vend Founder and COO, and creator of the Pucks concept.
The Company is currently developing initial points of distribution for Pucks, as well as exploring partnership, licensing and sponsorship opportunities. Initially, Pucks Premium Ice Cream™ will be offered in Canada through U-Vend's automated retail kiosks and merchandiser freezers located within convenience stores and other high traffic locations. As part of U-Vend's overall branding initiatives for the Pucks Premium Ice Cream™ line, the Company will add a "red light" to both the automated, self-serve kiosks and merchandisers, simulating the scoring of a goal when a Pucks product is sold.
"The introduction of our innovative Pucks product line represents a strategic entry into the multi-billion dollar North American ice cream market. The Pucks concept brings a wide assortment of potential licensing, sponsorship and related-product opportunities for U-Vend. We are very excited about offering Pucks to the consumer in both the U.S and Canadian markets through multiple sales channels including amateur and professional hockey arenas, local convenience stores, national retail stores and at special events," stated Raymond Meyers, CEO of U-Vend, Inc. 
The Company is scheduled to release the Pucks Premium Ice Cream™ consumer brand for the Canadian market in the second quarter 2015, with the U.S. market to follow. U-Vend intends to build a world-wide category of Pucks Premium Ice Cream™ quality products and merchandise for the consumer markets around the globe.

"Both Mark and Mike have had repeated high accomplishments at leading the production, sales and marketing efforts within numerous, multi-billion dollar consumer product companies, and as we begin the launch our new sport-themed ice cream products throughout North America, we couldn't ask for two more innovative, energized and focused executives," stated Raymond Meyers, CEO of U-Vend, Inc. 
"We are very fortunate to have Michael join our team at this stage of U-Vend's development, and I am looking forward to partnering with him as we build our line of unique consumer products," stated Mark Chapman. 
Prior to joining U-Vend, Crone was Senior Vice President of Sales at Well's Dairy from January 2005 through March 2015, a family-owned company producing and distributing the Blue Bunny and Weight Watchers brands, as well as private-label products for several major retailers. Under his direction, Well's Dairy sales increased 53% to $1.2 billion and elevated its brand from #7 nationally to #3. While at Wells, he expanded product distribution to many key retailers including Kroger, Safeway, Publix, Meijer, HEB and 7-11. Michael was responsible for over 500 people in the Retail Marketing and Sales team and increased Blue Bunny Novelty distribution over 60% to 81% and Weight Watchers to 91%, all-commodity volume (ACV). 
From October 1999 until January 2004, Crone served as Vice President, Sales and Distribution and Vice President, Distribution Strategy and Acquisitions at Nestlé Ice Cream Company, where he developed and implemented strategy for distribution that resulted in three successful acquisitions, with combined sales of $84.5 million, and two start-ups, all achieving economic profitability in two years. Crone grew points of distribution over 20% and annual sales 9-12% in non-supermarket channels by placing over 30,000 impulse freezers in select markets in 3 years, and successfully negotiated with Dreyers Grand Ice Cream that resulted in $23 million net profit improvement over 5 years.
From March 1991 to October 1999, Michael rose from Director of Southeast U.S. Sales to National Vice President of Sales at Häagen-Dazs Ice Cream Co., a division of Pillsbury/Diageo. He managed operational responsibilities that included P&L, sales, market share, trade marketing, customers, over 600 personnel, trucking fleet, logistics, over 80 distributors and field and HQ sales teams. He increased Häagen Dazs consumption at a 10% compound rate from 1998-2002, while driving annual sales from $325 million in 1991 to over $700 million in 1999 through developing agreements with Nestle and Ben and Jerry's. Prior to Häagen Dazs, Michael held progressively responsible positions at Frito Lay, culminating in Division Sales Manager responsible for $100 million in sales, 500 personnel and ranked #1 in performance out of 7 divisions. 
"I am very excited about this opportunity at U-Vend. The global branding relationships that are being developed create a strong value proposition with which to launch our new consumer products category. I think the potential of our sport-themed premium ice cream products, and the social interaction we can create with consumers, is tremendous. I am looking forward to working with Mark and the team at U-Vend," stated Crone.

UVND  +0%



Continuing Market Expansion Underwrites Company's Third North American Repository

SANTA MONICA, CA--(Marketwired - Jan 21, 2016) -  U-Vend, Inc. (OTCQB: UVND) (the "Company"), a consumer products and technology company that develops, distributes and markets next-generation self-serve electronic kiosks in a variety of retail environments across North America, announced that the Company has opened a custom kiosk and product supply depot in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Las Vegas location represents U-Vend's third U.S. depot, joining existing facilities located in Chicago, IL and Orange, CA. 
The Las Vegas depot will initially provide approximately 1,500 sq. ft. of operating space, and will primarily service the greater Las Vegas metropolitan area, where the Company has grown from zero to twenty-five self-serve kiosk machines in just six months. The depot will support the Company's Mini Melts product, in addition to its upcoming line of sport-themed ice cream products.

"I am pleased with the growth we've been able to capture in the Las Vegas market over the past six months.
