Review Text

                            Boston es una ciudad dividida entre ricos y pobres; blancos y negros; tradición y modernidad. Allí operan
los detectives privados Patrick Kenzie y Angela Gennaro. Él, un irlandés bocazas, miembro de una gloriosa saga de
bomberos. Ella, una chica bravucona, casada con un maltratador patológico. Forman un equipo de lo más eficaz para
encontrar a personas o cosas. Por eso van a ser contratados por unos peces muy gordos de la política: alguien les robó
unos documentos en vísperas de una votación controvertida y hay que recuperarlos sin que vean la luz. Los detectives
descubrirán que, en realidad, se trata de unas fotografías tan malditas como comprometedoras. Y también que, al
recuperarlas, se acaban de meter de cabeza en una zona de guerra entre bandas urbanas y poderes políticos como jamás
había sufrido la ciudad.show more
