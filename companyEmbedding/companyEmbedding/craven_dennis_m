Description

                    A volume in International Advances in Self Research Series Editors: Herbert W. Marsh, Rhonda G. Craven, and Dennis M. McInerney This volume deals with a wealth of issues related to self, from the overarching theoretical perspective of Bandura and his careful and thorough analysis of the agentic self, highlighting the complexities of our multiple selves acting in an integrated, holistic, and dynamic fashion, to the engaging and novel treatment of selfconcept as a rope by John Hattie. From many of the chapters we see the utility value of the social cognitive theory and self-determination theory frameworks for interpreting self-processes and how these processes might drive engagement in learning. In particular we see how autonomy support, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and self-regulation are part and parcel of self-processes intimately involved as individuals work out their futures and possible selves. Entwined with these processes are the development of identity, resilience, and a sense of well-being. The BFLPE and bullying chapters provide two examples of self-processes in operation in the school context. What can we take from this?Self-processes are complex, differentiated,and yet coordinated. By focusing on the agentic self we consider the whole person-picture as a rich, integrated, and dynamic tapestry and by focusing on differentiated self elements such as self-regulation, self-determination, self-concept, and self-efficacy, we are able to examine, in more detail, some of the individual threads of the tapestry and the roles they play in the integrated self. Overall, we learn that self-processes are dynamic and are fundamental to enabling human potential.show more

Chatham Lodging Promotes Dennis Craven To Chief Operating Officer; Jeremy Wegner Joins Company As CFO






Business Wire




May 4, 2015 4:10 PM EDT













 




























































  Chatham Lodging Trust (NYSE: CLDT), a hotel real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing in upscale, extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels, today announced that it has promoted Dennis M. Craven from chief financial officer to executive vice president and chief operating officer. The company also announced that Jeremy Wegner is joining the company as senior vice president and chief financial officer.  "With our portfolio of owned and joint-venture hotels now exceeding $3 billion and more than 130 hotels nationwide, combined with our appetite to continue building Chatham into the premier upscale, extended-stay and select-service hotel REIT, it was important for us to add depth to our executive management team," said Jeffrey H. Fisher, Chatham's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Dennis' promotion recognizes the significant contributions he has made to the company since joining Chatham and Jeremy brings nearly two decades of sophisticated financial and hospitality expertise to Chatham.  "Dennis will remain responsible for Chatham's overall financial strategy, will lead our expanding asset management, investor and brand relationship functions and oversee the overall operations of Chatham."  Mr. Wegner has a significant track record of involvement in more than $50 billion of mergers, acquisitions and equity and debt financings. Prior to joining Chatham, he served as vice president of mergers and acquisitions for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide where he was responsible for identifying and executing merger, acquisition, and divestiture opportunities. At Starwood he played a significant role in evaluating strategic alternatives for its timeshare business and executing the announced spin-off. Prior to that, he was a senior vice president in the real estate investment banking groups at Barclays Capital Inc. and Lehman Brothers where he covered the lodging sector for over ten years. He began his career as an analyst in the investment banking group at Credit Suisse in 1998. Mr. Wegner received a BA in Economics from Brown University.
