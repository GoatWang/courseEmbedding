Education and early life[edit]
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.[3][5] He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.[3] He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a Ph.D in Physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.[3][6]
Career and research[edit]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.[3] Gilbert's wife Celia had begun working for James Watson, and this led to Gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[7] In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.[3]
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics, and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.[8] He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
In 1996, Gilbert co-founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. along with Dr. Stuart B. Levy. Gilbert served as Chairman until 2014.[9]
Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.[8] In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents[10]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985.[11] Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari.[12] Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS,[13] though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by HIV[citation needed].
In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.[14]
With his Ph.D. student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor,[15] just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.[16]
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method[17][18] using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.[19]
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in Nature.[20] In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life,[21] based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Awards and honors[edit]




Walter Gilbert portrait via the National Library of Medicine


In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard's Ledlie Prize.[3] In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.[3] In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger.[3][22] That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[3]
Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977);[citation needed] the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Academie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977).[3] Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.[3][23][24]
In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award.[25][26]
Personal life[edit]
Gilbert married Celia Stone in 1953 and has two children.[2] After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career centered on digital photography.[11]

Education and early life[edit]
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.[3][5] He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.[3] He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a Ph.D in Physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.[3][6]
Career and research[edit]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.[3] Gilbert's wife Celia had begun working for James Watson, and this led to Gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[7] In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.[3]
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics, and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.[8] He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
In 1996, Gilbert co-founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. along with Dr. Stuart B. Levy. Gilbert served as Chairman until 2014.[9]
Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.[8] In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents[10]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985.[11] Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari.[12] Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS,[13] though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by HIV[citation needed].
In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.[14]
With his Ph.D. student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor,[15] just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.[16]
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method[17][18] using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.[19]
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in Nature.[20] In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life,[21] based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Awards and honors[edit]




Walter Gilbert portrait via the National Library of Medicine


In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard's Ledlie Prize.[3] In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.[3] In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger.[3][22] That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[3]
Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977);[citation needed] the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Academie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977).[3] Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.[3][23][24]
In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award.[25][26]
Personal life[edit]
Gilbert married Celia Stone in 1953 and has two children.[2] After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career centered on digital photography.[11]

Education and early life[edit]
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.[3][5] He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.[3] He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a Ph.D in Physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.[3][6]
Career and research[edit]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.[3] Gilbert's wife Celia had begun working for James Watson, and this led to Gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[7] In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.[3]
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics, and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.[8] He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
In 1996, Gilbert co-founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. along with Dr. Stuart B. Levy. Gilbert served as Chairman until 2014.[9]
Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.[8] In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents[10]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985.[11] Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari.[12] Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS,[13] though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by HIV[citation needed].
In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.[14]
With his Ph.D. student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor,[15] just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.[16]
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method[17][18] using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.[19]
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in Nature.[20] In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life,[21] based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Awards and honors[edit]




Walter Gilbert portrait via the National Library of Medicine


In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard's Ledlie Prize.[3] In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.[3] In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger.[3][22] That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[3]
Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977);[citation needed] the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Academie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977).[3] Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.[3][23][24]
In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award.[25][26]
Personal life[edit]
Gilbert married Celia Stone in 1953 and has two children.[2] After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career centered on digital photography.[11]

Walter Gilbert

Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts on March 21st, 1932 to Richard Gilbert, a Harvard University economist, and Emma Cohen, a child psychologist. In 1939 his family moved to Washington D.C., where he attended public schools and later the Sidwell Friends School. Gilbert developed an early interest in science; he ground mirrors for his own telescope, joined scientific clubs, and in 1949 was awarded a Westinghouse Science Scholarship by the Science Clubs of America Talent Search. In addition to his scientific pursuits, Gilbert wrote poetry, prose, and plays, and would go on to study philosophy and Chinese while an undergraduate.
In 1949 he graduated from Sidwell Friends School and pursued his scientific interests at Harvard University, studying chemistry and physics. He was awarded numerous scholarships, was elected to the Harvard Chapter of the Society of Sigma Xi, and graduated with a degree in physics in 1953. He then went on to attend Cambridge University (Trinity College) in England, aided by a National Science Foundation fellowship. At Cambridge his thesis advisor was future Nobel laureate Abdus Salam, and in 1957 he graduated with a PhD in mathematics. After graduation he returned to the United States and married Celia Stone, a poet he met while attending Sidwell Friends School.
In 1958 Gilbert joined the faculty at Harvard as a lecturer in physics, and in 1959 he was appointed assistant professor of physics. In the early 1960s he became interested in messenger RNA and worked with James D. Watson on experiments to isolate the nucleic acid. From this point on Gilbert’s scientific career would be primarily focused on molecular biology; his first paper on messenger RNA appeared in Nature in 1961, while his last paper on physics would be published in 1964. In 1964 he was appointed associate professor of biophysics, and in 1968 he was promoted to professor of biophysics.
Beginning in the mid-1960s he began investigating why different cells produce different proteins (even though they have identical DNA), and with Benno Müller-Hill he isolated the lac repressor gene in Escherichia coli, which prevented the production of certain enzymes except when lactose is present in the cell. This confirmed an earlier theory, proposed by Jacques Monod and François Jacob, that repressor genes regulate the process of protein synthesis in the cell. He then went on to develop a pioneering method for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid (Frederick Sanger independently developed the same method). For this work he was awarded the 1979 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University (with Sanger), the 1979 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (with Sanger and Roger Wolcott Sperry), and finally the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (with Sanger and Paul Berg).
In 1978 he cofounded, with other prominent biologists and businessmen, Biogen, one of the earliest biotechnology companies. He left Harvard to run the company in 1982. In 1985 he resigned as chairman and CEO of Biogen and returned to Harvard to conduct research. In 1987 he was appointed Carl M. Loeb University Professor at the university. In 1992 he founded the biotechnology company Myriad Genetics, and would go to serve on the advisory board of numerous other biotech firms.

He is married to Celia Stone, and has two children.

January 19, 2016 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held pharmaceutical company focused 
      on disease-modifying treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) 
      and other neurodegenerative diseases, today announced the election of 
      Nobel Laureate and former Biogen CEO Walter Gilbert, PhD, to the 
      company’s board of directors.
    


      “Dr. Gilbert brings an enormous breadth of experience as a scientist, 
      biotech founder, and executive,” said Justin Klee, Co-founder and 
      President of Amylyx. “We are honored that he will join our efforts to 
      advance AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS, which will be tested in an 
      initial clinical trial in patients later this year.”
    

      Dr. Gilbert has led an illustrious and multi-faceted career that spans 
      industry and academia. Dr. Gilbert co-founded Biogen and served both as 
      its CEO as well as the Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1981 to 
      1985; during this period he conducted its initial public offering. 
      Subsequently he co-founded several other life sciences companies 
      including Myriad Genetics, where he continues to serve as Vice Chairman 
      of the Board of Directors. His 40-year academic career at Harvard 
      University was marked by many discoveries in the fields of molecular 
      biology and genetics, including the development of a rapid method of DNA 
      sequencing for which received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He is 
      currently the Carl M. Loeb University Professor Emeritus at Harvard 
      University.
    

      “Amylyx has assembled an outstanding team that is advancing an 
      innovative approach to ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases,” said 
      Dr. Gilbert. “There is a strong foundation for AMX0035’s clinical 
      development in ALS based on early data from clinical studies of the 
      product’s components and the synergistic activity demonstrated in the 
      company’s preclinical studies. I am excited to help bring this promising 
      therapeutic to patients.”
    

About Amylyx PharmaceuticalsAmylyx is developing a novel 
      therapeutic for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other 
      neurodegenerative diseases that targets the neuroinflammation and nerve 
      cell death that characterize these disorders. The company’s therapeutic, 
      AMX0035, is a proprietary, fixed-dose combination therapy that blocks 
      nerve cell death and neurotoxic inflammation. AMX0035 is expected to 
      enter clinical trials in ALS patients in 2016. Learn more at: www.amylyx.com.
    

About ALSAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, is the most 
      prevalent, adult-onset progressive motor neuron disease, affecting 
      approximately 30,000 people in the US and an estimated 450,000 people 
      worldwide. ALS causes the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, 
      resulting in rapidly progressing muscle weakness and atrophy that 
      eventually leads to partial or total paralysis; on average the disease 
      is fatal within just four years. There is just one medicine approved 
      specifically for treating ALS, riluzole, and it only extends survival 
      marginally.

THE MOST DIRECT PATH TO YOUR DEGREE


































No matter where you want to go in nursing, Capella has an accredited online degree program that will provide the most direct path to your goals. Potentially save time and money and earn your degree in a more efficient way with unique pathways such as our BSN-to-DNP, RN-to-MSN, RN-to-BSN/MSN, and more.


















AFFORDABLE
TUITION


































Nursing Scholarships Available: Save up to $5,000*. Start your degree program and apply for a scholarship. Plus, employer, military, and nursing association discounts can make your degree even more affordable.




















APPLY PREVIOUS
 KNOWLEDGE

































Potentially reduce the time and cost of finishing your degree by maximizing your transfer credits from previous work (up to 75% of your program for BSN). You can also earn credits through our Prior Learning Assessment process by demonstrating mastery of competencies, and applying credentials like your CNML, CPHIMS, or ANCC RN-BC Informatics certification. 



















*MSN FlexPath option is not eligible.





















 
FlexPath: Your Degree. Your Pace.
As a nurse, you've got a lot on our plate. School is a priority, but in reality, family and work come first. With FlexPath, you can still build the career-advancing skills and knowledge you need, but with a class schedule entirely controlled by you. Earn your RN-to-BSN or MSN degree on your schedule.




































 

SELF-PACED: Once you complete a course, whether that takes you two weeks or 12, you're free to move on to the next course without having to wait for a new term to begin.

PACE DETERMINES PRICE: You can complete as many courses as you want, up to two simultaneously, each quarter for one flat tuition fee*. The faster your pace, the more money you may save.

LEVERAGE WHAT YOU KNOW: Because you already have a lot of knowledge and experience, you can move faster through what you know and take your time on what you need to learn.

SUPPORT AT EVERY LEVEL: From start to finish you'll have learning support from tutors, detailed feedback from faculty, and personalized planning from coaches.


* Books, supplies, and other fees may apply.

Education and early life[edit]
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.[3][5] He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.[3] He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a Ph.D in Physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.[3][6]
Career and research[edit]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.[3] Gilbert's wife Celia had begun working for James Watson, and this led to Gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[7] In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.[3]
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics, and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.[8] He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
In 1996, Gilbert co-founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. along with Dr. Stuart B. Levy. Gilbert served as Chairman until 2014.[9]
Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.[8] In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents[10]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985.[11] Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari.[12] Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS,[13] though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by HIV[citation needed].
In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.[14]
With his Ph.D. student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor,[15] just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.[16]
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method[17][18] using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.[19]
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in Nature.[20] In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life,[21] based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Awards and honors[edit]




Walter Gilbert portrait via the National Library of Medicine


In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard's Ledlie Prize.[3] In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.[3] In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger.[3][22] That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[3]
Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977);[citation needed] the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Academie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977).[3] Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.[3][23][24]
In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award.[25][26]
Personal life[edit]
Gilbert married Celia Stone in 1953 and has two children.[2] After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career centered on digital photography.[11]

Education and early life[edit]
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.[3][5] He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.[3] He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a Ph.D in Physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.[3][6]
Career and research[edit]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.[3] Gilbert's wife Celia had begun working for James Watson, and this led to Gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[7] In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.[3]
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics, and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.[8] He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
In 1996, Gilbert co-founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. along with Dr. Stuart B. Levy. Gilbert served as Chairman until 2014.[9]
Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.[8] In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents[10]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985.[11] Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari.[12] Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS,[13] though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by HIV[citation needed].
In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.[14]
With his Ph.D. student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor,[15] just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.[16]
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method[17][18] using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.[19]
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in Nature.[20] In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life,[21] based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Awards and honors[edit]




Walter Gilbert portrait via the National Library of Medicine


In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard's Ledlie Prize.[3] In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.[3] In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger.[3][22] That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[3]
Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977);[citation needed] the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Academie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977).[3] Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.[3][23][24]
In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award.[25][26]
Personal life[edit]
Gilbert married Celia Stone in 1953 and has two children.[2] After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career centered on digital photography.[11]

Education and early life[edit]
Walter Gilbert was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.[3][5] He was educated at the Sidwell Friends School, and attended Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a baccalaureate in chemistry and physics in 1953 and a master's degree in physics in 1954.[3] He studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a Ph.D in Physics supervised by the Nobel laureate Abdus Salam in 1957.[3][6]
Career and research[edit]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.[3] Gilbert's wife Celia had begun working for James Watson, and this led to Gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology. Watson and Gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[7] In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.[3]
He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies Biogen and Myriad Genetics, and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.[8] He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.
In 1996, Gilbert co-founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. along with Dr. Stuart B. Levy. Gilbert served as Chairman until 2014.[9]
Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome. At a March 1986 meeting in Santa Fe New Mexico he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.[8] In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents[10]
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1985.[11] Gilbert was an outspoken critic of David Baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari.[12] Gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of AIDS,[13] though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by HIV[citation needed].
In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics Gerald Guralnik extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the Higgs Boson.[14]
With his Ph.D. student Benno Müller-Hill, Gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor,[15] just beating out Mark Ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.[16]
Together with Allan Maxam, Gilbert developed a new DNA sequencing method[17][18] using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant DNA lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.[19]
Gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in Nature.[20] In 1986, Gilbert proposed the RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life,[21] based on a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967.
Awards and honors[edit]




Walter Gilbert portrait via the National Library of Medicine


In 1969, Gilbert was awarded Harvard's Ledlie Prize.[3] In 1972 he was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology.[3] In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger.[3][22] That year he was also awarded the Gairdner Prize and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[3]
Gilbert was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, shared with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid.
Gilbert has also been honored by the National Academy of Sciences (US Steel Foundation Award, 1968); Massachusetts General Hospital (Warren Triennial Prize, 1977);[citation needed] the New York Academy of Sciences; (Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award, 1977), the Academie des Sciences of France (Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer Award, 1977).[3] Gilbert was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987.[3][23][24]
In 2002, he received the Biotechnology Heritage Award.[25][26]
Personal life[edit]
Gilbert married Celia Stone in 1953 and has two children.[2] After retiring from Harvard in 2001, Gilbert has launched an artistic career centered on digital photography.[11]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
