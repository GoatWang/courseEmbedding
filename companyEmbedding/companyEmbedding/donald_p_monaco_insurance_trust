one hundred (100) votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at $1.00
per share. The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to a 10% annual dividend, payable as, when and if, declared by the Board of
Directors, payable on the first day of April, July, October and January.
Per the terms of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Designations relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to the availability of authorized and unissued shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock may, by written notice to the Company: 


 
●

(a) $25.00 per share; or

 
 
(b) at the lowest price the Company has issued stock as part of a financing.

 
●
convert all or part of such holder’s shares (excluding any shares issued pursuant to conversion of unpaid dividends) into debt obligations of the Company, secured by a security interest in all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, at a rate of $25.00 of debt for each share of Series A Preferred Stock.

 
●
elect to convert all or any part of such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, at a conversion rate of two (2) shares of Series A Preferred Stock for every one (1) share of Series C Preferred Stock.

Company to the holders of the common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof an amount
per share equal to $1.00 for each share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares)
of Series A Preferred Stock held by each such holder, plus the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared)
from the beginning of the dividend period in which the liquidation occurred to the date of liquidation. Additionally, each holder
of Series A Preferred Stock holds a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets in order to secure its
obligations in connection with such Series A Preferred Stock.
