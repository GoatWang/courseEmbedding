But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own?

Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

What you can expect from tree service professionals:Tree service professionals offer a full range of tree care services. Emergency tree removals, hazardous limb removals and cable bracing are some of the more critical services these professionals provide; however, they can also do hedge and shrub trimming, tree pruning and maintenance, and insect/disease evaluations and treatments. Along with mulching, pruning and other landscaping services, many tree service businesses will even decorate your trees for the holidays.If you live in an area that has its share of severe weather, it’s a good idea to have a certified arborist or tree care specialist look over the trees on your property. Trained arborists can spot possible trouble spots that the untrained eye might miss. For example, a tree with a deep crevice in the trunk could split in two during a heavy windstorm. A method called cable bracing can reinforce the tree so heavy winds are less likely to cause the tree to fail.  Your Crosslake, MN tree service professional or arborist might work in conjunction with another landscape professional to create a seamless landscape design. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of tree services: Landscape Contractors, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Garden & Landscape Supplies.Find tree service professionals on Houzz. Look in the Professionals section under Crosslake, MN tree services. You can look through portfolios and read reviews to see what past tree care clients have to say.

Swenson, Brad
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Arizona:













Does Swenson, Brad carry a valid contracting license?



Although the State of Arizona allows its residents to hire unlicensed contractors, it strongly encourages them to hire licensed contractors for remodeling or construction work.
Swenson, Brad currently holds license 39031 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in Arizona?



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors maintains high standards for licensing. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience (this varies a bit based on specialty).











Your liability risk when hiring Swenson, Brad



Licensed contractors in Arizona with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Swenson, Brad



Residential contractors are required to provide a consumer protection bond. This may be in the form of a Surety Bond; cash deposit in the amount of $200,000; or payment into the Residential Contractors' Recovery Fund. Under certain conditions, consumers may be eligible to apply to the residential contractors' recovery fund and receive up to thirty thousand dollars to have the work corrected or completed.











What else should I know before hiring Swenson, Brad



Starting in '02, the ROC began performing a criminal background check on license applicants by checking their fingerprints against the FBI criminal database. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Arizona Registrar of Contractors recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
