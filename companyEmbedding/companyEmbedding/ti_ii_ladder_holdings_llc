	On March 3, 2017, Ladder Capital Corp (Ladder or the Company), Related Real Estate Fund II, L.P. (Related), which is an affiliate of The Related Companies, L.P., and certain pre-IPO stockholders of Ladder, including affiliates of TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P. and GI Partners L.P., closed the previously announced purchase by Related of $80.0 million of Ladders Class A common stock (the Shares) from the pre-IPO stockholders. The investment was made by a wholly owned subsidiary of Related, which is an opportunity fund with equity commitments of over $1 billion.




	 




	As part of the closing of the transaction, Ladder and Related entered into a Stockholders Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2017, pursuant to which Jonathan Bilzin, Managing Director of TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P., resigned from the Board of Directors, and all committees thereof, and Ladder appointed Richard OToole, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of The Related Companies L.P., to replace Mr. Bilzin as a Class II Director on Ladders Board of Directors, each effective as of March 3, 2017. The Company thanks Mr. Bilzin for his years of dedicated service to the Company.




	 




	In connection with the foregoing, Mr. OToole was appointed to the Boards Audit Committee and Douglas Durst was appointed chair of the Boards Compensation Committee.




	 




	Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Ladder granted to Related a right of first offer with respect to certain horizontal risk retention investments in which Ladder intends to retain an interest and Related agreed to certain standstill provisions.




	 




	In addition, as part of the closing of the transaction, Ladder, certain pre-IPO stockholders and Related entered into a Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement providing, among other things, Related with customary registration rights with respect to the Shares.




	 




	In connection with Mr. OToole joining the Board of Directors, on March 3, 2017, he was granted restricted shares of the Companys Class A common stock, pursuant to Ladders 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, with a grant date fair value of $75,000, which represented 5,130 shares. The restricted shares vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date or upon a change in control of the Company, subject to Mr. OTooles continued service on the Board of Directors.




	 




	The foregoing descriptions of the Stockholders Agreement and the Second Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, copies of which are filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

	(d)


	                                

	If the Stockholder fails to accept a ROFO Offer during the ROFO Offer Period in accordance with Section 3(c), the Company shall be permitted to Transfer such Securitization Investment on substantially similar terms and conditions proposed to the Stockholder to a third

	Standstill and Transfer Restrictions

	(a)


	                                

	From and after the date hereof until the Termination Date (such period, the 

	Standstill Period

	), without the prior written approval of the Company, each Stockholder Party shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:  (i) acquire or offer to acquire, seek, propose or agree to acquire, by means of a purchase, tender or exchange offer, business combination or in any other manner, Beneficial Ownership of any Voting Securities, including rights or options to acquire such ownership; or (ii) other than pursuant to this Agreement, seek or propose to influence, advise, change or control the management, Board, governing instruments or policies or affairs of the Company, including by means of a solicitation of proxies (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act, disregarding Rule 14a-1(l)(2)(iv) thereunder), including any otherwise exempt solicitation pursuant to Rule 14a-2(b) under the Exchange Act) or seeking to influence, advise or direct the vote of any holder of Voting Securities;

	provided

	,

	however,

	that the Standstill Period shall terminate automatically upon (A) any person (x) becoming the Beneficial Owner of Voting Securities representing 50% or more of the Total Voting Power or (y) publicly announcing or commencing a tender or exchange offer that, if consummated, would make such Person (or any of its Affiliates) the Beneficial Owner of Voting Securities representing 50% or more of the Total Voting Power or (B) the Company entering into a definitive agreement with a third party to effectuate (x) a sale of 50% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries or (y) a transaction (1) that, in whole or in part, requires the approval of the Companys stockholders and, (2) in which, based on information publicly available at the time of announcement of the entering into of such agreement, the holders of Voting Securities prior to such transaction will not own, immediately following such transaction, Voting Securities representing at least 80% of the Total Voting Power of either (I) the corporation resulting from such transaction (the 

	Surviving Corporation

	), or (II), if applicable, the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of all of the outstanding Voting Securities of the Surviving Corporation.  Nothing in this Section 4(a) shall (i) limit the New Class II Director from taking any actions in his or her capacity as a director of the Company or (ii) prohibit the acquisition by the Stockholder Parties of Beneficial Ownership of Voting Securities or any derivative or synthetic interests or any hedging, swap, forward or other derivative contracts in relation thereto;

	provided

	, that after giving effect thereto, the Stockholder Parties Beneficial Ownership of Voting Securities does not exceed 9.8% of the Total Voting Power.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	Neither the Stockholder nor any of the other Stockholder Parties shall Transfer any Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by them to any



	 



	7













	 




	Permitted Transferee unless such Permitted Transferee becomes a party to and fully subject to and bound by this Agreement to the same extent as the transferring party by executing and delivering a joinder to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit A

	.




	 




	(c)


	                                 

	Without limiting the foregoing, the Stockholder Parties agree that they will not Transfer any Voting Securities except in compliance with any applicable state, federal or foreign securities Laws.



	 




	(d)


	                                

	The right of any Stockholder Party or any of their respective Affiliates to Transfer Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by such Person is subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 4, and no Transfer by any Stockholder Party or any of its Affiliates of Voting Securities Beneficially Owned by such Person may be effected except in compliance with this Section 4.  Any attempted Transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be of no effect and null and void, regardless of whether the purported transferee has any actual or constructive knowledge of the Transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement, and the Company shall not, and shall instruct its transfer agent and other third parties not to, record or recognize any such purported transaction on the share register of the Company.  No Transfer by a Stockholder Party shall be effective unless and until the Company shall have been furnished with information reasonably satisfactory to it demonstrating that such Transfer is (x) in compliance with this Section 4 and (y) registered under, exempt from or not subject to the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities Laws.



	 




	(e)


	                                 

	Any additional Voting Securities of which any Stockholder Party acquires Beneficial Ownership following the date hereof and prior to the Termination Date shall be subject to the restrictions and commitments set forth in this Section 4 as fully as if such Voting Securities were Beneficially Owned by such Person as of the date hereof.

	Synthetic Offering

	))  (other than (i) pursuant to a Demand Registration, in which case the ability of a holder of Registrable Shares to participate in such Demand Registration shall be governed by

	Section 2

	(b)  

	Priority on Primary Registrations

	(c)  

	Priority on Secondary Registrations

	.  If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of the Class A Shares (which includes a Synthetic Offering, with any such Synthetic Offering being deemed an underwritten offering of Registrable Shares solely for purposes of this Agreement) (it being understood that Demand Registrations on behalf of holders of Registrable Shares are addressed in

	Section 3

	rather than in this

	Section 4(c)

	), and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion the number of Class A Shares requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the holders initially requesting such registration and without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, then the Company shall include in such Piggyback Registration (i) first, the number of Registrable Shares requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration, pro rata among the holders of such Registrable Shares according to the number of Registrable Shares held by each such holder relative to the total number of Registrable Shares held by all such holders of Registrable Shares requesting to include Registrable Shares in such Piggyback Registration as of the date the Company provided written notice of such Piggyback Registration to the holders of Registrable Shares (while subject to each such holder of Registrable Shares including in such Piggyback Registration no more than the number of Registrable Shares requested by such holder to be included in such Piggyback Registration) and, if all Registrable Shares requested to be included in such Piggyback Registration have been included, (ii) second, any other Class A Shares requested to be included in such registration, in such manner as the Company may determine.

	(e)  

	Other Registrations

	.  If the Company has previously filed a registration statement with respect to Registrable Shares pursuant to

	Section 2

	,

	Section 3

	or pursuant to this

	Section 4

	, and if such previous registration has not been withdrawn or abandoned, then all the parties hereto agree that the Company shall not be required to effect any other registration of any of its equity or similar securities or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for its equity or similar securities under the Securities Act (except in connection with a Demand Registration), whether on its own behalf or at the request of any holder or holders of such securities, until a period of at least 180 days has elapsed from the effective date of such previous registration.

	5.    

	Holdback Agreements

	.




	 




	(a)   No holder of Registrable Shares shall sell, transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale (including sales pursuant to Rule 144) of any equity securities of the Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any such equity securities, during the seven days prior to (except in the case of an Underwritten Shelf Offering, in which case, during the three business days prior to) and the up to 90-day period (with the ultimate duration of such period to be as determined by the underwriters managing the applicable underwritten offering of Registrable Shares) beginning on the effective date of the final prospectus for any underwritten offering of Registrable Shares with an aggregate offering value of Registrable Shares of at least $10,000,000 (the 

	Holdback Period

	Withdrawing Holders

	)), by written notice to the Company, to withdraw from this Agreement and as a result of such withdrawal, such Withdrawing Holders shall no longer be entitled to the rights, nor subject to the obligations of this Agreement, and the Registrable Shares held by the Withdrawing Holders shall irrevocably and conclusively cease to be Registrable Shares under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no withdrawal pursuant to this

	8.    

	Indemnification

	.




	 




	(a)  

	By the Company

	.  The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to agree to, indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each holder of Registrable Shares, its officers, directors, members, employees, agents, stockholders and general and limited partners and each Person who controls such holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act and Exchange Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof), joint or several, arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, reports required and other documents filed under the Exchange Act, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, together with any documents incorporated therein by reference, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged violation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any federal, state, foreign or common law rule or regulation and relating to action or inaction in connection with any such registration, disclosure document or other document and shall reimburse such holder, officer, director, member, employee, agent, stockholder, partner or controlling Person for any legal or other expenses, including, without limitation, any amounts paid in any settlement effected with the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, incurred by such holder, officer, director, member, employee, agent, stockholder, partner or controlling Person in connection with the investigation or defense of such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such holder expressly for use therein.  In connection with an underwritten offering, the Company shall indemnify such underwriters, their officers, directors, agents and employees  and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders of Registrable Shares.




	 




	(b)  

	By the Holders

	.  In connection with any registration statement in which a holder of Registrable Shares is participating, each such holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information about such holder as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and the other holders of Registrable Shares against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such holder which authorizes its use in the applicable document;

	provided

	that the obligation to indemnify will be individual, not joint and several, for each holder and will be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such holder from the sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to such registration statement.




	 




	(c)  

	Claim Procedures

	.  Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it




	 



	21













	 




	seeks indemnification (

	provided

	that the failure to give prompt notice will not impair any Persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and the indemnifying party shall not, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof, a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation provided by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party.  An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay (i) the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim or (ii) any settlement made by any indemnified party without such indemnifying partys consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).




	 




	(d)  

	Survival; Contribution

	.  The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, agent or employee and each other Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities and each other Person, if any, who controls such indemnified party (within the meaning of the Securities Act), and will survive the transfer of securities.  The Company also agrees to make such provisions, as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party, for contribution to such party in the event the Companys indemnification is unavailable for any reason.




	 




	9.    

	Participation in Underwritten Registrations

	.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no holder of Registrable Shares may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten or otherwise a distribution of shares hereunder unless such holder (a) agrees to sell such holders applicable Registrable Shares on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements (including, without limitation, (i) pursuant to the terms of any over allotment or green shoe option requested by the managing underwriter(s) and (ii) agreeing to pay its pro rata share for the fees and expenses of any third party advisor or consultant retained by the Person or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, including for any financial consulting services;

	provided

	that no holder of Registrable Shares shall be required to sell more than the number of Registrable Shares that such holder has requested the Company to include in any registration) and (b) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements (including, without limitation, any applicable lock-up agreement);

	provided

	that no holder of Registrable Shares included in any underwritten registration shall be required to make any representations or warranties to the Company or the underwriters (other than representations and warranties regarding such holder and such holders




	 



	22













	 




	intended method of distribution) or to undertake any indemnification or contribution obligations to the Company or the underwriters with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in

	Section 8

	.
