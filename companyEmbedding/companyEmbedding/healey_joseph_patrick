Job Details
               Company Size: $10 mil to less than $25 mil - Employee Range: 100 to less than 500. University Liggett School offers a rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum to nearly 300 students from 60 communities in southeastern Michigan. For more than 130 years, Liggett has prepared students for college and beyond, by asking them to fully participate in our comprehensive program. Liggett offers outstanding arts and athletics opportunities and expects that students will take full advantage of these co-curricular programs. Our graduates attend the finest colleges in the country, and return to become leaders in this community. In the Upper School, Liggett students are asked to take ownership of the learning process, accept risks, and discover a passion for a subject or discipline. This step requires trust so, beginning in ninth grade, we focus on team building and emphasize the student-teacher relationship. A recent alumni survey suggests that our strategy is working. Many of our graduates still recall that moment when a Liggett teacher helped unlock a door to discovery. In the 9th and 10th grade, the curriculum concentrates on building mastery of core subjects and our students are asked to do more with the material. In English and history, students learn to weigh and challenge new ideas and to use essential questions in this examination process. In the 11th grade, students begin take more control of their overall program of study and have the opportunity to delve more deeply into the subjects that keep them most engaged. That concept - meaningful engagement - is a daily goal. We ask students to participate fully in each process and to "own their own lives." We make this request of our athletes, artists and community servants as well. Practice like you play. Walk the Walk for Hunger. Sing with volume and intensity and have your voice heard. At Liggett, your place is not on the sidelines unless you are there to support your classmates - and we expect that, too. You have just one shot at high school, so we think you should make the most of each moment. This is all a part of the college preparation process, a process that culminates with one-on-one guidance from our dedicated college counselor. Liggett graduates gain admission to the nation's most respected colleges, and are offered dozens of the country's most prestigious scholarships. It is one thing to gain admission to a top school, it is quite another to arrive on campus with all the tools necessary to make the most of that experience as well. Spend a day with us and see the Liggett difference: See what it looks like to engage yourself more fully and take ownership of your own experience.

Autumn Joy Ventling & Joseph Patrick Healey — Minted












Autumn Joy Ventling and Joseph Patrick Healey
















Please join us for our wedding celebration on September 23, 2017
                


                    Our Story
                

                    
    Our story began in Tennessee.  Autumn moved to Franklin, TN from Wooster, Ohio in 2012 to pursue her career as a hair stylist.  Joe moved to Chicago from his hometown of Cincinnati in 2012 to pursue a career with Allstate.  His rotational program with Allstate brought him to Nashville in the summer of 2013.  The couple eventually met in February of 2014.  They continued getting to know each other by pursuing common interests - boating, hiking to waterfalls, whitewater rafting and dinner dates.  Shortly after, Joe moved back to Chicago in July of 2014 to continue to pursue his career.  They dated long distance for a year - flying to one another when possible, exploring the city of Chicago and meeting halfway for camping trips.  After a year of dating long distance, Joe took Autumn to Mt. Echo Park overlooking the Cincinnati skyline where he announced that he would be moving back to Nashville!  The same scenic view of Mt. Echo Park played as the beautiful backdrop for Joe's engagement proposal to Autumn.

General Information
Funded by the Office of the President of the University of Massachusetts and the Office of the Vice Provost for Research and Strategic Initiatives & Dean of Graduate Studies of the University of Massachusetts Boston, the Healey Research Grant program supports research and scholarly activities of faculty and research staff members that enhance the quality of the academic and intellectual life at the university. All forms of research and scholarly activities may be funded through this research grant program. Faculty members in disciplines with external funding sources should view these funds as seed money for the initiation of new lines of research, the collection of pilot data, and publications of preliminary results that are essential to the development of a proposal for extramural support of research.
Budget Considerations of the Healey Research Grant Program
A total of $150,000 is reserved for this competition. Applicants may request up to $7,500 in grant funds for a proposal from one individual, or $12,000 for an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary proposal from two or more Co-PIs. Funds may be used to pay project expenses including: research assistants, technical and clerical support beyond that normally available through the applicant's department, travel, communications, and supplies. Only in unusual circumstances will the purchase of equipment be funded by this grant program. Course buyout with internal grants is no longer feasible and will not be supported.  Salaries or additional compensations for PI or Co-PIs will not be funded by this grant program. Funds can only be used to cover the expenses by and for UMass Boston faculty, research staff and students.
Who may submit a proposal
Any active UMass Boston faculty member or full-time research staff member is eligible to submit a proposal for consideration. Joint interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary proposals from a research team of two or more individuals from one or more departments/colleges/universities are strongly encouraged. An individual faculty or staff member (as PI) may receive. An individual faculty or staff member (as PI) may receive

one grant in a given year from all internal grant competitions (e.g., Healey Research, Public Service, Proposal Development),
up to three total grants from any combination of internal grant competitions in 6 years, and
up to two grants in 6 years in a single internal grant program (e.g., two Healey Research grants in 6 years).

Individuals who received a Healey Research grant during the last six years, but have not submitted a required internal report and published any books or articles in peer-reviewed journals, or submitted a proposal for external funding are no longer eligible for support under this program. Funding priorities will be given to the newly hired tenure-track assistant professors and faculty in disciplines without external sources of significant funding. Applications from those who have received significant startup packages (>$100,000) from the university during the last six years without winning any external grants will not be considered.
Submission Deadline
Applications must be submitted via email and received by the close of business day (5:00 pm EST) on Friday, February 12, 2016. Submit all materials to internal.grants@umb.edu. A confirmation message will be sent to you once your application has been received. If you do not receive a confirmation message within 24 hours, please contact Matthew.Meyer@umb.edu. It is the responsibility of the individual submitting the proposal to ascertain that one complete copy of the proposal has been received for processing by the deadline.
What to Submit
In order to expedite the review of proposals, applicants are required to submit proposals in one PDF file, which must include the following components:

Cover sheet (form attached) with applicant and proposal information, a no more than 50-word abstract, list of all internal grants previously awarded to the applicant(s), and signatures from the appropriate persons or groups.
Budget (form attached) presenting a breakdown of project expenses by category.
Budget narrative explaining each item requested on the budget form.  If equipment is requested, provide exact specifications and cost, and explain why existing departmental or university equipment cannot be borrowed or used. (Please note that equipment is defined as items that cost >/= $5,000) Requests for graduate assistants during the academic year must conform to the pay scale and other requirements of the Graduate Employees Organization bargaining agreement available at https://hr.umb.edu/unions. Also include a description of any other project costs that are being provided by the department, college, unit, or other source.
Project narrative describing the project for which funding is being requested.  The project narrative is the core of the proposal. Members of the review committee will make their recommendations based on their interpretation of your project as described in this section. It is to the applicant’s advantage to provide background information in enough detail to convey why the project is significant, what will be accomplished, the methodology to be used, the schedule of activities, and how the project fits into an ongoing research plan and advances UMass Boston's research agenda. The applicant must be as clear as possible, remembering that the readers will represent various disciplines and program areas and will not necessarily have strong expertise in the subject matter of the proposal. If the work of others is referenced, include a list of the sources cited. The project narrative must be limited to eight (8) double-spaced pages and must include the following elements:

significance of the proposed project;
brief review of relevant literature or prior art;
project goals and objectives with a timeline for accomplishment;
methodology, research design, or set of activities that will be used to carry out the proposed project;
anticipated outcomes of the proposed project (e.g., preparation of a manuscript for publication, production of a piece of music or art, presentation at a professional meeting, submission of a proposal for external funding); and
qualifications of the applicant(s) that ensure the success of the project if funded (especially important if the attached CV(s) does not reflect previous work of this nature).


CV of the applicant (not to exceed 3 pages) focusing on research, scholarship, and publications that relate to the proposed research and a list of any external grants received. Include a CV (in same format as applicant’s) for each individual if a research team is submitting the project proposal.
Other documents, such as letters of commitment or approvals from other organizations, departments, or units for the use of specialized equipment, personnel, or supplies.

Review of Proposals
A committee composed of faculty and research staff in the basic sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional fields will review all proposals. The committee will make recommendations to the Vice Provost for Research & Strategic Initiatives and Dean of Graduate Studies who will make all final decisions. Grant awards will be announced by April 15, 2016.
Proposals will be evaluated on the following criteria:

Significance: The extent to which the proposed project will make an original and important contribution to the field of inquiry it addresses.
Project Design:  The extent to which the conceptual framework, design, methods, activities, and analyses are properly developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the aims of the proposed project.
Budget and Cost-Effectiveness: The extent to which the funding requested is adequate and appropriate to the project objectives and activities.

Grant Management
All Healey research grants are administered in accordance with established university fiscal procedures and policies relating to the conduct of sponsored programs. Award accounts will be established by June 30, 2016, and project expenditures can begin on July 1, 2016. All funds must be expended by June 30, 2017. The following conditions are attached to the award and must be accepted by the recipient at the time of the grant award:

A final project report must be filed with the Office of Research and Graduate Studies by August 31, 2017, summarizing grant activities, outcomes, and expenditures.
One copy of submitted, published, or conference papers, and facsimiles or descriptions of artistic creations that result from the project activities must be submitted to the Office of Research and Graduate Studies when they become available.
All publications resulting from the grant project and all narratives associated with exhibitions or performances of works resulting from the grant project must acknowledge the assistance of the Joseph P. Healey Research Grant program of the University of Massachusetts Boston.
