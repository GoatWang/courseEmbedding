Leroy M. Sensenig was born July 25th, 1909, and grew up on a small farm near Blue Ball in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  He was one of ten children, and worked on several different farms as hired help.  At the age of 19 he began working at Trupe's Feed Mill, near Terre Hill. 


Then in 1936 a friend of Leroy's father asked Leroy to manage a small mill he owned.  After 9 years of experience Leroy decided to buy his own mill and purchased the Hinkletown Feed Mill from Earl Sauder in 1945 and Sensenig's Feed Mill began.  Then in 1959 Leroy's son Ken began working at the feed mill after working on several farms as a boy. 
In 1961 Leroy's interest changed to restoring an old mill near Red Run.  Ken took over the mill at Hinkletown, and in 1969 became part of the newly formed Leroy M. Sensenig Inc.  One year later, Martins Feed Mill in Ephrata was purchased to assist with the growth at the Hinkletown Mill. 
Ken's sons began working in the business with Mike in 1979, Scott in 1984, and Karl in 1987.  In 1985 Sensenig's Feed Mill moved once again to New Holland, purchasing the Earl Sauder Feed Mill, which is where the mill is located today. 


Ken retired in 2003, and now Mike, Scott, and Karl have taken over and continued to grow Sensenig's Feed Mill.  Mike's Sons, Kyle and Kurt (the 4th generation), have also started working at the mill and learning the business "Great Grandpa Leroy" started back in 1945.
