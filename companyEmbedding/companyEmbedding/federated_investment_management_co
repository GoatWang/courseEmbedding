Federated Investment Management Company Recommends Reorganization of Closed-End Funds and Tender Offer

PITTSBURGH, June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Investment Management Company, the investment advisor to Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:    FPT) and Federated Premier Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:   FMN), today announced that it recommended to the Boards of Trustees of FPT and FMN, and the Boards of Trustees approved, that FPT reorganize into FMN, with FMN being the surviving fund.  The reorganization, which requires shareholder approval, is expected to be a tax-free transaction completed during the fourth quarter of 2017.  








Federated Investment Management Company also has recommended to the Board of Trustees of FPT, and the Board of Trustees has approved, FPT conducting a tender offer for up to 20 percent of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98 percent of net asset value at the close of trading on the date the tender offer expires.  This tender offer would be completed prior to the reorganization of FPT into FMN.  
The specific dates for FPT's tender offer will be announced separately, but it is currently anticipated that the tender offer will commence in July 2017 and end in August 2017.  Additional terms and conditions of FPT's tender offer will be set forth in its offering materials, which will be distributed to its common shareholders.  Should the number of common shares tendered, and not withdrawn, exceed 20 percent of FPT's outstanding common shares, FPT will purchase common shares from tendering common shareholders on a pro rata basis.  Accordingly, common shareholders cannot be assured that FPT will purchase all of their tendered common shares.
Following the tender offer, if shareholders approve the reorganization, FPT would reorganize into FMN.  It is currently anticipated that if the tender offer is completed by the end of August 2017 that the reorganization may be completed by the end of November 2017.  The two funds have identical investment objectives and substantially similar investment strategies focused on tax-exempt municipal bonds, with FPT's portfolio having an intermediate duration that is currently shorter than the duration of FMN's portfolio.  FMN invests in long-term, tax-exempt municipal bonds as it seeks to provide its shareholders current income through a variety of market cycles.
Federated Investment Management Company reached an agreement with FPT's largest shareholder to support the reorganization of FPT pursuant to which that shareholder has withdrawn the shareholder proposal and nominations it had previously submitted to FPT. FPT's largest shareholder also has agreed to certain customary standstill provisions until the termination of the agreement.
Federated Investment Management Company believes the tender offer and subsequent reorganization are in the best interest of FPT and its shareholders as well as FMN and its shareholders.  The tender offer would provide some liquidity to FPT common shareholders seeking it, and the reorganization of FPT into FMN would provide FPT shareholders continuing to seek tax-exempt income the option to pursue that investment strategy through a leveraged closed-end fund.  The reorganization would afford FMN shareholders the opportunity to continue their investment in a long duration tax-exempt municipal closed-end fund with larger assets and attractive portfolio characteristics, such as broader yield-curve diversity.
Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE:   FII) is one of the largest investment managers in the United States, managing $361.7 billion in assets as of March 31, 2017.  With 123 funds and a variety of separately managed account options, Federated provides comprehensive investment management to more than 8,400 institutions and intermediaries including corporations, government entities, insurance companies, foundations and endowments, banks and broker/dealers.  For more information, visit FederatedInvestors.com.
This press release is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of FPT or FMN. FPT has not commenced the tender offer described in this press release. Any tender offer would be made only by an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other documents that would be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) as exhibits to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO and would be available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.  
This press release describes a reorganization, which will be conducted pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization that will be included in a registration statement, to be filed by FMN (Registration Statement). This Registration Statement has yet to be filed with the SEC. After the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, it may be amended or withdrawn until the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. A joint proxy statement/prospectus to be included in the Registration Statement will not be distributed to shareholders of FPT and FMN unless and until the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. The joint proxy statement/prospectus will contain information with respect to the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds and other important information about FPT and FMN. The joint proxy statement/prospectus will constitute neither an offer to sell securities, nor will it constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy securities, in any state where such offer or sale is not permitted.
Shareholders should read (i) any offer to purchase and tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits and (ii) any Registration Statement and joint proxy statement/prospectus if and when those documents are filed and become available, as they would contain important information about the tender offer and proposed reorganization, respectively. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of FPT and FMN carefully. 
Certain statements made in this press release, such as those related to the tender offer and reorganization and the opportunity for enhanced liquidity and shareholder value, are forward-looking statements. Actual future results or occurrences may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors.  These include, but are not limited to: market developments; legal and regulatory developments; and other additional risks and uncertainties.  As a result, none of the investment advisor, the fund or any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements in the future.

Latest Action: On August 4, 2010, the SEC announced a distribution of more than $63 million to more than 530,000 investors who were harmed by market timing and late trading in certain Federated mutual funds.  The distribution was the first of two disbursements totaling approximately $77 million. 
A second distribution of more than $13 million to more than 77,000 investors was made on September 21, 2010. Investors can obtain additional information about the distribution process by visiting http://www.federatedfairfundsettlement.com/start.asp or by calling the Fund Administrator, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc., at (888) 850-3536.
Background: On November 28, 2005, the SEC instituted and settled administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Federated Investment Management Company, Federated Securities Corp. and Federated Shareholder Services Company. The SEC issued an Order finding that the respondents harmed long-term mutual fund shareholders by allowing undisclosed market timing and late trading by favored clients and an employee. As part of the settlement, the respondents have paid $72 million, consisting of $27 million in disgorgement and $45 million in a civil penalty for distribution to defrauded shareholders. For more information on the SEC�s action, you can read In the Matter of Federated Investment Management Company, Federated Securities Corp. and Federated Shareholder Services Company at IA-2448 (Nov. 28, 2005).

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

History[edit]
Federated Investors was founded in 1955 by high school classmates John F. Donahue, Richard B. Fisher, and Thomas J. Donnelly.[3]
Aetna acquired a majority ownership stake in Federated Investors in 1982; at the time Federated had nearly $30 billion in assets under management.[4] In 1989, Federated management bought out Aetna for $345 million, reestablishing majority control of the company.[5] In 1996, Federated management paid $100 million to acquire the remaining 25% stock ownership still held by Aetna.[6] Federated completed an initial public offering on the NYSE on May 14, 1998.[7]
In 1991 Federated established Federated International Management Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, becoming the first U.S. company whose registered money market funds were approved for distribution to the European community. In 1998, Federated launched a venture with Frankfurt insurer LVM-Versicherungen to offer Federated funds in Germany and other German-speaking countries.[8]
In April 2012 Federated Investors, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prime Rate Capital Management LLP (PRCM), a London, United Kingdom-based provider of institutional liquidity and fixed income products, from Matrix Group Limited they did not purchase this company. Federated Prime Rate Capital Management's AAA-rated liquidity funds, known as Qualifying Money Market Funds, serve the corporate and institutional market. The funds, totaling approximately $4.0 billion USD (GBP 2.5 billion) in assets, are rated AAA by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings.[9]
In September 2012, Federated Investors announced that it had bought around $4.4 billion in assets from Fifth Third Asset Management Inc.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
