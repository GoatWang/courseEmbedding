What is Project Management?


Who are Project Managers?


Core Values


PMI Founders











It began as a dinner in early 1969 among three men at the Three Threes Restaurant, a small, intimate gathering place just a few blocks from City Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
The dinner was a continuation of several months of discussions between two of the men, Jim Snyder and Gordon Davis. By the conclusion of this meal, it was decided that a new organization should be formed to provide a means for project managers to associate, share information and discuss common problems.
Ensuing discussions resulted in the first formal meeting at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, on 9 October 1969. The by-product of this meeting was the birth of the Project Management Institute. Shortly thereafter, articles of incorporation were filed in Pennsylvania, signed by five persons, who are officially recognized as the founders of PMI - James Snyder, Eric Jenett, Gordon Davis, A. E. "Ned" Engman and Susan C. Gallagher.






James R. Snyder
Mr. Snyder is a founder of the Project Management Institute, a Fellow of the Institute, and a past Volunteer Executive Director, President and Chairman of the Board. He is currently a member of the Board of Directors of the PMI Educational Foundation, Treasurer of the Delaware Valley Chapter, and a member of the Editorial Review Board of Project Management Journal. Mr. Snyder, who is casually referred to as the "Father of PMI," has been awarded the PMI Man of the Year Award and is an Honorary Life Member of the Institute. He is also a founding member of the PMI Delaware Valley Chapter and the Pharmaceuticals Specific Interest Group (SIG). Mr. Snyder served as the project manager for the construction of PMI's World Headquarters in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, USA. The PMI James R. Snyder Center for Project Management Knowledge and Wisdom, located in the headquarters building, is named in his honor.








Eric Jenett, PMP
Mr. Jenett, one of PMI’s five original founders, was PMI's first Project Management Professional (PMP®). A PMI Fellow, Mr. Jenett was PMI's President in 1971, Chairman in 1972 and Secretary from 1975 to 1976. A founding member of the PMI Houston Chapter, Mr. Jenett was honored by PMI in 1975 for his Distinguished Contribution to the Institute. He presented at numerous PMI Seminars & Symposiums, served on a number of panels, and published a variety of articles in the Project Management Quarterly, later to become the Project Management Journal®, and in a number of other technical publications. He wrote and lectured on technical and project management topics and had more than 30 publications and presentations.








J. Gordon  Davis, PhD
Dr. Davis is member number four in PMI and is a former Vice President of the Institute. He effectively served PMI in many capacities, including the coordination of the Institute's early-on academic activities, and has received nearly every honor that the organization bestows, including the designation of PMI Fellow. His interest in helping to create PMI was to provide a forum for discussing the emerging concepts and practices in the field, and to identify a profession of project management that was not otherwise perceived as a profession. Dr. Davis continues to challenge PMI members and leaders to build professionalism in project management and to focus on the multi-disciplinary aspects of project management that play such a vital role in bringing projects of all sizes to a successful conclusion.
