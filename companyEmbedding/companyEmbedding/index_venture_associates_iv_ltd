Outgoings

Business Rates/Property Tax
                        No properties were found where INDEX VENTURE GROWTH ASSOCIATES III (IGP), L.P. is liable for the business rates / property tax. This could be for a number of reasons. The council hasnt published the data We havent found or been able to process the councils data The company is part of a group of companies and another company in the group is liable for business rates The registered office may be a residential address which does not have a commercial designation. If the business is run from home then it won't be a commercial property and hence won't be liable for business rates. Serviced offices are increasingly popular and therefore a business may not be paying business rates directly - the building owner is and this is incorporated in the office rental charge.

	Today’s high-tech products can contain hundreds or thousands of patented inventions resulting in Invention Gap™ exposure for technology companies. The Invention Gap—the difference between the invention rights companies own and the intellectual property (IP) assets they use—represents a strategic risk and potentially substantial financial liability. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, over the past 15 years, the annual median damages award for patent litigation in the U.S. has ranged from $2.4M to $10.5M—with single initial judgments as high as $1.8B. Together with our customers, Intellectual Ventures is Bridging the Invention Gap™ by significantly reducing liabilities and providing access to valuable invention rights.

Featured Case Study
We knew building a relationship with Intellectual Ventures would be the fastest, most cost-effective way to resolve the patent infringement suit against BlueCat Networks.

License Our Patents
Patented inventions and intellectual property are strategic assets in today’s business climate. At IV, we put our invention assets to work for our customers—helping them mitigate risk and attain competitive advantage.

Solutions





IP-for-Defense
The frequency with which high-tech companies are involved in patent infringement litigation and the cost to defend such litigation are increasing. IV’s patents can serve as counter-assertion for accused infringers, enabling more efficient negotiations to reduce liabilities and achieve favorable licensing terms.





IP Monetization
The costs for companies to maintain a large patent portfolio can challenge valuable financial resources and disrupt management focus. IV helps companies identify underutilized assets in their portfolio and helps monetize those assets in a variety of ways by leveraging our expertise and efficient licensing channels.





Litigation Clearance
Legal, settlement, and damage award costs are daunting for companies whether the litigation each faces is active, pending, or a future possibility. IV collaborates with tech companies, Bridging the Invention Gap™ by procuring and then licensing patents in litigation, efficiently clearing billions of dollars of exposed product revenue.





Strategic Buying
Identifying and acquiring patent rights within targeted technology areas of high importance and value helps companies reduce their Invention Gap exposure. But purchasing patent rights on the open market can be cost prohibitive for an individual company. Through the Strategic Buying process, IV pools resources to acquire these targeted assets and licenses them to our customers.

Who we are

Uniquely passionate entrepreneurs.
We back the best and most ambitious entrepreneurs and help them make their ideas real and lasting. The entrepreneurs we team up with were born to build their businesses -- it is their life’s mission. Working side-by-side with these visionaries makes us incredibly optimistic about the future. The transformative companies they’re building, include: Adyen, Dropbox, Etsy, Sonos, SoundCloud, King, BlaBlaCar, Squarespace, Just Eat, Lookout, Hortonworks, Pure Storage, Supercell, Criteo, Funding Circle and many others.
Full attention of our partnership.
To us, providing full-service means giving you the full attention of our partnership. We structurally de-emphasize individual partner achievements to provide you with the full partnerships’ collective experience and expertise. Access to one means access to all. As our founding partner, Gerald Rimer, likes to say, “We’re not a family business, we’re a business family.”
Global ambitions.
We believe that passionate entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. We’ve supported consumer and enterprise technology entrepreneurs in 39 cities around the world and have helped them as they grow into new regions. Our physical presence in San Francisco, London and Geneva serve as places where our entrepreneurs can come together, and as jumping off points to discover what’s next.
 






Our history

Founded in Geneva in 1996 by Neil Rimer, Giuseppe Zocco, David Rimer.
Principal offices: London and San Francisco.
Most recent funds: early-stage fund (Index Ventures 8) & growth fund (Index Growth 3).

India: Mergers, Acquisitions And Joint Venture: Trends In Bio-Similar Industries
Last Updated: 18 July 2017
Article by Vijaylaxmi  RathoreSingh & Associates
Your LinkedIn Connections at FirmMergers, acquisitions and joint ventures (M&As) amongst
businesses are well known trends and often considered critical for
the growth of a company. Additionally, M&As help to strengthen
and explore market opportunities, functional and financial synergy
along with ability to generate additional revenues. M&As
further encourage cross-cultural growth, transfer of technical
knowhow and administrative maturity and/or adaptation.
However, M&As do not always result in a success, especially
amongst companies with different objectives and scope of
businesses. At times companies tend to become overtly adamant
leading to operative challenges while also facing difficulties in
adapting to the cultural diversity in dissimilar markets.
Nevertheless, in today's time, it is imperative to have
M&As with the key players in an industry so as to grow and
eventually become market leaders.
A "merger" is a combination of two or more entities at
various degree into forming one entity. The result of merger is not
only accumulation of assets and liabilities of the entities but
also to form one business with the uniform objectives, finances,
access to technologies and shared markets. On the other hand, an
"acquisition" is a takeover by an acquirer entity by
virtue of controlling the share capital, assets and/or liabilities
of the target or acquired entity. Lastly, "joint
ventures" are coming together of two or more businesses for a
purpose such as entering into a new business and/or new expertise,
or for investments, which may or may not be for a limited
duration.
The different forms of mergers are explained under Competition
Act, 2002:

Horizontal Merger- The merging
entities are from the similar industries. This merger supports
merged entity towards monopoly by removing competitor. As far as
the competition concern this merger is performed under competition
commission.
Vertical Merger- The merging entities
are at different stage even though from similar industries. This
merger supports merged entity towards greater independence and self
sufficiency.
Congeneric Merger- The merging
entities with different customer-relationship even though from
interrelated industries. This merger supports merged entity's
market growth by using aggregated customer relationship.
Conglomerate Merger- The merging
entities are from the different industries. This merger results in
support for the merged entity by financial resources and increased
market value.
Cash Merger- The shareholder of one
entity receives cash instead of shares and exit from the merged
entity.
Triangular Merger- This is a
tri-partite arrangement as a target merges with a subsidiary of
acquirer and vice versa, also called triangular
mergers.

Mergers, Acquisitions and Joint ventures in BIOSIMILAR
Industries:
A "biosimilar" is a biological drug that has similar
pharmaceutical standards, safety and efficacy profile
vis-ŕ-vis an approved reference biological molecule.
However, unlike generics, biosimilars do not have structural
similarities or they do not form replica of the original molecule.
A biopharmaceutical entity dedicated to developing, manufacturing
and marketing of the biosimilars as part of its therapeutic
portfolio is called a Biosimilar Entity.
In contemporary times, the increased demand of biosimilars is
not only beneficial to the Biosimilar entities, but also offers
more viable options to the consumers or patients requiring
treatment especially for diseases like cancer, cardiovascular
disorders, arthritis, etc. Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in
Biosimilar industries are primary to strengthen the service, brand,
and patient accessibility for a certain drug. Moreover, Biosimilars
M&As also help to overcome challenges such as seeking
investments, research and development, process manufacturing,
marketing and/or distribution of biosimilars. Here are some of the
prominent M&As from biosimilar industries-
1. The Pfizer's acquisition of Hospira:
The acquisition of Hospira by Pfizer for $17 billion is one of
the biggest horizontal mergers in recent years and has been
approved conditionally by European Commission (EC) Merger
Regulation after investigating the competition concerns and
commitments offered by the merging companies6. Both
Pfizer and Hospira are US based industries, and global provider of
injectable, biosimilars and human pharmaceuticals respectively.
Therefore, the said acquisition helps Pfizer to expand its existing
generic injectable drugs range as well as access over the infusion
technology and new  category of biosimilars are collectively
expected to generate revenues of $800 million annually by
20187.
Hospira, Inc. is now a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. and the global
market for biosimilars is estimated to be approximately $20 billion
in 2020. However, Hospira's biosimilars and generics range
already helped to raise 11% revenues of Pfizer as reported on its
second quarter result after acquisitions8. Later Pfizer
started to take a bid from Hospira's few units and sites which
seem underutilized as a part of cost cutting and improvisation in
company performance. In later 2016, Pfizer sold out Hospira's
Infusion System (HIS) to ICU medical and also planning to close
Hospira's plant at Colorado9 and few sites at USA by
201910.
2. The ICU Medical's acquisition of Hospira from
Pfizer:
A deal between Pfizer and ICU Medical Inc. comes out as a cash
and stock deal, as ICU acquired Hospira's Infusion System (HIS)
having IV pumps, solutions, and devices from Pfizer, which
compliments ICU existing Intravenous product portfolio.
Consequently, ICU is expected to become a bigger player of
infusions by this deal with Hospira enhanced global marketing
platform. The deal is settled for $1 Billion by exchange of cash of
$600 million, $400 million newly issued shares of ICU Medical apart
from this Pfizer will nominate one member on ICU Medical's
board as long as it hold 10% of its equity11.
However, in January 2017 the definitive agreement between ICU
and Pfizer for Hospira Infusion System (HIS) has been revised, as
the latest performance report of HIS deviates as expected. Based on
the modified agreement the deal is settled for $900 million ($400
million in equity + $275 millions cash + $75 million seller note).
Pfizer may be receiving additional $225 based on the HIS
performance target till December 2019.
As per Mr. Vivek Jain, Chief Executive Officer, ICU Medical
"The combination of these two businesses is the natural
evolution of a productive relationship that began more than 20
years ago when Hospira began integrating ICU Medical needle free
technology into their infusion offering globally"
12.
3. Gedeon Richter acquisitions of Finox holding:
The Hungarian drugmaker Gedeon Richter acquire of Finox holding,
a Swiss Biotech firm for $ 190 million. Finox holding, a leading
producer of wide range female reproductive health products has
handed over the global right of Bemfola development and marketing
to Richter by this transaction. Bemfola is a recombinant-human
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (r-hFSH) biosimilar of Gonal-f, which
stimulates egg development in ovaries and suggested during in-vitro
fertilization. The global right of Bemfola includes the exclusive
marketing authorization in EU, presently counting 20 countries
where drug is being sold already, excluding marketing authorization
in USA13.
This acquisition helps Richter not only to strengthen and expand
its existing women healthcare portfolio by using Finox scientific
and managerial expertise. But, also to further expand its
dedication towards biosimilar development and commercialization.
The leading approach and expertise of Richter toward development
and marketing of female fertility product worldwide will definitely
get boost by Finox existing portfolio.
The leading Biopharmaceuticals are acquiring more firms, like GE
Healthcare acquisitions of Xcellerex Inc., Amgen acquires Onyx
Pharmaceuticals etc., with aim to monopolize and mark their
presence as leading player in health care industry.
4. The newer player: Aurobindo acquired four biosimilars from
TL Biopharmaceutical
Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., an Indian generic pharmaceutical industry
is expanding its diverse portfolio specifically the biosimilars
manufacturing by acquiring four licensed biosimilars from a swiss
firm TL Biopharmaceutical AG in undisclosed amount. Aurobindo
Pharma will get development, commercialization and marketing rights
of these Biosimilars, three out of four acquired products are
anticancer monoclonal antibodies, and one of lead molecule
bevacizumab from this transaction is expected to conduct a clinical
trial this year. Aurobindo will acquire eight more biosimilars in
future to strengthen its biosimilar
portfolio. The company has been building a biosimilar
manufacturing facility in Hyderabad. The transaction is a strategic
investment for future growth and will position Aurobindo as a
strong player in the rapidly evolving biosimilars landscape,
according to the company14.
Likewise Eagle Pharma acquires Arsia Therapeutics, Fresenius
Kabi acquisitions to Merck KGaA and many more new players are
making their entry to biosimilar portfolio by M&A.
CONCLUSION-
The primary goal of an M&A is to strengthen and expand the
functional and financial synergies of the merged entities while
also enabling exploration of new portfolios or business sectors for
the said entities. Further, at times M&A also results in market
leadership by merger of entities of same/similar industries. In
biosimilar industry, we see a considerable increase in coming
together of entities which has led to faster growth of the industry
and increased demand of biosimilars.
Biopharmaceutical firms often differ in functional, financial,
customer related services and other aspects. Therefore, the
conventional M&A gets modified at various levels and with mixed
ratios based on the interest areas and objectives of participating
entities, for e.g., The ICU Medical's acquisition of Hospira
from Pfizer is a mixed M&A.
Firms new to biosimilars such as Aurobindo, Eagle Pharma etc.,
are showing interest towards building and acquiring biosimilar
portfolio as a part of greater therapeutic coverage and to charter
the global markets. On the other hand, the leading producers of
biosimilars like- Sandoz, Teva Pharmaceutical, Amgen, Mylan, AbbVie
etc., are stepping slowly toward monopolization of the market by
M&A with promising biosimilar entities.
The trend of increased M&As in the biosimilar industry would
lead to advanced research & development in the sector and will
infuse competition amongst pharmaceutical firms which will
hopefully result in efficacious and safer biosimilar innovations
for diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

Information Collection and Use
We require site users to register with Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) to 
view the free information on the site. We also collect information from our 
users at several different points on the websites: this is so that we can 
customise the sites according to individual usage, provide 'session-aware' 
functionality, and ensure that content is acquired and developed appropriately. 
This gives us an overall picture of our user profiles, which in turn shows to 
our Editorial Contributors the type of person they are reaching by posting 
articles on Mondaq (and its affiliate sites)  meaning more free content for 
registered users. 
We are only able to provide the material on the Mondaq (and its affiliate 
sites) site free to site visitors because we can pass on information about the 
pages that users are viewing and the personal information users provide to us 
(e.g. email addresses) to reputable contributing firms such as law firms who 
author those pages. We do not sell or rent information to anyone else other than 
the authors of those pages, who may change from time to time. Should you wish us 
not to disclose your details to any of these parties, please tick the box above 
or tick the box marked "Opt out of Registration Information Disclosure" on the
