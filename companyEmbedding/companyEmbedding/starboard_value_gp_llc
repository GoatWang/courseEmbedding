NEW YORK, April 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered a letter to President and CEO, Jim Schoeneck, and the Depomed Board of Directors. 
The full text of the letter follows:








April 8, 2016
Depomed, Inc.   7999 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 300   Newark, CA 94560   Attn: Jim Schoeneck, President and Chief Executive Officer  
cc: Board of Directors
Dear Jim,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), has an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and that significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that should be within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board").  However, we are highly concerned regarding a number of actions that the Board has taken which indicate to us that meaningful change is needed to ensure the Company is acting in the best interest of all shareholders.  Specifically, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  In combination, these concerns lead us to believe that management and the Board may be more interested in entrenching themselves than in delivering maximum value for all shareholders.
As we will discuss in this letter and subsequent materials, yesterday we delivered to the Company the documentation required under Depomed's bylaws to request that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice").  We understand that we are taking extraordinary actions and are doing so because of our serious concerns with the Board's recent actions and long history of shareholder-unfriendly tactics.   
We acquired our position in Depomed because we believe that the Company is substantially undervalued and opportunities exist to create significant value for shareholders.  This includes an opportunity to improve capital deployment, rationalize research and development, and explore a potential sale of the Company given potential operating, financial, and tax synergies.  However, while still acquiring our position, Depomed filed preliminary proxy materials for the upcoming annual meeting with a proposal to change the Company's state of incorporation from California to Delaware (the "Reincorporation Proposal").  Upon further review, we identified unconventional provisions that indicate management and the Board are using the Reincorporation Proposal as a tactic to further entrench themselves by suppressing shareholder rights that currently exist under Depomed-California.  This is just the latest egregious example of poor corporate governance and entrenchment by this Board.  Apparently, it was not enough for the current Board to unilaterally adopt onerous and shareholder-unfriendly special meeting bylaw provisions in July 2015, as part of its efforts to fend off an unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company from Horizon Pharma plc ("Horizon").  Now, under the guise of the Reincorporation Proposal, the Board is attempting to:
(i) Increase the solicitation requirement to call a special meeting from 10% of the voting power, as it currently stands under California law, to 25% of the voting power, as would be required under Depomed-Delaware's bylaws; and
(ii) Eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting to remove and replace current Board members; and
(iii) Prevent shareholders, for all practical purposes, from commencing a special meeting request process within 180 days of any Annual Meeting; and
(iv) Obtain the sole discretion and authority to effect the Delaware reincorporation at any time prior to the 2017 Annual Meeting.
These are not typical or standard provisions that would reasonably be included in such a reincorporation proposal.  These appear to be carefully crafted provisions with the specific intention of further limiting shareholder rights.  In addition, Depomed conveniently failed to disclose some of these material provisions in the Reincorporation Proposal section of its preliminary proxy and instead chose to bury these significant entrenchment provisions in Appendices D and E towards the very end of the proxy.  We intend to vigorously oppose the current version of the Reincorporation Proposal, and we advise other shareholders to fully consider these provisions and the significant ramifications they would have on shareholder rights.
Unfortunately, these shareholder-unfriendly tactics are just the latest attempts by the current Board to further entrench themselves.  The Board took similar actions following Horizon's unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company.  Specifically, on July 7, 2015, the Company received an unsolicited offer from Horizon to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Depomed in an all-stock transaction for $29.25 per share, which represented a 42% premium to the closing price of $20.64 per share on July 6, 2015.  At the time, this $29.25 per share offer price would have represented an all-time high stock price for the Company, and compares to the current Depomed stock price of $15.00 per share as of yesterday's close.
Rather than engage with Horizon in an attempt to negotiate a value-maximizing transaction, on July 12, 2015, the Board adopted bylaw amendments, as well as a 10% poison pill rights plan (the "Poison Pill"), designed to make it as difficult and time-consuming as possible for shareholders to potentially have a say on Horizon's offer at a special meeting.  Nevertheless, Horizon proceeded to comply with the arduous steps under the special meeting bylaw amendments in order to give shareholders a voice on its offer.  Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass, Lewis & Co. ("Glass Lewis"), two leading proxy advisory firms, expressed concerns about Depomed's shareholder-unfriendly bylaw amendments and Poison Pill, and supported Horizon's efforts to call a special meeting to remove and replace the Board, noting:
"Given that the poison pill and unilateral bylaw amendments adopted by the Depomed board materially impact shareholder rights, shareholders should provide consent FOR the special meeting requests." – ISS, September 26, 2015
"[i]n this case, [Glass Lewis] believe[s] it would be in the best interests of [Depomed] shareholders to consent to the calling of the Removal and Bylaw Amendments Special Meeting and the Election Special Meeting so that the merits of the underlying issues can be more carefully evaluated." – Glass Lewis, September 28, 2015
In early August 2015, Horizon's merger subsidiary filed a lawsuit against Depomed and the Board, seeking to invalidate the bylaw amendments and the Poison Pill under California law and alleging that the Board members had breached their fiduciary duties.  That same day, Depomed filed a lawsuit against Horizon alleging, among other things, a breach of contract and other violations of California law by Horizon based on Horizon's possession and misuse of confidential information it obtained from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Janssen") under a confidentiality agreement.  Depomed moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent Horizon from continuing with its offer to acquire Depomed based on Horizon's alleged misuse of confidential information, which the court granted on November 19, 2015.  Despite the onerous bylaw requirements, Horizon was close to submitting the requisite consents for calling the special meeting in mid-November 2015.  Following the court decision, however, Horizon withdrew its then-increased offer of $33.00 per share.  Depomed stock reached a high of $33.74 on July 21, 2015 following Horizon's final offer.  Since then, Depomed's stock price has declined 56%, resulting in significant losses for shareholders.
In addition to the decline in Depomed's share price, shareholders are continuing to pay for the Company's ill-advised lawsuit against Horizon.  In 2015, Depomed paid approximately $11.9 million in legal fees associated with the defense of Horizon.  Shareholders are still paying the Company's legal fees as Depomed continues a lawsuit that appears to have more to do with management and the Board's self-preservation than protecting the best interests of shareholders.  We see no legitimate rationale for the Board's continued insistence in proceeding with a lawsuit that deprives shareholders of the potential for an approach by a strategic acquirer.  This lawsuit sets a terrible precedent for potential future value creation, and significantly undermines the rights of Depomed shareholders.
This Company has a troubling record of manipulating Depomed's corporate machinery to entrench management and the Board.  This was clearly evident throughout Horizon's attempt to acquire the Company and has become even more evident with regard to Depomed's latest attempt to eliminate altogether the ability of shareholders to seek the removal of Board members at a special meeting under the guise of a Delaware reincorporation. 
Given the apparent willingness of the current Board members to take extraordinary action to entrench themselves, as exemplified by the Reincorporation Proposal, we have little choice at this time but to immediately commence the process to call a special meeting of shareholders in order to preserve our rights under California law and Depomed's current bylaws.  Therefore, yesterday, we delivered to the Company the documentation required under Depomed's bylaws to request that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice").  Depomed's onerous special meeting bylaws require that we put forth our slate of director candidates as part of this initial step in commencing the special meeting process.
Given that the Reincorporation Proposal was publicly disclosed only three days ago on April 5, 2016, and our view that the members of the Board will go to any length to entrench themselves, out of an abundance of caution, we are immediately nominating six individuals, five of whom are Starboard Value investment professionals.  We intend to continue our search for a slate of director candidates that will ensure an experienced, diverse, and independent board, as has been our practice when proposing alternative board slates over the past fourteen years.  However, we deemed it necessary to take this action to preserve our rights as shareholders, and to ensure compliance with Depomed's current onerous bylaw requirements, so that management cannot further manipulate the bylaws prior to our ability to take action.
We are taking this extraordinary action because we cannot risk that the current Board may seek to further manipulate Depomed's bylaws to prevent a lawful special meeting request.  We caution the Board against taking any steps in response to our special meeting Record Date Request Notice to further diminish or suppress the rights of its shareholders to call a special meeting under California law and the Company's bylaws.
We have an ownership interest in approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed because we believe that significant opportunities exist to create value through better execution, improved capital allocation, and, potentially, a sale of the Company.  We hope to have a constructive dialogue with the Company, but need to make sure that shareholders' interests remain of paramount importance.  As such, we fully expect that management and the Board will halt their pattern of aggressive entrenchment behavior and take no action to further frustrate shareholders' rights. Additionally, despite recent rhetoric from management to the contrary, we believe that Depomed should not be contemplating acquisitions at this time given its levered capital structure and expensive debt.
To be clear, we are not currently advocating for any one particular transaction, or any transaction at all, but we firmly believe that board change is necessary to best represent the interests of all shareholders as it relates to the ongoing business and any potential transaction opportunities in the future.  Given your actions, and history of actions, we cannot take the risk that you further impair our shareholder rights.  We intend to share more details with shareholders in the coming weeks regarding our views on the Company, opportunities for value creation, and Depomed's significant corporate governance deficiencies.

to which the Issuer and Starboard agreed that (i) the size of the Issuer’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) shall
be set at seven (7) directors effective immediately prior to the commencement of the Issuer’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders

and among Depomed, Inc. (the “Company”) and the entities and natural persons set forth in the signature pages
hereto (collectively, “Starboard”) (each of the Company and Starboard, a “Party” to this
Amendment, and collectively, the “Parties”).
RECITALS
WHEREAS, the Parties
entered into that certain Cooperation and Support Agreement dated March 28, 2017 (the “Agreement”);
WHEREAS, the Parties
wish to amend the Agreement as set forth herein.
NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:

1.2017 Board of Director Nominees. The Company and Starboard hereby agree that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement, (i) the Company’s slate of nominees for election as directors of the
Company at the Company’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2017 Annual Meeting”) shall consist
of seven Directors (the “2017 Slate”), (ii) the members of the 2017 Slate shall be Karen Dawes, Mr. James Fogarty,
Mr. Arthur Higgins, Mr. Louis Lavigne, Mr. William McKee, Mr. Peter Staple and Mr. James Tyree and (iii) effective immediately
prior to the commencement of the 2017 Annual Meeting, the size of the board shall be set at seven.

2.Appointment as Observer. The Company and Starboard hereby agree that following the 2017
Annual Meeting, Mr. Molinelli, during the Period (as defined in the Agreement) shall have the right to serve as a non-voting observer
(an “Observer”) to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). As an Observer, Mr.
Molinelli will (i) receive copies of all notices and written information furnished to the full Board in connection with each meeting,
reasonably in advance of such meeting to the extent practicable, and (ii) be permitted to be present at, but not vote at, all meetings
of the full Board (whether by telephone or in person). The Company shall be entitled to withhold any information and exclude Mr.
Molinelli from any meeting, or any portion thereof, (x) that is an executive session of the Board, (y) as is reasonably determined
by the Company to be necessary to protect the Company’s attorney-client privilege, or (z) that relates to matters as to which
the Company reasonably determines that there may be a conflict of interest between Mr. Molinelli or Starboard on the one hand,
and the Company on the other hand. As a condition to Mr. Molinelli serving as an Observer, Mr. Molinelli shall deliver an undertaking
to the Company agreeing to comply with all policies, procedures, processes, codes, rules, standards and guidelines applicable to
Board members, including the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, securities trading policies, anti-hedging policies,
Regulation FD-related policies, director confidentiality policies and corporate governance guidelines. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Mr. Molinelli, if he wishes to do so, may provide confidential information of the Company which Mr. Molinelli learns in his capacity
as an Observer to the Board, including discussions or matters considered in meetings of the Board or Board committees (collectively,
“Company Confidential Information”), to Starboard, its Affiliates and Associates (each as defined in the Agreement)
and legal counsel (collectively, “Starboard Representatives”), in each case solely to the extent such Starboard
Representatives need to know such information in connection with Starboard’s investment in the Company; provided,
however, that Starboard (i) shall inform such Starboard Representatives of the confidential nature of any such Company Confidential
Information and (ii) shall cause such Starboard Representatives to refrain from disclosing such Company Confidential Information
to anyone (whether to any company in which Starboard has an investment or otherwise), by any means, or otherwise from using the
information in any way other than in connection with Starboard’s investment in the Company. Mr. Molinelli and Starboard shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Company, otherwise disclose any Company Confidential Information to any other person
or entity.
 
 


3.Miscellaneous. Except as specifically provided for in this Amendment, all of the terms of
the Agreement shall remain unchanged and are hereby confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms and provisions of
Sections 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 15 of the Agreement are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein and shall apply mutatis
mutandis to this Amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, so long as Starboard beneficially owns in the aggregate at least the
lesser of (x) 3.0% of the Company’s then outstanding Common Stock and (y) 1,862,986 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment
for stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar adjustments) as of the date that Mr. Molinelli no longer serves as
a director of the Company, Starboard shall have the right to recommend a substitute person to serve on the Board in place of Mr.
Molinelli in accordance with Section 1(a)(iv) of the Agreement, and the Company shall take whatever actions may be required by
Section 1(a)(iv) of the Agreement in connection with any such replacement director, and shall if necessary increase the size of
the Board.

NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed") (NASDAQ:   DEPO), with beneficial ownership of approximately 9.8% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders.  Starboard also announced that as of this past Friday it has delivered to Depomed more than the required consents to call a Special Meeting of Depomed shareholders and has set November 15, 2016 as the date for the Special Meeting.  








The full text of Starboard's letter to Depomed shareholders follows:
September 19, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard") and director nominees, currently owns approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders. Unfortunately, a series of shareholder-unfriendly actions by the Board over the past two years have led us to conclude that management and the Board are not acting in the best interest of all shareholders. We therefore continue to believe it is necessary to make substantial changes to the composition of the Board as soon as possible so that steps can be taken to create value for the benefit of all shareholders.
As you may recall, we initiated the process to call a special meeting of shareholders (the "Special Meeting") on April 7, 2016 and, subsequently, on July 26, 2016, announced that we would proceed with a consent solicitation to call the Special Meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under Depomed's Bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least 10% of Depomed's outstanding shares entitled to vote. As of Friday, we delivered to Depomed more than the required consents and have therefore initiated the calling of the Special Meeting to be held on November 15, 2016.  
We continue to have significant concerns that Depomed's Board is not looking out for the best interests of shareholders.  This was first evident during Horizon Pharma plc's ("Horizon") attempt to acquire the Company and was then reaffirmed by the Board's stealthy attempt to strip certain important shareholder rights earlier this year under the guise of a Delaware reincorporation proposal.  We have been steadfast that in light of these egregious actions, the Company clearly needs a new Board to ensure that shareholders' rights are properly and fully represented. 
Based on recent press reports, it appears that Depomed may have hired bankers to explore a sale.  As we have outlined publicly, we believe Depomed would be extremely attractive to numerous potential acquirers, and while there exists an opportunity to significantly improve operations at the Company, an outright sale may be the best option for unlocking shareholder value.  However, we remain extremely concerned that any potential sale process may not be undertaken with genuine intent, but rather as a smokescreen to distract from the required Board changes we are seeking and protect the current Board's positions beyond the Special Meeting.  We also do not trust the current Board to steward any sale process given the lengths the Board went to rebuff the approach by Horizon in 2015.  
Following the Board's mishandling of the Horizon acquisition proposal, it is imperative that any sale process be squarely focused on maximizing value for all shareholders.  Depomed refused to engage with Horizon despite its $33 per share offer at a 60% premium, and despite having expressed a willingness to raise the deal price. According to a proxy filing made by Horizon in November 2015, Horizon and its advisors reached out to Depomed to attempt to engage in acquisition discussions on more than 20 different occasions and not once did Depomed or its advisors meaningfully engage with Horizon. Instead, this Board not only avoided Horizon, but also unilaterally amended the Bylaws to make it extremely difficult for shareholders to have their voices heard on Horizon's offer, sued Horizon and adopted a Poison Pill. Is this the type of Board you can trust to conduct a robust sale process to maximize the value of your investment?
Unfortunately, according to recent press reports, the Company's actions regarding Horizon appear to be eerily similar to multiple other recent potential suitors who have reached out to try to engage with the Company on numerous occasions only to be rebuffed.  Clearly, the Company has a history of refusing to engage with potential suitors and not acting in the best interests of shareholders.  Press reports state that the Company has not yet begun a sale process but may do so in the future.  We have little confidence that the Company will begin a thorough and genuine process that includes all potential suitors in a manner designed to successfully maximize value for all shareholders.  Therefore, we believe that it is necessary for directors proposed by Starboard to be involved in any sale process at the Board level to ensure that the Board is actually and capably representing the best interests of shareholders and that value is maximized.
Record DateWe have been advised that Depomed has notified Broadridge Financial Solutions of a September 27, 2016 record date for the Special Meeting.  It is crucial that shareholders take whatever steps may be needed with their custodial banks and brokerage firms to ensure that they have the ability to vote their shares at the Special Meeting. 
It is important for shareholders to understand that while we firmly believe a change of the majority of the Board is warranted, we do not practically have any other option for seeking Board composition changes at the Special Meeting but to seek the removal of the entire Board.  This is because certain provisions under California law and the Company's Bylaws make it extremely difficult, if not virtually impossible, to remove any fewer than all of the Company's directors.  Effectively, if shareholders were to vote against the removal of even just one Depomed director at the Special Meeting, then a director-protecting cumulative voting provision is triggered with respect to every other director, thereby making the voting threshold required to remove any directors extraordinarily high and virtually impracticable.
In light of these unfortunate technical factors combined with the serious governance and operational deficiencies at Depomed, we intend to vigorously pursue replacement of the entire Board to ensure that Depomed is being run in a manner consistent with the best interests of all shareholders.  Over the coming weeks leading up to the Special Meeting we will be sharing additional details on our concerns regarding the serious corporate governance issues, questionable capital allocation decisions, and actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of all shareholders.
As we progress towards the Special Meeting, we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be elected as the new Board of Depomed, including our highly qualified advisors who would be invited to join the new Board if we are successful.  We believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise.  Collectively, our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards.  Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the Special Meeting, together with our highly qualified advisors, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.  We have provided summary biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below.
ContinuityIn addition, in order to maintain a degree of continuity on the new Board, in the event that the current Board is removed and our nominees are elected at the Special Meeting, the new Board would be willing to increase the size of the Board to eleven members and add back up to three incumbent directors.  As a reminder, we utilized this construct successfully at Darden Restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board members.
We look forward to sharing additional details on our plans for Depomed and engaging with you over the coming weeks as we approach the Special Meeting.  As one of the largest shareholders of the Company, our interests are directly aligned with yours.  We firmly believe that our proposed changes are in the best interest of all shareholders.
