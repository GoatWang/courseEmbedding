attractive pictures




By Mae, Mar 19 2014

My 18mo daughter loves reading the book. She loves the pictures and all the colourful worms. Unfortunately, the pages fell apart after we read it only for couple of time. Thats the only down side of the book.

Shortlisted 2012 Australian Christian Book of the Year




By 2012 Australian Christian Book of the Year judges, Aug 12 2013

Shan Joseph uses vivid colours and simple rhyme to awaken the imagination of preschool readers. The colour worms help children to learn by observation and together with parents acknowledge God as the loving creator of all that we see.

Summary

This touching computer–illustrated story of the day Jesus encountered Zacchaeus is a fun way to introduce children aged 4–8 to the Jesus who came to save even the most undeserving and lost. Jesus Meets Zacchaeus shows children that Jesus loves them and came to save them, just as he did Zacchaeus. Uniquely computer–illustrated by Shan Joseph, the Little Jesus Books are a fun way to introduce little lives to our Saviour King and his love for them. Perfect as gifts, the square–shaped books delight children with their bright colours and cartoon–like artwork.
