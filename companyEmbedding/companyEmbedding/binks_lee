Female Calisthenics Workout



          14,443 views
        

            2 years ago
          



          This video is to show case the moves that I have been able to achieve through basic body weight and calisthenic exercises. I started trying to be able to do a pull in January of 2014 and this video what taken close to the end of the year. Moves included in the video are the basic pull ups, push ups, stepping, type writers, weighted movements, side to side pull ups, swinging and L-pull ups as well as dragon flies and up side down sit ups.I am a bald female fitness athlete who is currently training for IBFF and Nabba, having won  body beautiful in South africa as well as coming first at WPF regionals and second at nationals. I still have a long way to go but have enjoyed to journey so far. I never thought I would ever get a six pack and be able to perform gymnastic moves of any sort. I am inspired by people like Frank Medrano and the Kings of Calisthenics. I really enjoy bar work and being able to exercise without the need for a gym. most of my workouts are done at home with us often welding things together to make frame works to train off of. Females that have constantly inspired along my journey include Dana Lynn Bailey, Paige Hathaway, Andreia Brazier and Competitors from everything from WBFF to IFBB. Basic body weight and calisthenics exercise video by Lee Binks Fitness. )Please like and share my fitness page www.facebook.com/leebinksfitness) Showing basic movements that you can do anywhere that has a bar, for people who dont have a gym membership but would like to get a but of fitness into their day.

HVLP

 

HVLP - Paint Spray Guns
Similar to air spray gun in that it uses pneumatic fluid atomization except HVLP uses a higher volume of air at a lower pressure. The lower pneumatic pressure allows for less overspray. HVLP spray guns are commonly used in the automotive, general metal, aerospace, architectural coating, furniture finishing, and other fine finishing applications where material waste is of a great concern. HVLP spray guns are often required by U.S. Enviromental Agencies for high usage customers. HVLP spray guns come in a variety configurations; siphon feed, gravity feed, and pressure feed.

Advantages:  High transfer efficiency (65% to 75%). Sprays well into recesses and cavities.
Limitations: Uses a high volume of air. Atomization not as fine as air spray guns.

 
HVLP, or High-Volume/Low Pressure, uses a high volume of air (typically between 10-26 CFM) delivered at low pressure (10 PSI or less at the air cap) to atomize paint into a soft, low-velocity pattern of particles. In many cases, less than 10 psi is needed in order to atomize. Proper setup utilizes no more fluid and air pressure than is needed to produce the required quality and a flow rate that will meet production requirements. As a result, far less material is lost in overspray, bounceback and blowback than with conventional air spray. This is why HVLP delivers dramatically higher transfer efficiency (the amount of paint that adheres to the substrate compared to the amount of paint sprayed) than spray systems using a higher atomizing pressure. The HVLP spray gun resembles a standard spray gun in shape and operation. HVLP is growing in popularity and new environmental regulations are requiring it for many applications. HVLP can be used with a wide variety of materials, including two-component paints, urethanes, acrylics, epoxies, enamels, lacquers, stains, primers, etc.
