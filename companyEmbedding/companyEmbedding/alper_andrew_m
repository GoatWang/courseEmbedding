President of the New York City Economic Development Corporation[edit]
Mr. Alper was appointed as President on January 15, 2002 by New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In his time as President, Mr. Alper worked with the Mayor's Office to encourage industrial expansion, business development, and employment opportunities in New York City.[1] He was also actively involved in the planning for the redevelopment of the site of the former World Trade Center.
Goldman, Sachs & Company[edit]
Before joining the NYCEDC, Mr. Alper was employed by Goldman, Sachs & Company since 1981. Mr. Alper started work there as a corporate finance generalist before becoming the youngest partner in firm history at the time in 1990. He also served as the Vice President and then the Managing Director of Goldman, Sachs & Co.'s finance department.[2] In 1997 he became the Chief Operation Officer of the company's global investment banking business.
Involvement with the University of Chicago[edit]
Alper has also been actively involved with his alma mater: the University of Chicago. He received his A.B. from The College of the University of Chicago in 1980, concentrating in economics, and his M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (Chicago Booth) in 1981.[3] As an undergraduate in the College, Mr. Alper resided in Pierce Hall and enjoyed working on a free weekly South Side newspaper he created: The Chicago Journal.[4] He also met his wife at that University during Orientation Week with whom he has two children, Karen and Jennifer Alper.
Since graduating, he has been an active alumnus, receiving a Young Alumni Service Citation in 1993. He was appointed to the Alumni Association Board of Governors in 1994 and served as the board's Vice President from 1996 to 1998. Since that time, he has served on the Chicago Booth Council and is currently the co-chair of Chicago Booth's Capital Campaign.[5]
Currently, Alper is a member of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees[6] and the Chairman of the completed Chicago Initiative,[7] a University fundraising drive to raise $2 billion for Chicago's endowment.
He is also the namesake of Alper House in the University of Chicago House System. Alper House is located on the third and fourth floors of the Max Palevsky East Residential Commons.

NYCEDC President Andrew M. Alper Joins Catalyst Advisory Board


December 05, 2005 

Will Lend Expertise to Develop London’s Bioscience Industry.Andrew M. Alper, President of the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), has been appointed to the leadership council of Catalyst, the group responsible for promoting London as a world leader in science, technology, design and innovation. Mr. Alper was selected as the council’s sole U.S. representative for his experience in leading New York City’s efforts to expand its bioscience sector and to exchange knowledge which will help both cities in further expanding their respective bioscience sectors.  “I am delighted to announce the addition of Andrew Alper to London’s Catalyst leadership council,” said Sir Richard Sykes, Catalyst Chairman, Rector of Imperial College in London and former Chairman of Galxo Smith Kline. “His experience and knowledge gained while developing New York City’s bioscience industry will serve our long-term interest in positioning London as one of Europe’s leading centers for scientific research and development.”  “A key objective of New York City’s economic development strategy has been to diversify the economy and create new jobs,” said Mr. Alper. “Bioscience is one of the best opportunities to achieve this goal. Over the last four years, New York City has worked to grow the sector by reaching out to the major organizations in the bioscience industry. I am happy to bring this experience to the council and look forward to bringing innovative ideas back from London so that we can further accelerate the growth of New York’s thriving commercial bioscience sector.” Mr. Alper added, “Catalyst represents a further opportunity for closer collaboration between both cities’ commercial, financial, academic and medical institutions.”  Catalyst is part of London Mayor Ken Livingston’s vision to promote the city’s economic growth by widening choices for industries and individuals and improving the way current and future needs are met. The council is supported by the London Development Agency (LDA), London universities and several leading corporations. About NYCEDC  New York City Economic Development Corporation is the City’s primary vehicle for promoting economic growth in each of the five boroughs. NYCEDC’s mission is to stimulate job growth through expansion and redevelopment programs that encourage investment, generate prosperity and strengthen the City’s competitive position. NYCEDC serves as an advocate to the business community by building relationships with companies that allow them to take advantage of New York City’s many opportunities. About Catalyst  Catalyst is a three–year program to promote London as a center for science, design and business, investigate the need for major scientific infrastructure in London (science parks), and improve the access and collaboration among universities and business. The council’s mission is to ensure that London maintains its global competitiveness across a variety of industry sectors, including biopharmaceuticals, healthcare, energy and the environment, and financial services.
