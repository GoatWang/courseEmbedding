Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

Bankruptcy
                      

IRAs and qualified plans have somewhat different rules regarding bankruptcy and creditor protection.
                      


 If an investor faces insolvency, he or she can look to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) for guidance on retirement assets that are shielded from federal bankruptcy. Effective for bankruptcies filed on or after 10/17/2005, all retirement accounts are protected in the event of individual bankruptcy, whether or not the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is applicable. This protection is also extended to IRAs. It is intended to shield retirement assets from creditors and prevents a participant's bankruptcy from causing the investor to lose assets that have been set aside for retirement.

Beneficiary
                      

Spouse? Non-spouse? Non-person? All can be named as IRA beneficiaries, but tax treatment can be very different.
                      


Naming a beneficiary using a beneficiary form provided by or accepted by the IRA custodian is very important. Why? What's written on the beneficiary designation form, not contained within the investor's will, determines who inherits the IRA. In other words, IRAs do not pass through probate.

                      Estate Tax
                      
                    
Like all assets, IRAs must be considered as part of the estate plan. But to whom the account is left can make a significant difference.
                      


Estate planning is critical to preserving wealth for future generations. The estate tax or "death tax" is a federal and or state tax placed on a decedent's asset transfer. A gross estate includes the value of all property in which the decedent had an interest at the time of death, including employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs. Whether an estate will be subject to estate taxes depends on the year of death, the gross estate's value, the amount of debt, the expense of settling the estate, and any available deductions.

IRA versus Qualified Plan Beneficiary Rules
                      

Are there different rules when it comes to naming an IRA beneficiary versus a qualified plan beneficiary?
                      


By law, qualified plans, such as a 401(k)s, require the participant's spouse to be the designated 100% beneficiary. In order for a married 401(k) plan participant to name any other person as beneficiary, the spouse must waive his or her rights as beneficiary in writing, and most plans require that any spousal waiver be witnessed by a notary public. In addition, a new beneficiary must be named.

Naming a Trust
                      

Why would an IRA account owner want to name a trust or non-person as a beneficiary?
                      


One type of frequently used trust is called a "see-through" trust. It creates a mechanism for the deceased to control account withdrawals, post-death. In addition, a see-through trust allows the underlying beneficiary to "stretch" distributions over their life expectancy. Prior to naming a trust as a beneficiary, an investor needs to be aware of the complex rules that govern trust beneficiaries.

When appreciated company stock is a portion of a retirement plan distribution, recipients may benefit by transferring the shares to a brokerage account while rolling the non-stock assets to an IRA. A special provision known as net unrealized appreciation (NUA) allows a plan participant to potentially take advantage of lower tax rates.
The NUA tax break on lump-sum distributions from a qualified plan allows participants to trade ordinary federal income tax rates1 (39.6% top marginal bracket in 2016) for long-term capital gains treatment (maximum of 20%). To take advantage, a participant would transfer his/her company stock to a brokerage account (non-IRA) paying ordinary income tax on the amount the stock cost (basis) only. Subsequently, when sold, the stock would be subject to long-term capital gains rates, currently 15% or 20% depending on income. Long-term capital gains treatment applies even if the stock is sold prior to being held for one year.
To be eligible to receive NUA tax-treatment, a number of specific rules need to be followed including:

Distribution must qualify as a “lump-sum.”
Distribution must be due to certain events including: 59½ (if plan permits), separation from service, retirement.


Assuming you NUA-qualify, you will not pay current income tax on the stock appreciation. Instead, in the year of distribution you would be subject to income tax on the basis only. However, depending on age and when separation occurs, there may be a 10% penalty in addition to paying ordinary income tax on the amount of basis placed in the brokerage. As shares are sold, only capital gains2 taxes apply to the shares sold, so the individual would then pay tax on the appreciation of the shares above the cost basis at a long-term, capital gains2 rate based on the initial transfer. It does not matter how long the shares were owned during plan participation.
Please consult an IRA specialist at 888-522-2388 for additional information.
This information is not intended to be tax or legal advice. For more information on this topic, contact your legal or tax advisor.

1 Income taxes can be postponed until a later date; examples include IRAs and 401(k) plan earnings.
2 An increase in the value of a capital asset, such as a mutual fund or a common stock. If the asset is sold, the gain is a realized capital gain, which may be either short term (one year or less) or long term (more than one year).







There may be fees, expenses, taxes, and penalties associated with early IRA withdrawals.
Lord Abbett will waive (or otherwise pay) the yearly $10.00 custodial fee that would be charged each year on an ongoing basis to every new IRA account and, therefore, will not assess a custodial account fee in 2016 or any year afterward. Fund level fees and expenses are still applicable. Please see the current prospectus.




To comply with Treasury Department regulations, we inform you that, unless otherwise expressly indicated, any tax information contained herein is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties that may be imposed under the Internal Revenue Code or any other applicable tax law, or (ii) promoting, marketing, or recommending to another party any transaction, arrangement, or other matter.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

With one more downgrade, Illinois’s general obligation bonds could become the first junk-rated debt of any state since 1970. But default risk still remains low.

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]
