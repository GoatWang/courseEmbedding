Select Equity Group, L.P.

                                    Select Equity Group (SEG) offers a long-only equity management program that utilizes fundamental analysis to select stocks they believe will provide better than market returns over a complete market cycle. Money market reserves may comprise 0% to 50% of the account, but generally range from 0% to 20%, depending on market conditions. SEG generally limits their portfolio of securities to less than 40 than stocks in each account. SEG does not generally attempt to “time” the market or to predict overall macro-economic trends. Instead, they seek to make investments in good businesses with strong managements that they believe are inefficiently valued by the markets. SEG employs eight primary investment strategies. Approximately 85% of the firm's AUM are invested in US and foreign equities. Their investment strategies are generally driven by a research-intensive, fundamental bottom-up process and draw upon a centralized research department. These strategies include: Small-Mid Cap /Long-Only: US Core: Concentrated Global; US Long/Short; International Long/Short; International Long-Only; Global Long-Only: and Private Equity. SEG obtains exposure to particular issuers or securities for their private funds (and may for individual clients) through various types of derivatives transactions, including swaps and contracts for differences. In addition, they may hedge exposure to currency fluctuations for foreign securities owned by the private funds by entering into currency forward or option transactions..
