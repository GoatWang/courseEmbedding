Customer Questions & Answers








            Can this cord use for Ridge generator RD906812B, Running Watts 6800W and Start Watts 8500W
        


Asked by: KJSS

            As we only manufacture our products for use with other Generac brand products, we are unable to confirm whether or not a particular accessory is compatible with a generator produced by an alternative manufacturer.
            Answered by: Generac
Date published: 2015-09-20




            Will this 100 ft extension support Champion generator(9375 starting Watts, and 7500 continouse Watts)? Will the 100 ft extension reduce AMP and Volt?
        


Asked by: Joseph

            Generac&rsquo;s 100 foot, 30 Amp, 7500-Watt Generator Cord is manufactured for use with Generac generators. We as the manufacturer cannot comment on the part&rsquo;s compatibility with another brand&rsquo;s products, as we have not tested them for such use. We recommend contacting the manufacturer of your generator to inquire about the compatibility of this particular part and your personal generator.
            Answered by: Generac

            When will the Generac 100' 30 amp generator power cord be back in stock?
        

            Model 6388 Internet number 203835717

Can I be put on a waiting list
        
Asked by: Anonymous

            Due to demand created by the recent storms, certain products may be on backorder. We recommend contacting your local store directly for estimated timeframe on availability, as each store&rsquo;s stock and orders will vary.

Once you get over the sticker shock, this is a well made product that is going to last a long time. I used this with a mating outdoor receptable box and a little bit of in-house wiring to make it very easy to run (most of) my household loads on my newly acquired portable generator.

6388 5 Ft roller bunks, galv  (Back to product)




Home  » Trailer » Roller Bunks  


Product ID: 217416388 5 Ft roller bunks, galv 



				 				


   


Deluxe 5-foot roller bunks (pair) attach directly to 2 x 4 bunk boards, or can be mounted with 6389 brackets (sold separately). A quick, easy and inexpensive way to upgrade bunk trailers to rollers. 12 gauge steel, galvanized finish, rubber rollers.                                                          For boats weighing up to 3000 lbs. The advantage of this style of roller bunks is that each set of rollers is wider (3 rollers instead of 2), providing more contact with the boat. The rollers on this style of bunk do not have wobble capability for self-alignment like model 6355 does.   The rated capacity is based on having good contact with all of the rollers, and a reasonably even distribution of weight on the rollers. Rollers must be in contact with straight sections of the boat hull.                               It is critical to avoid a very large load on the first set of rollers during the unloading and loading process. The boat should float at least part way onto the trailer before contacting rollers, so that all of its weight is not concentrated on the first set of rollers. A concentrated load can crush a single set of rollers, with the potential for damage to the boat hull.
