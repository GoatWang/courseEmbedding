NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Nov. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Terra Tech Corp. (OTCQX: TRTC) ("Terra Tech" or the "Company"), a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company, today announced the appointment of Kenneth P. Krueger to the Board of Directors.
Mr. Krueger has over 48 years of experience in the financial industry, having co-founded Canterbury Consulting in 1988 and served as its Chairman of the Board, Chief Financial Officer, and Head of Compliance. Canterbury Consulting is an investment office for foundations, endowments, healthcare organizations, religious organizations, and corporate plans, overseeing more than $14 billion in funds. Ken's experience in making strategic, financial, and capacity decisions to optimize investment return will be a positive addition to Terra Tech as it continues to execute on its growth strategy.
"The addition of Mr. Krueger to our Board of Directors is part of our long-term goal of establishing IVXX™ as the leading, premium medical cannabis brand in the world, as well as improving the quality of our corporate governance practices and increasing the independence of our Board," said Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech. "The leadership and entrepreneurial experience he brings to the table will help guide our strategic vision as we work to transform the cannabis space." 
Prior to joining Canterbury Consulting, Mr. Krueger advised individual clients through customized financial strategies at Kidder, Peabody & Co., a U.S.-based securities firm that was sold to General Electric in 1986. Before that, he was employed by Dean Witter & Company, where he supervised brokers, provided outside seminars, and identified potential clients for the firm.
"I'm excited to be a part of a company that's at the forefront of a fast-growing, nascent industry," said Mr. Krueger. "I look forward to helping Terra Tech continue to establish itself in the market and create additional value to its stockholders."
Mr. Krueger also served at IBM, where he created and implemented sales and marketing strategies for data processing systems. He holds a degree in Marketing from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, completed graduate work at the University of Southern California, and served in the U.S. Coast Guard Reserves until 1972.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment.

                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
