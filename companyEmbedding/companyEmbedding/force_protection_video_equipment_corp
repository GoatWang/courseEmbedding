P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

LET’S GO TO THE VIDEO!








EXPERIENCE

Force Protection Video has over 30 years experience in providing and designing quality video/audio equipment for law enforcement and military.
In March 2015, the Company placed an order with a manufacturer in China for 1,000 LE10 Camera System action cameras, some of which were delivered in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Many of these cameras were sold to multiple law enforcement agencies. Multiple orders were also received in 2016 for the LE10 Camera System as well as the new LE50 Body Camera.








CONNECTIVITY

LE10 On the Body Law Enforcement Video Recorder has 100 meter Wi-Fi range for management by iPhone or Android devices. It has an 8 megapixel sensor and shoots video at a resolution of 1080 pixels. The LE10 allows the use of smartphones as a remote control of the camera, by a free downloadable application.
The LE50 HD Body Camera is a state of the art designed body camera strategically built around Ambarella chip sets (AMBA). Industry leading record time (10 hours @1080,12 hours @720) / 30 hours of standby time and 32GB of internal tamper proof storage.
 
 








SECURITY

Force Protection Video provides secure on-site storage or Cloud based servers. The LE10 or LE50 give police departments control of your video just like other evidence. 
Evidence is very important today and with our VeriPic Storage Locker and DEM (Digital Evidence Manager); there will never be a question about any evidence submitted for a case.
