Dennis Lloyd is founder and President of Columbia Capital Management. He began his career in the municipal finance industry in 1981. Since then he has executed a large variety of transactions, including single and multi-family housing bonds, refundings, restructurings, temporary notes, asset sales, variable rate demand bonds, grantor trusts, swaps and other derivative products. 
His accomplishments include serving as financial advisor on the highest rated unemployment bond issue nationwide, establishing the financing structure and bond covenants for the City of Topeka, Kansas, Water and Wastewater Utility System, implementing an updated indenture for the Kansas Turnpike Authority, restructuring the Parking Revenue Bond system for the City of St. Louis, Missouri, developing several novel revenue bond structures for Kansas Development Finance Authority transactions, educating issuers regarding the disadvantages of various "cutting edge" financing alternatives (including swaps and premium callable bonds), and working with the Missouri Housing Development Commission to implement the first tax credit advance loan program in the country. 
Mr. Lloyd's experience is unusual for the breadth and variety of the transactions he has executed. His background includes the development of innovative financing concepts, as well as the origination and execution of transactions. Mr. Lloyd has provided advice on complex transactions for a number of large issuers, including: the Birmingham Water Works Board; City of Chicago; Illinois Department of Employment Security; the Kansas Development Finance Authority; the Kansas Turnpike Authority; the Missouri Housing Development Commission; the State of Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri; Topeka, Kansas; and St. Louis, Missouri.

One of Columbia Capital’s core strengths is our approach to staffing our advisory services. Working as a team, Columbia Capital’s advisors and analysts coordinate effectively to ensure unparalleled responsiveness and seamless account coverage. This approach allows us to be flexible when it comes to meeting our clients' demands—whether that entails a prompt turnaround of an urgent analysis, or being available to present a topic to a client’s board/governing body on short notice.
Columbia is different. Columbia distinguishes itself by providing independent, thoughtful, and tailored financial advice. Our advice is big picture—whether a client is seeking quick pro forma analysis, conducting a simple refunding, restructuring its entire debt portfolio, or looking to amend its existing credit structure, Columbia works to provide analysis and advice that is relevant to the issuer’s unique financial position and operating environment. Through its thoughtful approach to providing financial advice to a broad range of governmental issuers across the nation, Columbia has gained a reputation for excellence of advice, thoroughness of approach, and creativity in problem solving.

He has spent his entire professional career in municipal finance as an investment banker for fifteen (15) years and operated MG McMahon & Co., an independent financial advisory firm, since 1989. In April 1999 MG McMahon & Co. merged with CSG Advisors Incorporated making Mr. McMahon a Senior Financial Advisor with the firm. Mr. McMahon left CSG Advisors to join Columbia Capital in order to better serve his clients. Mr. McMahon has served as financial advisor on over 100 transactions aggregating in excess of $2.5 billion in bonds.
Mr. McMahon has acted as senior manager on numerous financings throughout the country from which he has developed an in-depth knowledge of the underwriting, sale, trading and distribution of municipal securities to both the institutional as well as the retail segments of the municipal bond market.
From 1977 through 1988, Mr. McMahon was an investment banker for Lehman Brothers (and its predecessors), a national investment banking/brokerage firm as a Senior Vice President and Regional Manager. Prior to joining Lehman Brothers, from 1973-1977 Mr. McMahon was a Vice President responsible for underwriting and financial advisory activities for a Kansas City based investment banking firm which specialized in the underwriting, trading and sale of municipal bonds for Missouri local governmental units.
Mr. McMahon's prior experience as a senior vice president of a major national investment banking firm allows him to offer invaluable advice in the selection, structuring and implementation process of negotiated or competitive sale of municipal bonds with national, regional and local investment and commercial banking firms.
During Mr. McMahon's public finance career he has worked on housing financings with several state as well as local housing finance agencies and municipal issuers.
Mr. McMahon received his Bachelor of Science, Business Administration with a dual emphasis in accounting and finance from the University of Missouri graduating with honors in 1971.

return to staff team



















































Jeff White is a Principal of Columbia Capital Management. Prior to joining Columbia Capital in 2001, Mr. White spent more than a decade as a local government management practitioner. 	
As a city manager, assistant city manager, department head, and budget director in cities from 14,000 to 124,000 in population, Mr. White became very familiar with the financial needs of local governments as debt issuers and investors. As public works director responsible for transportation, building inspection, engineering, parking and water utilities (water, wastewater, and storm water), he managed annual operating budgets of nearly $55 million and capital programs exceeding $150 million. He enjoys bringing his passion for public service and an understanding of the business of local government to Columbia's clients. 
Mr. White has experience serving a wide variety of issuers. His clients include the City of Los Angeles, Chicago Public Schools; the Kansas Turnpike Authority; the Illinois Toll Highway Authority; St. Louis County, Missouri; Metro Bi-State Development Agency (St. Louis); East-West University (Chicago); Roosevelt University (Chicago); and numerousregional and  local issuers. 
Mr. White served as lead advisor on the City Colleges of Chicago's (CCC) inaugural general obligation bond issuance in 2013. Because CCC was pursuing the issuance of alternate bonds pursuant to the Illinois Local Government Debt Reform Act, the CCC needed to identify specific sources of revenue to pledge to the bonds that would serve as the first repayment source in front of an unlimited pledge of property taxes that would only be tapped should the alternate revenues prove to be insufficient. Mr. White presented to the CCC various alternate revenue sources available including the benefits and drawbacks of each potential source, or combination of sources, and the level of bonding each could support. Key factors in the decision process included the CCC's desire to differentiate their offering from other local bond issuers and the negative optics that certain pledged revenues might bring. With Mr. White's analysis and recommendations in hand, CCC had the resources needed to make the decision best suited to their situation and future bond issuance goals and plans. His work for Chicago non-profits includes advising on the financing of academic facilities for both Roosevelt University and East-West University.
Mr. White is currently advising the City of Edgerton, Kansas, on the financing of significant public infrastructure supporting BNSF railroad's newest intermodal transportation facility, the only one of its kind west of the Mississippi, and the development of a related logistics park that will eventually contain more than 18 million square feet of warehouse and distribution space. The underpinning of this financing is a three party agreement between the City, BNSF and a master developer of the surrounding logistics park. Because of the City's small size, the parties are currently pursuing a public/private partnership model to finance infrastructure costs that would be beyond the City's ability to support on its own.
Mr. White holds an A.B. in Political Science from the University of Michigan and a Master of Public Administration in Local Government Management from the University of Kansas. He is a Series 50 municipal advisor representative and a Series 65 Investment Adviser Representative.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Performance
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a CDSC.
Class V: POP returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at NAV. Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.

Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).

Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges or redemption fees, but do not include 12b-1 fees and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Rankings for each share class will vary due to different expenses. Had sales charges or redemption fees been included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.
© 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund's most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund's NAV.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.


Performance
Returns shown do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, or imposed on Accounts that may own shares directly. Inclusion of these charges would reduce total returns for all periods shown.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year. 
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund’s share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.
The Columbia Variable Portfolios and Wanger Funds (the "Variable Funds") are available only through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by participating insurance companies or certain eligible retirement plans. The Variable Funds are not offered to the public. Not all Variable Funds and classes are available in all contracts, policies or plans. Please contact your financial advisor or insurance representative for more information.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Columbia Variable Portfolios. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Wanger Funds. The variable funds are distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., member FINRA.


Performance
Effective 09/01/2016, performance reporting for Class A and Class AG with all sales charges reflects a maximum sales charge of 3.75% , except for the Columbia Conservative 529 Portfolio, FA Strategic Income 529 Portfolio, Columbia Income Opportunities 529 Portfolio, Columbia Total Return Bond 529 Portfolio, JP Morgan Core Bond 529 Portfolio, iShares TIPS Bond ETF 529 Portfolio, Templeton Global Bond 529 Portfolio and Columbia US Government Mortgage 529 Portfolio, which reflect a maximum sales charge of 3%. The Columbia College 529 Portfolio, Columbia Short Term Bond 529 Portfolio, Columbia Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio have no initial sales charges for Pricing Alternative A, but the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio has a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for Pricing Alternative C.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor or visit columbiathreadneedle.com/us for a Program Description, which contains this and other important information about the Future Scholar College Savings Plan. Read it carefully before investing. You should also consider, before investing, whether the investor’s or designated beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state’s qualified tuition program.
Expense ratios are as of the plan's most recent Program Brochure & Tuition Savings Agreement. Performance may reflect waivers or reimbursements of fund expenses by the adviser or its affiliates. Absent these waivers, or reimbursement arrangements, performance results may be lower. The net and gross expense ratios shown are updated on the first day of each month.
Total returns assume the reinvestment of all underlying fund distributions at NAV. Portfolio unit value (PUV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSCs). If they were included, returns would have been lower.
Pricing Alternative B: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the applicable CDSC for the holding period after an initial purchase as follows: through the first year, 5%; second year, 4%; third year, 3%; fourth year, 3%; fifth year, 2%; sixth year, 1% and thereafter, 0%. These shares convert to Pricing Alternative A units in the eighth year after purchase. Effective December 1, 2010, Class B of each portfolio was closed to both new accounts and additional contributions to existing accounts.
Pricing Alternative C: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of a 1% CDSC for the first year after purchase except for the Conservative 529 and College 529 Portfolios as well as the single-fund fixed-income portfolios and the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio, which have a 0.75% CDSC.
Pricing Alternative E: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Pricing Alternative Z: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Contributions initially invested directly into the Columbia Bank Deposit 529 Portfolio are not subject to the imposition of an initial or deferred sales charge under any Pricing Alternative.

understanding muni advisor regulation

What is a "municipal advisor"? What is "advice"? Securities regulations impact the way bond issuers interact with advisors and underwriters and cover nearly ever party involved with an issue.
Learn more about the regulations in effect as of July 1, 2014, here.




exceptions &EXCLUSIONS

The SEC constructed the municipal advisor rule to cover nearly anyone providing advice to municipal entities on muni bonds and financial products, but some persons and firms are not covered.  
Learn more about the exceptions to the municipal advisor rule here.




THE CASE FOR INDEPENDENT ADVICE

The municipal bond market becomes more complex and challenging each day. As a result, an issuer's or borrower's investment in an independent municipal advisor is money well spent.
Why engage an indepedent municipal advisor? Consider these reasons.
