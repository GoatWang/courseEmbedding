            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Its businesses include regulated electric and natural gas utility operations and other energy-related businesses.

South Carolina Electric & Gas Company[edit]
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's leading subsidiary, traces its history to 1846, when a group of Charleston business leaders formed the Charleston Gas Light Company. However, its corporate structure dates to 1924, with the formation of Broad River Power Company. A year later, Broad River bought the electric and gas properties of Columbia Railway, Gas and Electric Company.[2]
In 1927, the Lexington Water Power Company received a license to build a dam on the Saluda River northwest of Columbia. Saluda Dam, which would create the 50,000-acre (202 km2) Lake Murray, was the largest man-made barrier built for power production in the world when completed in 1930. In addition, the project provided jobs during the Great Depression.[2]
In 1937, the Broad River Power Company changed its name to South Carolina Electric & Gas Company. Five years later, Lexington Water Power Company merged with SCE&G. This was followed in 1948 with the acquisition of South Carolina Power Company', successor to Charleston Gas Light, from the Southern Company. In 1984, SCE&G formed SCANA as a holding company.
Today, SCE&G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 661,000 retail and wholesale customers in a service area covering more than 17,000 square miles (44,000 km2) in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The company is also engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas, primarily at retail, to approximately 314,000 customers in a service area covering more than 22,000 square miles (57,000 km2)--most of the state outside of the Upstate and the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte area.
SCE&G currently operates 4 hydroelectric plants, 1 pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, 4 coal-fired plants, 1 nuclear plant, 1 combined cycle power plant, 1 "re-powered" formerly coal-fired plant with a natural gas-powered steam unit and two combined cycle units, and 16 simple cycle combustion turbines. The total output is over 5,800 MW.[3]
Carolina Gas Transmission[edit]
Formed in November 2006, CGTC is an interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and Georgia regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Its predecessors were the South Carolina Pipeline Company and SCG Pipeline Company. CGTC receives gas from Southern Natural Gas Company, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation and the Southern LNG terminal at Elba Island, Georgia.
In February 2015, Carolina Gas Transmission was sold to Dominion Resources, and is no longer a part of the SCANA family of subsidiaries
PSNC Energy[edit]
PSNC Energy (Public Service North Carolina Energy) is a regulated public utility engaged primarily in purchasing, transporting, distributing and selling natural gas to approximately 535,000 customers in the north central, Piedmont and western areas of North Carolina. The service area encompasses 28 counties and covers approximately 12,000 square miles (31,000 km2) in North Carolina. Its headquarters is in Gastonia, North Carolina.
SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc (SEMI)[edit]
SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc. markets natural gas to over 500 industrial and commercial customers, municipalities, power producers and aggregators, primarily in the Southeast.
SCANA Energy[edit]
SCANA Energy (a division of SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc.), based in Atlanta, is the second largest marketer of natural gas in Georgia, serving more than 460,000 customers. SCANA Energy, along with Gas South, Infinite Energy, and Georgia Natural Gas are amongst the major gas providers in Georgia.[4] SCANA Energy also has a regulated unit, SCANA Energy Regulated Division, selected by the Georgia Public Service Commission to serve as the state’s only regulated natural gas provider.
SCANA Communications[edit]
SCANA Communications claims to offer a wide range of "leading edge communications solutions"[clarification needed] in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. The company operates fiber optic LONG-HAUL and ACCESS networks throughout South Carolina and in parts of North Carolina and Georgia, and leverages the fiber[clarification needed] of its partners, Palmetto Net and FRC, which are regional Interexchange carriers.
SCANA Communications also offers clients with Point-of-Presence (POP) equipment co-location at designated sites along the fiber route and has a state-of-the-art data center in downtown Columbia, South Carolina.[citation needed] In addition, the company offers a full suite of communication tower services designed to meet the needs of both fixed and mobile wireless providers. Services include site acquisition, zoning support, build-to-suite, site management of existing towers, shared tenant co-location, and fiber backbone access.
Customers include telecom carriers and large retail businesses, including all of the major long distance and cellular carriers.[citation needed]
In February 2015, SCANA Communications was sold to Spirit Communications, and is no longer a part of the SCANA family of companies.

South Carolina Electric & Gas Company[edit]
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's leading subsidiary, traces its history to 1846, when a group of Charleston business leaders formed the Charleston Gas Light Company. However, its corporate structure dates to 1924, with the formation of Broad River Power Company. A year later, Broad River bought the electric and gas properties of Columbia Railway, Gas and Electric Company.[2]
In 1927, the Lexington Water Power Company received a license to build a dam on the Saluda River northwest of Columbia. Saluda Dam, which would create the 50,000-acre (202 km2) Lake Murray, was the largest man-made barrier built for power production in the world when completed in 1930. In addition, the project provided jobs during the Great Depression.[2]
In 1937, the Broad River Power Company changed its name to South Carolina Electric & Gas Company. Five years later, Lexington Water Power Company merged with SCE&G. This was followed in 1948 with the acquisition of South Carolina Power Company', successor to Charleston Gas Light, from the Southern Company. In 1984, SCE&G formed SCANA as a holding company.
Today, SCE&G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 661,000 retail and wholesale customers in a service area covering more than 17,000 square miles (44,000 km2) in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The company is also engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas, primarily at retail, to approximately 314,000 customers in a service area covering more than 22,000 square miles (57,000 km2)--most of the state outside of the Upstate and the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte area.
SCE&G currently operates 4 hydroelectric plants, 1 pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, 4 coal-fired plants, 1 nuclear plant, 1 combined cycle power plant, 1 "re-powered" formerly coal-fired plant with a natural gas-powered steam unit and two combined cycle units, and 16 simple cycle combustion turbines. The total output is over 5,800 MW.[3]
Carolina Gas Transmission[edit]
Formed in November 2006, CGTC is an interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and Georgia regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Its predecessors were the South Carolina Pipeline Company and SCG Pipeline Company. CGTC receives gas from Southern Natural Gas Company, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation and the Southern LNG terminal at Elba Island, Georgia.
In February 2015, Carolina Gas Transmission was sold to Dominion Resources, and is no longer a part of the SCANA family of subsidiaries
PSNC Energy[edit]
PSNC Energy (Public Service North Carolina Energy) is a regulated public utility engaged primarily in purchasing, transporting, distributing and selling natural gas to approximately 535,000 customers in the north central, Piedmont and western areas of North Carolina. The service area encompasses 28 counties and covers approximately 12,000 square miles (31,000 km2) in North Carolina. Its headquarters is in Gastonia, North Carolina.

SCANA Energy, along with Gas South, Infinite Energy, and Georgia Natural Gas are amongst the major gas providers in Georgia.[4] SCANA Energy also has a regulated unit, SCANA Energy Regulated Division, selected by the Georgia Public Service Commission to serve as the state’s only regulated natural gas provider.
SCANA Communications[edit]
SCANA Communications claims to offer a wide range of "leading edge communications solutions"[clarification needed] in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. The company operates fiber optic LONG-HAUL and ACCESS networks throughout South Carolina and in parts of North Carolina and Georgia, and leverages the fiber[clarification needed] of its partners, Palmetto Net and FRC, which are regional Interexchange carriers.
SCANA Communications also offers clients with Point-of-Presence (POP) equipment co-location at designated sites along the fiber route and has a state-of-the-art data center in downtown Columbia, South Carolina.[citation needed] In addition, the company offers a full suite of communication tower services designed to meet the needs of both fixed and mobile wireless providers.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.
