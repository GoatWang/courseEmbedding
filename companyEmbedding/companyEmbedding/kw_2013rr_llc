		Used and New Diesel Generators  
                 


				WPP offers a wide selection of quality diesel generators in sizes ranging from 20kW – 2500kW. Whether you seek portable or stationary diesel generators―for prime, continuous or standby usage―we can ensure you find what you are looking for.
The simplest explanation of a generator’s function: it provides electrical power. A diesel generator is the combination of a diesel engine with an alternator (also called a generator end) to generate electrical energy.   This alternator houses electrical conductors which react to the engine’s mechanical energy and convert it into useful electrical power.
We have many informative articles describing how generators work and which to choose for a particular application.

2017 BMW S1000RR www.Totalmotorcycle.com  Key Features
 
The new sporty BMW Motorrad 4-cylinder models.
 
Supreme riding dynamics, athletic character combined with maximum safety  and everyday practicality – these are the defining characteristics of  the BMW Motorrad 4-cylinder models. For the model year 2017 the supersports  bike S 1000 RR, the dynamic roadster S 1000 R and the adventure sports model  S 1000 XR have undergone the following model revisions:
 
The new BMW S 1000 RR – virtually perfect yet still optimised. • Adaptation to EU4 requirements. • ABS Pro as a new element of the optional equipment item “Riding  Modes Pro”. • DTC as standard. • The new RR now as standard as a single-seat model with passenger seat  cover. The optional passenger package is available free of charge as an alternative. • Well-established colour concepts Racing Red non-metallic/Lightwhite  non-metallic and BMW Motorsport (Lupine Blue metallic/Lightwhite non-metallic/Racing  Red non-metallic), though in a new design. • New colour variant Granite Grey metallic/Blackstorm metallic. • Design Option Wheels with red rim lines now included as standard as  part of the colour concepts Racing Red non-metallic/Lightwhite non-metallic  and BMW Motorsport. 
 

 





 
 
  
 
2017 BMW S1000RR www.Totalmotorcycle.com  Features and Benefits 
 
The new BMW S 1000 RR – the virtually perfect supersport model has been  further optimized. Ever since BMW Motorrad launched the S 1000 RR in 2009,  the first 4-cylinder supersport bike made by BMW, the “Double R”  has had a lasting impact on this market segment. Consistent and ongoing development  has since ensured that the RR occupies pole position among the superbikes  with road traffic certification. For the model year 2017 it was, once again,  possible to further enhance the virtually perfect supersport bike.
 
Potent in-line 4-cylinder engine, adapted to EU4 requirements. The 999 cc  in-line 4-cylinder engine has been adapted to meet the requirements of the  EU4 pollutant class. The peak output is still 146 kW (199 hp) at 13,500 rpm  and the maximum torque of 83 lb-ft (113 Nm) is reached at 10,500 rpm. In the  interests of excellent rideability, the new RR also has a wide engine speed  range along with torque from approximately 9,500 (83 lb-ft/112 Nm) to 12,  000 rpm (83 lb-ft/113 Nm).
 
Riding modes “Rain”, “Sport” and “Race” along  with Race ABS and Dynamic Traction Control as standard. The new RR features  the three riding modes “Rain”, “Sport” and “Race”  as standard as well as the partial integral Race ABS. New additions to the  standard trim include Dynamic Traction control DTC with banking sensor and  fine adjustment at +/- seven levels for the best possible performance and  safety when accelerating. 
 
Optional equipment item “Ride Modes Pro” with additional riding  modes “Slick” and “User”, Launch Control, Pit Lane Limiter  and now also ABS Pro. With the optional equipment item “Ride Modes Pro”,  the new RR offers the two additional riding modes “Slick” and “User”  as before, as well a Launch Control for active support on racing starts, among  other things. A configurable Pit Lane Limiter also enables adherence to the  prescribed speed in the pit lane.
 
ABS Pro is a new component of the optional equipment item “Ride Modes  Pro”. While the existing BMW Motorrad ABS systems already provide a very  high degree of safety when braking in a straight line, ABS Pro now takes this  a step further to offer increased safety when braking on bends. Here, ABS  Pro (available in the modes “Rain”, “Sport” and “Race”)  is able to prevent the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied  quickly; this reduces abrupt changes in steering force on shock-braking maneuvers  and stops the motorcycle from rearing up unintentionally.
 
The new RR now as a single-seater with passenger seat cover and attractive  new colors. From now on, the new S 1000 RR is configured as standard as a  single-seater with passenger seat cover. However, the RR may be ordered with  a passenger package free of charge: this includes both passenger seat and  passenger footrests.
 
The RR continues to be available in the color schemes Racing Red non-metallic/Light  White non-metallic for the dynamic look and BMW Motorsport (Lupine Blue metallic/Light  White non-metallic/Racing Red non-metallic in reference to the bike’s  motor racing genes), although in a new configuration. The two color concepts  are supplemented as standard with red rim lines.
 
In addition, there is the new color scheme Granite Grey metallic/Black Storm  metallic, which gives the RR a refined appearance.
 
Optional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories. As usual, an extensive  array of optional equipment and motorcycle accessories are available for those  who wish to customize their new BMW S 1000 RR.

TST 2 Pin LED Flasher Relay Gen 2















 


          After many disappointing relays from other sources for other bikes, this was a PLEASANT surprise. It really is a plug and play, a straight drop-in for the OE part. It worked right out of the bag and fit in the exact same location. A beautiful thing!

TST 2 Pin LED Flasher Relay Gen 2















 


          After many disappointing relays from other sources for other bikes, this was a PLEASANT surprise. It really is a plug and play, a straight drop-in for the OE part. It worked right out of the bag and fit in the exact same location. A beautiful thing!

Rolls-Royce to deliver gas gensets for IMG midstream power plants in Pennsylvania

Wednesday, 27 January 2016

Long-term supply agreement and long-term service agreement signed 
First delivery: six medium speed Bergen gas gensets to supply 40 MW of electric power 
IMG will feed the generated electricity into the local grid

Wexford, PA, USA / BERGEN, NORWAY – At the end of 2015, the power generation provider IMG Development LLC and Rolls-Royce signed a long-term strategic agreement for the supply of Rolls-Royce medium-speed gensets for a minimum of five plants extending into 2020. The first part of the agreement involves the delivery of six B35:40 gas generating sets designed for two new power plants in Pennsylvania, USA, that will be operated by affiliates of IMG Midstream LLC. The two companies also signed a long-term service agreement for the systems being supplied to the two plants. The power plants will feed up to 40 MW of electric power into the local grid. Bergen Engines is part of Rolls-Royce Power Systems. 
Three gensets, each of which will produce 7,010 kW of electric power, are to be installed in each power plant. The gensets are based on the medium-speed 16-cylinder B35:40 gas engine from Bergen Engines. 
Ron J. Kiecana, Senior Managing Director and Board Member at IMG said: “Rolls Royce has the right end-to-end power generation solution to help us rapidly deploy our distributed generation model in infrastructure constrained areas with the type of flexible power needed to address a dynamic energy market where traditional energy supply and consumption patterns are changing. We are excited about this partnership and growing our distributed power generation model with Rolls Royce in the U.S. market.”
Matthias Vogel, Head of Power Generation Business at Rolls-Royce Power Systems, added: “We are delighted with the new long-term cooperation with IMG Development LLC and the trust IMG has placed in our products.”

TST 2 Pin LED Flasher Relay Gen 2















 


          After many disappointing relays from other sources for other bikes, this was a PLEASANT surprise. It really is a plug and play, a straight drop-in for the OE part. It worked right out of the bag and fit in the exact same location. A beautiful thing!
