Oraxol
Oraxol (Oral Paclitaxel) is an oral formulation of Paclitaxel developed by Athenex that is administered with a second drug (HM30181A) to promote absorption of paclitaxel in the gastrointestinal tract.  The World Health Organization has designated Paclitaxel as a critical anti-cancer drug,.  We believe an oral form of paclitaxel will be a major advance in the treatment of cancer, and are rapidly advancing our lead Orascovery drug candidate, Oraxol. In 2015, we started enrolling patients in a Phase 3 Oraxol study in a head to head comparison with the standard IV formulation of paclitaxel.  The first interim analysis from this Phase 3 study in metastatic breast cancer is expected in 2017.  In October 2016, we entered into a clinical study collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company to evaluate Oraxol in combination with Lilly’s approved monoclonal antibody Cyramza (ramucirumab) to treat gastric, gastric- esophageal and esophageal cancer.  The ability to dose paclitaxel orally is expected to   provide flexibility in the design and optimization of combination regimens, resulting in further advances in the treatment of cancer.

Athenex
Improving the lives of cancer patients everywhere










Operating Platforms
















We have crafted our business model in order to capture the market opportunities in two of the largest pharmaceutical markets in the world. The U.S. represents the largest pharmaceutical market in the world. China has identified biotechnology as one of its strategic industries of focus. In addition, there are several unique aspects to the two markets whereby most biopharmaceutical companies are not well positioned to capture both U.S. and China markets. We have research and product development teams in both countries allowing us to leverage our innovation platform resources, including development and regulatory expertise, to maximize opportunities in both countries. We intend to serve as a technology bridge between these unique markets. We also expect to identify new technology opportunities through acquisitions, licensing or partnering in either market and position ourselves as a gateway to the other market.
We have a business model positioned to capture value by creating opportunities through multiple levers for growth. We are internalizing our commercial infrastructure and supply chain through a variety of organic methods, acquisitions, and partnerships which we believe will enable us to capture greater shareholder value as well as minimize supply chain risk for our proprietary oncology product pipeline. We have built a commercial sales and marketing infrastructure in the U.S. and intend to continue to further build out this segment. We expect this segment to start selling existing in-licensed therapeutically related oncology products in 2017 as a means of funding our commercial infrastructure. Through acquisitions, we own elements of a high potency oncology supply chain, which we believe are important to control in order to minimize risk of disruption. By utilizing capital efficient public-private partnerships in the U.S. and China, we expect to have built cGMP manufacturing facilities in both geographies. We expect to continue to further build out this model using a variety of different methods, including organic growth, strategic acquisitions and collaborations.





Commercial Segment



We have begun building our U.S. commercial operation in preparation for future FDA approvals of our proprietary product candidates. We believe that our experienced product commercialization team can build an infrastructure that leverages both our global facilities and collaborative relationships to achieve global distribution of any FDA approved products in a timely and cost-effective manner.
Learn More >>



Internal Supply Chain



We believe internalization of our supply chain is uniquely suited to execute in both the U.S. and China, two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical markets. We intend to utilize cGMP manufacturing facilities from our public/private partnerships in both the China and U.S. markets as a mechanism to access both important markets and minimize supply disruptions. We intend to manufacture certain of our proprietary drugs and our partnered drugs commercialized around the world. Additionally, we expect that the expansion of our existing cGMP high potency API facilities will provide us with more flexibility, and control over high potency APIs as our drugs start to become commercialized. Our goal is to continue expanding this infrastructure and to leverage it to maintain future financial flexibility by optimizing our financial commitments and capital expenditures, which we believe will create value for shareholders.

About Athenex













We are a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer. Our mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by creating more effective, safer and tolerable treatments. We have generated our clinical product candidates through our Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition research platforms, which are based on our understanding of human absorption biology and novel approaches to inhibiting kinase activity, respectively. We believe that our ability to overcome the challenges of oral delivery of chemotherapy and convert cornerstone therapies to the oral route offers significant potential benefits to patient outcomes by allowing patients to stay on therapy longer and extending the potential opportunities to combine with other agents, including targeted and immunotherapies that would otherwise be too toxic in combination with IV chemotherapy. We have assembled a leadership team and have established global operations in the U.S. and China across the pharmaceutical value chain to execute our mission to become a global leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and improve health outcomes.
Cancer is a major health problem worldwide. The global market for cancer treatments reached $107 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach $150 billion in 2020. Common treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and such newer methods as targeted therapy; however, chemotherapy remains one of the key treatment options for cancer patients and is traditionally administrated intravenously (IV). The limitations of IV chemotherapy involve repeated painful IV line insertions, potential anaphylactic reactions, expensive hospital visits, toxic side effects and poor quality of life for cancer patients. To address this unmet medical need, development of oral chemotherapy that is more effective and more tolerable, can be administered at home, and negates the need for weekly IV infusions and hospital visits is urgently needed.
Based in Buffalo, New York, we were formed in 2003 and have been funded from inception by approximately $200 million in private financings and public-private partnerships with an estimated aggregate value of $375 million.  In advance of the launch of our proprietary product candidates in the U.S., our commercial team intends to market oncology and oncology symptom-related products, We have organized our business model into three segments: Oncology Innovation Platform, Commercial Platform and Global Supply Chain Platform—with operations in both the U.S. and China. Our global operations across the three segments are shown above.
Our Global Supply Chain Platform manufactures API for use internally in our research and development and clinical studies, and for sale to pharmaceutical customers globally. Our Commercial Platform currently markets the APIs produced by our Global Supply Chain Platform, 10 products in the specialty and generic market segment in the U.S. and products under Section 503B of the FDCA through our compound pharmacy facility.
Our leadership team was carefully assembled to capture the global commercial market opportunities in novel drug development. Our executive officers are seasoned leaders with complementary skill sets across global pharmaceutical research and development, operations, supply chain and manufacturing, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. We believe this characteristic is unique for a U.S.-based company and we believe we will be able to utilize this strength to create long term value for cancer patients, our employees and our shareholders. Our team is excited about the prospects of creating new paradigms in the treatment of cancer in developed markets and also driving our product candidates to emerging markets where patient access to treatments has historically been limited.

Athenex is organized around three platforms including an Oncology Innovation Platform, a Commercial Platform and a Global Supply Chain Platform. Athenex’s Oncology Innovation Platform generates clinical candidates through an extensive understanding of kinases, including novel binding sites, human absorption biology and through the application of Athenex’s proprietary research and selection processes in the lab. The Company’s current clinical pipeline is derived from two different platform technologies Athenex calls Orascovery and Src Kinase Inhibition. The Orascovery platform is based on the novel oral P-glycoprotein pump inhibitor molecule HM30181A, through which Athenex is able to facilitate oral absorption of traditional cytotoxics, which Athenex believes may offer improved patient tolerability and efficacy as compared to IV administration of the same cytotoxics. The Src Kinase Inhibition platform refers to novel small molecule compounds that have multiple mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of the activity of Src Kinase and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization during cell division. Athenex believes the combination of these mechanisms of action provides a broader range of anti-cancer activity as compared to either mechanism of action alone. Athenex’s employees worldwide are dedicated to improving the lives of cancer patients by creating more active and tolerable treatments. Athenex has offices in Buffalo and Clarence, New York, Cranford, New Jersey, Houston, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, Hong Kong, Taipei Taiwan, and multiple locations in Chongqing, China. About NasdaqNasdaq (NDAQ) is a leading global provider of trading, clearing, exchange technology, listing, information and public company services.

BUFFALO, N.Y. and HONG KONG, Sept. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Athenex Pharmaceutical Division and Gland Pharma, one of the major injectable pharmaceutical companies in India, announced today a partnership agreement to launch and market injectable products in the United States.  Many of these products are therapeutically relevant to the Athenex proprietary pipeline of products under development.  In addition, the partnered products are either already approved by the US FDA or expected to be approved in the near term.  The initial partnership is for more than 20 products.  Under the partnership, Gland has developed and will supply injectable products that Athenex will market in the United States.








The Athenex Specialty Products Division was created in 2016 to be the commercial infrastructure that will market and distribute Athenex's products globally, including its proprietary pipeline of products.  This highly skilled team, which has significant experience in marketing specialty products, will begin that marketing program in the near future and will eventually market Athenex's unique proprietary oral oncology products.  Athenex will continue to build relationships with GPOs, wholesalers, distributors, physician groups, and alternate site customers, and will forge the path to future commercialization of these highly unique products.  
Mr. Jeffrey Yordon, President of Athenex Specialty Products, stated "We are very excited to have this opportunity to partner with Gland Pharma, one of the leading specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world.  Gland's supply capabilities, and excellent track record of execution and high quality, make them an outstanding partner for Athenex.  The Gland partnership is one of many partnerships we plan on executing in the near term and will supply high value products to our markets.  We are extremely pleased to be working with an organization of Gland's caliber.  The emphasis on product selection with Gland and other future partners is oncology and oncology supportive care which will complement our robust proprietary pipeline of oral oncolytics.  Opportunities like this enable Athenex to build a strong infrastructure creating our own sales, marketing and distribution systems prior to the launch of our first proprietary oncology product."
Srinivas Sadu, Chief Operating Officer of Gland Pharma, stated "Gland is proud to be a significant partner to Athenex.  We have the complete confidence in the management team that Mr. Yordon has assembled and we fully expect them to be highly successful in the market as they have always demonstrated in the past.  We look forward to Athenex's success and expect our relationship will grow in the future."  
The specialty products being launched in the near term will create a solid revenue and margin base to help subsidize the ongoing clinical trials and research and development projects for the Athenex proprietary pipeline.  Many of the near term products in this launch will be in the oncology market, which is synergistic with Athenex's proprietary oral oncology pipeline.  To further the synergies, the company will be working closely with its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) division, PolyMed, to back-integrate API into the Athenex pipeline of products.  The company fully expects to consummate several more of these types of transactions in the near future.   
About Athenex, Inc.
Founded in 2003, Athenex is a global innovative pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of next generation therapies for cancer diseases and supportive therapies with a particular emphasis on the China and U.S. markets.  The company is dedicated to delivering innovative drugs that can have a life-changing impact on cancer patients.  The Athenex business includes: three portfolios of innovative proprietary products under development, medical technology research innovation centers, product development and regulatory teams, and existing manufacturing facilities in China and the U.S.  Athenex employees include several hundred professionals dedicated to the mission of improving the lives of cancer patients throughout the world.  With a connected innovation, development and manufacturing presence concentrated in China and the U.S., Athenex can identify, develop, and deliver unique medical technology across continents and multiple regulatory environments.  Athenex has offices in Buffalo and Clarence New York, Cranford New Jersey, Hong Kong, Taipei Taiwan, and multiple locations in Chongqing, China.  In addition to their offices, Athenex has regional development partners in Dunedin New Zealand, Hong Kong, Guangzhou China, Seoul South Korea, Taipei Taiwan, Guatemala City, Guatemala, and Buenos Aires Argentina.
