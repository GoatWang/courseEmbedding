Fact Sheet - HearGlass









































 

















        

















  















  



  





HEARGLASS changes life for the hearing impaired:
Problem: world is growing deafer while hearing aids (“HA”s) underperform

36MM Americans suffer from disabling hearing loss
33% over 65 and 67% over 75 suffer from hearing loss

Today’s HAs: sound distorted, ambient noise poorly filtered, tuning requires audiologist and batteries an expensive nuisance
HEARGLASS: disruptive wearable device that incorporates full audio spectrum HiFi HAs into eyeglasses, allowing for a directional hearing experience superior to traditional HAs. Bluetooth/WiFi capabilities allow for hands-free music streaming, telephony, voice-activated commands and on-the-fly setting changes






  





Key complaints with today’s HAs

Distortion from truncated audio spectrum
Hard to hear amid ambient noise
Limited/no user tunability
Expensive and nonrechargeable batteries
Missed audio lost forever
High ~$4K avg cost + batteries and loss











HEARGLASS Solution

Preserves full HiFi audio spectrum
Directional mic
Easy user tuning, also remote-tunable
Rechargeable battery packs
Patented “What?” button replay
Direct, retail, and subscription service/sales models







  





Target Markets:

Begin with dissatisfied HA owners, early adopters, and music lovers
NIH estimates 28.8MM US adults could benefit from using HAs
Worldwide HA sales in 2015 exceeded $20Bn, with 500MM people hearing impaired

Sales/Marketing Strategy:

PR, digital marketing channels and influencer endorsement
Multichannel distribution/service opportunities
OEM technology licensing for 3rd party product incorporation
Partnering opportunities with eyeglass/HA and healthcare industries, AR/VR OEMs

Primary Competitors Ripe for Disruption: 6 high-end HA makers with relatively stagnant technology and costly distribution.

Speaker, mics and batteries sacrifice performance when miniaturized in today’s “smaller-is-better” HA trend
Glasses have ample space for powerful hardware and batteries,; better sensors, Bluetooth/WiFi, telephony, other capabilities
HEARGLASS offers superior audio range/quality, telephony, Bluetooth/WiFi connectivity, and new market opportunities
