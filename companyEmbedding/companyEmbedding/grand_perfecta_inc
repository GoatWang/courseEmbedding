NEW YORK, Nov. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Grand Perfecta, Inc. (OTC Markets: GPIW), an established provider of data and analytics of horse racing information in Japan, will be a featured guest in an exclusive interview on Stock Traders Talk today, November 4th, 2014, at 9:00AM EST.  A direct link to the interview can be accessed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD53ZTeZcpM&feature=youtu.be or an archived recorded version can be found at http://stocktraderstalk.com immediately following the interview.
This interview will focus on Grand Perfecta's operations and the opportunities available to the company.
About Stock Traders Talk:
Stock Traders Talk specializes in radio interviews, and believes that when a corporate officer has the ability to demonstrate their passion, and personally cover talking points for their company it serves as the ultimate delivery platform.  Press Releases have value, however, they lack the effectiveness of a webcast in helping management connect with both current and potential shareholders on a personal level.  Stock Traders Talk Radio is an uncensored, comprehensive approach to disseminating vital facts about public companies trading on the OTC Markets. 
About Grand Perfecta, Inc. (GPIW)
Grand Perfecta, Inc. is a provider of data analytics, research publications and the distribution of horse racing and other related information in Japan.  Grand Perfecta's management is a team of professionals in the horse racing services industry with over 70 employees.  The Company has used its expertise to achieve considerable success with more than one million subscribers in Japan,  distributing its product via various media, including print, internet and text messaging and telephonically.  The Company also publishes Umajin, a horse racing magazine in its 15th year of production. Additionally, Grand Perfecta has produced several books on horse racing and has overseen the production and management of TV programs and events in horse racing and other sports industries.  Grand Perfecta is a Nevada corporation with offices in Las Vegas, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.  Grand Perfecta, Inc. maintains a website at www.g-perfecta.com while financial information can be viewed at www.otcmarkets.com.
