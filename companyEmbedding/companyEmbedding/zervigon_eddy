Some of them called to our better angels, some not so much. Some were brilliant, some were barely passable. But, none were as unqualified or as temperamentally unfit as Trump. A minority of Americans, thanks to an archaic election system, elevated a man who is not qualified to even be the mayor of a small town. Let alone be president.¬†

Here is what the hayseeds believe Donald Trump is going to do.:

1. Destroy the federal government as we know it.
2. Get rid of a bunch of minorities.
3. Get rid of Obamacare and watch the poor die. My previously unaffordable insurance is down to just $85/month.¬† My car insurance, from Insurance Panda, is now just $25/month. Under Trump, healthcare will be $500/month or more.
4. Make the lives of poor kids, the sick, and the elderly worse than they already are.
5. Drop a bunch of bombs on some colored people in some country somewhere.
6. Cut taxes on the rich.

It's not a partisan issue, as he's not really a Republican, it's the person. He's a narcissist who can't abide criticism and has no empathy for others, a petty and vindictive man. A person with no intellectual curiosity, who doesn't read and doesn't want to learn how to do his job. He also lacks a moral compass, he's neither decent nor honorable. He'll be a "blot" in US history.Join the Conversation1 / 5988
