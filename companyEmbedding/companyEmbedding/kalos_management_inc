A New and Intelligent Approach to Investing
Today’s high net-worth investors possess a much greater financial literacy than previous generations. With this level of sophistication, investors seek products and strategies that can potentially offer greater degrees of flexibility, intelligent diversification, tax efficiency and more control over their invested assets – and that’s what investors find when working with Kalos advisors. Our firm was founded on the principles reflected in the meaning of our name – that which is intrinsically fair, right and honorable. Our commitment to serve your advisor with integrity and provide products and strategies to meet the needs of our advisors’ clients, is our focus each and every day.

			 

Advocates for Your Best Interests
Kalos Management and its advisors have a fiduciary responsibility to act in your best interest – period.  We are committed to providing a diverse array of solutions and program offerings in order to effectively meet the unique needs of each client.
 

Expertise
Since its inception, Kalos has focused on providing sophisticated solutions using practices and investment programs more commonly utilized by institutions and endowments. Financial professionals using more advanced portfolio strategies can help their clients more effectively control risk while also positioning for growth; resulting in opportunities for greater income potential throughout retirement.
 

Comprehensive Offerings
At Kalos, we recognize that every investor's needs are unique and can benefit from access to diverse services and investment program offerings. Our advisors have expertise and experience in planning and implementing various brokerage, advisory and insurance offerings that can provide effective solutions for your financial goals.
 

Benefit from Independence
Because we are independent, we have the flexibility to offer a wide array of investment offerings so your advisor can recommend options that address your needs. As a result of our independence, we do not have quotas for our advisors to meet or limit them to recommending only proprietary products – they are free to choose investment programs and make recommendations that are in your best interest.

About Us

 











 


The Name, "Kalos":

Much thought and consideration went into choosing a name for the company. Like naming a child, naming a company is very personal and important. For us, the name had to reflect our purpose and serve as a daily reminder of our enduring values and focus. After much deliberation, we chose the name "Kalos."

			 

By definition, Kalos denotes that which is intrinsically "Fair, Right, Honorable, and of Such Conduct as Deserves Esteem." Kalos also means "Honest, Regarded with Honor, Honorable and Bringing Honor" and "to Maintain Good Works."

			 

The name describes our values and purpose. At Kalos, we always strive to treat and represent our clients, employees and associates in a manner worthy of the company's name.

			 

Founded by Financial Professionals:

Daniel Wildermuth and Carol Wildermuth, co-founders of Kalos Financial, opened their doors to advisors in 2004. Daniel and Carol have decades of experience in the financial services industry, including experience advising clients. This provides them with a unique understanding and perspective because they have first-hand knowledge of what it takes to manage a successful practice.

			 

An Innovative Force within the Financial Services Industry:

A New and Intelligent Approach to Investing

	Today’s high net-worth investors possess a much greater financial literacy than previous generations. With this level of sophistication, investors seek products and strategies that can potentially offer greater degrees of flexibility, intelligent diversification, tax efficiency and more control over their invested assets – and that’s what investors find when working with Kalos advisors. Our firm was founded on the principles reflected in the meaning of our name – that which is intrinsically fair, right and honorable. Our commitment to serve your advisor with integrity and provide products and strategies to meet the needs of our advisors’ clients, is our focus each and every day.
 
Founded by Financial Professionals
Daniel Wildermuth and Carol Wildermuth, co-founders of Kalos Financial, opened their doors to advisors in 2004.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
