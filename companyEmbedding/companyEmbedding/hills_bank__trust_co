Frequently Asked Questions about Hills Bank OnlineTM

How will I log in the first time?
You will enter your current online banking Login ID and Password into the login screen, and then click Sign In.
This will take you to a screen that asks you to select how you would like to receive a Secure Access Code. This is a one-time-use code provided using phone numbers we already have on file. It helps us protect the privacy and security of your information. For this reason, it is important that we have a number at which you can be reached during the times you will access Hills Bank Online. The last four digits of phone and/or text options available for receipt of your secure access code are listed. Click on your selection. If none of these numbers are valid, you will need to call us at 1-800-445-5725 and we will assist you in obtaining your code.
You will then be directed to a screen that allows you to input the secure access code that you will have just received, either as text or an automated phone call at the number you selected.
Once you have entered your access code and clicked Submit", you will be prompted to change your password. Your new password must be between 5-15 characters long and must contain a minimum of one number.
Once your password is reset, you'll see a screen displaying your contact information. Please review this information and the terms and conditions of online banking. You are now ready to being online banking.

About Us






Since our beginnings in 1904, Hills Bank has been filled with insightful visionaries, determined co-workers, and loyal shareholders who have helped mold the rich culture and unique history that we enjoy today. Through the years, Hills Bank has remained committed to its most valuable asset — our customers and employees.
Today, Hills Bank and Trust Company has grown to become one of Iowa's largest independent banks. We have achieved this growth the old-fashioned way — by earning our customers' respect, one at a time. We were founded on the principle that banks should care about the people they serve and provide ways to help them prosper. With our large asset base and community orientation, we offer the advantages of a large regional bank while maintaining the responsiveness of a smaller community bank.
We hope you will allow us the opportunity to show you the Hills Bank way of doing business.

Reasonably good benefits. Paid holidays.ConsWorst management I've ever encountered. Upper management is chummy, friendly, and alienating towards new hires. Supervisors use their positions as leverage over lower-tier employees. Heavily conservative (socially and politically); minimally diverse, with zero privacy, and supervisors made sure that everyone knew when someone had done something wrong (humiliation, passive aggression, and endless gossip about previous and current employees was the norm).The pay is terrible. For what employees do, they are paid next to nothing. The sales incentive program is nonsense. Full time employees must sell three items per quarter to qualify for a minuscule bonus.The only way someone can advance in this company is if they have longevity. Talent, skill, and experience count for nothing; if you've been with the company for years, then you will benefit. If not, you will stay where you are.Advice to ManagementGrow up. Behave like the professionals you claim to be. Hold yourself to the same standards as you hold your employees.When customers behave in unacceptable ways (harassing employees; being racist and sexist) hold them accountable.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Hills Bank & Trust Co.

Some of my closest friends came from Hills Bank, and I am eternally grateful for that. They also pay their part-time employees very well. A great place to work while going to school.ConsThe reason you create such good relationship with your coworkers, is because you all have something in common: you are all going through the ridiculous tasks customers and management is making you do. I understand customer service is important, but when I have been drilled to do something a certain way, and you tell a customer no, they freak out. After that, those customers go and complain to management saying "this is the last time we will do this for you" (but it never is). These are then the people who will be "grading" you on your performance which effects everyone's pay raises and bonuses.Hills also will not write you recommendation letters or provide referrals once you are prepared to get a job in the real world. Getting a degree then going to work at Hills is completely irrelevant, because to them the amount of time you have been there is better than your knowledge on how things actually are suppose to work. They claim they won't write references because "they don't want to lose good employees", but they don't treat their good employees good at all. But why would you stay when you walk in there with a finance or accounting degree and they would say "okay you can be a teller and have to work your way up".I think there is a chance that every teller supervisor (that I have at least encountered) have some form of a mood disorder. You never know what supervisor you are encountering when you walk into the office that day. Even though hard workers will leave a branch because of a certain teller supervisor (and many of them have at the NL Zeller Branch and the CV branch) they won't do anything about it.Advice to ManagementRemember that STUDENTS full-time job is being a student, and respect that fact. Don't try and con them into working 30+ hours and never giving them time off during finals. Also, please remember that treating your tellers well is sometimes more important than making a customer happy. That's probably why you have so much turnover, and no one wanting to work their way up.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Hills Bank & Trust Co.

They have a great internal hiring process and there are always opportunities to apply for new positions within the organization, so it's a great place to start if you aren't sure what you would enjoy in banking. They offer great benefits and opportunities range from high school/GED level to MBA/CPA level of jobs.ConsThe headquarters, located in Hills, Iowa, is inconvenient for employees who don't live close to the Iowa City area.

Low pay and minimal raises. Not much room for career advancement. Don't encourage further education. Value longevity at company over efficiency. Seems to be a social hierarchy which affects advancement. Supervisors often don't let younger employees have any real responsibilities or room for growth. Very, very conservative for the most part. Inability to hire the correct people or the correct amount of people: in the summer, they often hire temps, even though regular FT employees already have little to do, then will lessen the hours of FT employees, b/c they don't have enough work.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Hills Bank & Trust Co.

Reasonably good benefits. Paid holidays.ConsWorst management I've ever encountered. Upper management is chummy, friendly, and alienating towards new hires. Supervisors use their positions as leverage over lower-tier employees. Heavily conservative (socially and politically); minimally diverse, with zero privacy, and supervisors made sure that everyone knew when someone had done something wrong (humiliation, passive aggression, and endless gossip about previous and current employees was the norm).The pay is terrible. For what employees do, they are paid next to nothing. The sales incentive program is nonsense. Full time employees must sell three items per quarter to qualify for a minuscule bonus.The only way someone can advance in this company is if they have longevity. Talent, skill, and experience count for nothing; if you've been with the company for years, then you will benefit. If not, you will stay where you are.Advice to ManagementGrow up. Behave like the professionals you claim to be. Hold yourself to the same standards as you hold your employees.When customers behave in unacceptable ways (harassing employees; being racist and sexist) hold them accountable.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Hills Bank & Trust Co.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.
