Press Releases



Dehaier Medical Systems Ltd. Cooperates with China Sciences Group (Holding) Co., Ltd. to Enter China's Elderly Sleep Apnea Market






Jul 7, 2016, 10:00am EDT














BEIJING, China, July 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dehaier Medical Systems Ltd. (NASDAQ: DHRM) ("Dehaier" or the "Company"), which develops, markets and sells medical devices and wearable sleep respiratory products in China, announced on July 5, 2016 that it is partnering with China Sciences Group (Holding) Co., Ltd. ("China Sciences") to enter the Chinese pension and health industry by providing Dehaier's products through China Sciences' elder care platform. In connection with this announcement, Dehaier, China Sciences and another supplier, Chia Tai Pharmaceutical Group ("Chia Tai"), have signed a strategic cooperation agreement to launch the "Elderly Sleep Apnea Comprehensive Disease Solution Project" (the "Project"). The Project will leverage China Sciences' "Hui Kang" cloud-based health management platform to provide Dehaier's and Chia Tai's medical devices to the elderly.
China Sciences is a state-owned enterprise, organized under the auspices of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ("CAS"). With total assets of nearly RMB 10 billion, China Sciences' health pension model enjoys brand and research support from CAS. The Hui Kang "Internet + Medical Support" business model will benefit users of Dehaier's smart wearables with a large, well-received platform. Hui Kang integrates a variety of localized health and pension service organizations and has grown to cover more than 300 cities in more than 20 provinces and serve nearly one million members since the start of October 2014. The Project is expected to reach approximately 100 health and pension service institutions in 2016, and 600 in 2017.
Dehaier will provide wearable sleep respiratory products through the Hui Kang platform. In particular, Dehaier expects to offer its wearable sleep respiratory products and home ventilator products, which facilitate diagnosis, therapy, treatment evaluation and case management. Dehaier expects the Hui Kang platform will increase the number of potential end users and the quality of contact with those users. The integration of patient medical information with an online platform is designed to improve patient treatment outcomes and reduce elderly end users' personal medical expenses by avoiding unnecessary or duplicative treatment and medications. 
Chia Tai sells a wide range of products including diabetic special dietary products and chronic disease management programs. Chia Tai's end user target market overlaps with Dehaier's, while its products do not overlap. As a result, Dehaier expects that the sale of Chia Tai's products through the Hui Kang platform will benefit both parties by cross-referring both companies' customers to each other, without selling competing products. 
Dehaier CEO Mr. Chen Ping said: "As China's population ages, we believe the pension and health industry is likely to grow. According to the latest statistics of National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China, China's population over the age of 60 is expected to grow from approximately 220 million people in 2015 to about 440 million in 2050. Since between 20% and 40% of the elderly population suffers from some level of sleep apnea, we expect that a growing elderly population may increase our industry's potential market size to nearly $2 billion by 2050."
About Dehaier Medical Systems Ltd.
Dehaier Medical Systems Ltd. was founded in 2003 and provides comprehensive solutions for people affected by sleep apnea syndrome, including diagnosis, treatment and efficacy assessment. The company has advanced production equipment, a sophisticated R&D team and professional sales and marketing personnel.

Currently, Dehaier has five sales platforms - public hospitals, private medical examination groups, pension and health management services institutions, insurance companies and individual users. Dehaier Medical's technology is based on six patents and eleven software copyrights. More information may be found at http://www.dehaier.com.cn.

The Group has total assets of nearly RMB 10 billion. Its "Hui Kang" health management cloud platform integrated numerous localized health and pension services organizations.
