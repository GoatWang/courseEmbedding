    The Right Shell Lubricant For Your Vehicle/Equipment | Shell ROTELLA®                                                Skip to main content        Home - Shell ROTELLA®           Search     What are you looking for?     Submit      Top searches   Your recent searches                                 What do you drive?    Consider your vehicle/equipment and what it means to you and your business. You are pressed to keep it on the road while at the same time managing your overall costs. Shell Lubricants can play a key role in helping you manage those costs, which can set you apart from your neighbor or competitor. Here is an example of how Shell Lubricants can provide value to you.                 Diesel Pickup              However Tough, Shell ROTELLA® Adapts You need to know your oil will protect your engine under all driving conditions. No matter how hot, cold, steep, dusty, muddy or extended your operations, you demand protection. PROVEN PERFORMANCE Diesel engines are a special breed, providing more power and higher torque, but with higher compression ratios. They also produce more soot. And the new, lower-emission diesels can run at extremely high temperatures, shearing oil at a much higher rate. Shell ROTELLA® Energized Protection™ adaptive technology offers the advanced protection your diesel pickup engine demands, without compromising performance. And it’s proven itself again and again—in the lab and in miles of real-world experience. Shell ROTELLA® T Triple Protection® formulation has seen over 40 million miles of on-highway testing. That means it’s shown outstanding performance even when it’s subjected to high engine and oil temperatures, which causes extra soot and acids to be dumped into the oil. That’s a lot for an oil to deal with. Once an oil can protect in the most extreme conditions, then we’re satisfied it can protect in your truck. The Shell ROTELLA® family of heavy duty engine oils delivers the right performance for your diesel pickup truck. From Shell ROTELLA® T Triple Protection®, to Shell ROTELLA® T5 Synthetic Blend Technology, to Full Synthetic Shell ROTELLA® T6 Full Synthetic Heavy Duty Engine oils, no matter what you drive, your engine gets the Energized Protection™ performance that meets its needs.     SHELL ROTELLA® PRODUCTS  VISGRADES  BENEFITS   Shell ROTELLA® T6 Full Synthetic Heavy Duty Engine Oil SAE 5W40 CJ-4     Shell ROTELLA® T6 can help improve the fuel efficiency of your vehicle. Developed in close cooperation with leading engine and vehicle makers, it not only offers possible fuel-economy benefits*, but also the durability and performance demands of the latest low-emission diesel pickups. Shell ROTELLA® T6 can help improve fuel efficiency through lower viscous friction in lubricated contacts and by reducing the energy used to pump the oil through the engine. Shell studies show that fuel savings of up to 1.5% are possible.* For a typical truck** covering 40,000 miles per year, that’s a saving of approximately 46 gallons of diesel fuel. At $2.50 a gallon, that’s a saving of $115 per truck per year.      Shell ROTELLA® T5 Synthetic Blend Technology Heavy Duty Engine Oil SAE 10W-30 CJ-4 SAE 10W-40 CJ-4 Shell ROTELLA® T5 can help provide energy-saving benefits and is one of the most innovative heavy duty engine oils developed by Shell Lubricants. Shell ROTELLA® T5 is designed to provide fuel-economy savings, extended-drain capability, enhanced engine cleanliness, and excellent wear protection.   Shell ROTELLA® T Triple Protection Heavy Duty Engine Oil SAE 15W-40 10W-30 Shell ROTELLA® T Triple Protection® meets or exceeds API CJ-4 requirements and is designed to provide triple-action performance to help control wear, deposits and emissions. Tested in over 50 million miles of on- and off-road late-model engines, it offers up to 38% lower iron wear compared to Shell ROTELLA® T CI-4 PLUS, and up to 22% less iron wear than Shell ROTELLA® T3 15W-40 API CJ-4.

Savings on maintenance cost: Shell field engineers made a thorough evaluation of equipment and oil usage at a customer’s site. Using their experience, they recommended switching from a competitive oil to Shell heavy duty engine oils with higher protection levels. Savings were realized in terms of total cost of lubricants, oil filters, manpower and other oil-change-related costs. Aside from savings, increased availability of the equipment for use in timely completion of projects was realized. Savings on overhauling cost: One of our customers was planning to overhaul the engines in two dump trucks. We suggested an inspection of the engines using Shell LubeVideoCheck. After the inspection, we found that one of the engines was still in condition and did not need dismantling and overhaul at the present time. Through the use of Shell LubeVideoCheck, time and money were saved.  Shell Lubricants can work with you to assess your individual operations and determine what value we can deliver for your business.
