Investment Grade Income Trust, 7-13 Year Series 49 Investment Grade Income Trust, 7-13 Year Series 49 invests in a portfolio of intermediate-term corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds, including Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 514. Monthly Distributions Estimated Current Return: 3.84% Estimated Long Term Return: 3.39% Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.3 You should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference. July 27, 2015 The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of the Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. Any contrary representation is a criminal offense. INVESCO Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of intermediate-term corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds, including Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors, among others: o all ratings provided for the bonds must be at least "BBB-" if issued by either Standard & Poor's or Fitch Ratings, and at least "Baa3" if issued by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or, in the case of a bond with no issued ratings, such a bond has credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor; o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; o the current income provided by the bonds; o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer; and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to provisions in The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a subsidy payment from the United States Treasury ("Treasury") equal to 35% of the interest payable on such bonds, on or about each interest payment date (45% for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds). Build America Bonds must have been issued before January 1, 2011 to finance governmental purposes for which tax-exempt governmental bonds (excluding private activity bonds) could be issued, however the excess of available project proceeds over amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund may be used to finance only capital expenditures. Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. Qualified School Construction Bonds are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may be issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types. Generally, any Qualified Bond sale proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer three years after the issue date of such bonds will be redeemed within 90 days of the expiration of the three-year period. Federal legislation imposes requirements on Build America Bonds and Qualified Bonds that issuers must continue to meet in order to receive ongoing federal subsidy payments. The portfolio generally consists of corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds maturing approximately 7 to 13 years from the Date of Deposit. Following the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced, even to below "investment grade" ("BBB-" or "Baa3"), and the Trust could continue to hold such bond. See "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration". Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for reasons such as these: o Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over time. o The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future. o A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or principal payments in the future. In particular, should the issuer of a Build America Bond or Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the Recovery Act,4 it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. o The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period. o The financial markets, including those for corporate bonds, have recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility. Due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets, there can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuer's assets or the extent of its obligations. For these or other reasons, the ratings of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio may not accurately reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of the bond. o A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond. In particular, Qualified Bonds may be redeemed approximately three years after issuance to the extent an issuer has unexpended bond sale proceeds. If enough bonds are called, the Trust could terminate earlier than expected. o We do not actively manage the Trust's portfolio. Except in limited circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market value declines.

This could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates. (2) During the initial offering period, part of the value of the Units represents an amount of cash deposited to pay all or a portion of the costs of organizing the Trust. The estimated organization costs per Unit will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to any such reduction, these costs will not be deducted from the redemption proceeds. Organization costs are not included in the Public Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales5 charge. (3) After the first settlement date (July 30, 2015), you will pay accrued interest from this date to your settlement date less interest distributions. (4) This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than organization costs. Organization costs are not deducted from interest income. (5) Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your Trust assesses other fees per Unit. (6) We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.

Notes to Portfolio (1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from July 17, 2015 to July 27, (2) The Offering Price to Trust of the bonds is based on the offering side valuation as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit determined by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider, on the basis set forth under "Public Offering--Unit Price". In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Trust's investments are classified as Level 2, which refers to security prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted market prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk. The cost of the bonds to the Sponsor for the Trust is $5,757,725 and the Sponsor's profit or (loss) is $40,125. "+" indicates that the bond was issued by a foreign company. The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the first settlement date. "#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in "Federal Tax Status". (3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. "*" indicates a security rating by Fitch. "NR" indicates that the rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. (4) With respect to any bonds presenting a redemption feature in this column, this is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". (5) Certain bonds have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such bond, a "make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations or municipal obligations, as applicable, with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have7 been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the bonds being redeemed. In addition, the bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". Underwriting. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of condition is free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall statement of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of condition as of July 27, We believe that our audit of the statement of condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Investment Grade Income Trust, 7-13 Year Series 49 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 514) as of July 27, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The contracts to purchase bonds are collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient to satisfy such contracts. (2) The Trustee will advance the amount of the net interest accrued to the first settlement date to the Trust for distribution to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of such date. (3) A portion of the public offering price represents an amount of cash sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the Trust. The amount of these costs are set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information--Expenses". A distribution will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the close of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of the investors will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust. THE TRUSTS General. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee. Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds. In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors. On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial Information". The bonds initially consist of delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information". A Trust that holds primarily intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of the prospectus, is referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate Term Trust. Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of the Trust. The number of Units is determined based upon a $1,000 principal amount of bonds in the Trust per Unit. To the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement. Objective and Bond Selection. The objective of an Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors, among others: (a) the ratings criteria applicable to your Trust as listed under "Principal Investment Strategy", (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade Income Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement, which is available upon request, contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment. Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S. and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period, including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity. The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S. Federal9 Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings. Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund. Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price. These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies. The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts, currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets. Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments, including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in non-u.s. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the Trust's portfolio securities. Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies. Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most U.S. companies. Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest rates in the United States are at or near historic lows, which may increase the Trust's exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond. Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events. Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See "Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds" and "Taxable Municipal Bonds--Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds" below. The call provisions are described in general terms in the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section, and the notes thereto. Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described in the following sections. Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses. Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations.10 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net asset value. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the over-thecounter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry, many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a result of such illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests. Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds. Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment. The types of bonds in your Trust are listed under "Portfolio". These bonds are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement. General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. All other municipal bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds. Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes. The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment. Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors, some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations. Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types of financing projects that these obligations support vary. Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors (45 percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds). The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to have this subsection of the Code apply. Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on the bonds by the Code, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition, Build America Bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act) or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs. Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest payments. Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types. Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax11 credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section 54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs. Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds. Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid). Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation. Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions. Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally prepayable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies. Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks. Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility. Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing. Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels. Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks. Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds. Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed  View more

High Yield Corporate Trust, 4-7 Year Series 8 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  High Yield Corporate Trust, 4-7 Year Series 8 invests in a portfolio of high
yield corporate bonds, generally maturing approximately 4 to 7 years from the   
Date of Deposit. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and  
to preserve capital. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors--High Yield Bond Risk" for a 
discussion of the risks associated with investments in high yield bonds, also   
known as "junk" bonds. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in Invesco 
Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 581.                                         

August 10, 2016 

You should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of the 
Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. 
Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.

INVESCO                                                                         

Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current  
income and to preserve capital.                                                 

Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of high   
yield corporate bonds maturing approximately 4 to 7 years from the Date of      
Deposit. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor considered the following 
factors, among others:                                                          

o    each rated bond must either have a rating of at least "CCC-" by  
     Standard & Poor's or Fitch Ratings, or, have a rating of at least
       "Caa3" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or, in the case of a bond
        with no issued ratings, such a bond must have credit characteristics
        sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated
          as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Trust in the opinion of the
Sponsor;                                                    

    o    the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality
and maturity;                                               

o    the current income provided by the bonds;                        

  o    the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; and                                                 

  o    the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk.                                                       

Issuers of high yield bonds are often smaller, less-seasoned companies or 
companies that are highly leveraged with more traditional methods of financing  
unavailable to them. These bonds are almost always uncollateralized and         
subordinate to other debt that an issuer may have outstanding. Bonds rated      
below BBB- by either S&P or Fitch, or below Baa3 by Moody's, are considered     
speculative and subject to high credit risk and are vulnerable to adverse       
business, financial and economic conditions but currently have the capacity to  
meet financial commitments. Bonds rated CCC by either S&P or Fitch, or rated    
Caa by Moody's, are subject to very high credit risk and are at a substantial   
risk of default. See "Description of Ratings" for additional details.           

The portfolio generally consists of taxable bonds maturing approximately 4
to 7 years from the Date of Deposit. Following the Date of Deposit, a bond may  
cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced, and the Trust could continue to 
hold such bond. See "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration".           

  Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can     
happen for reasons such as these:                                               

     o    Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over
time.                                                       

o    The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in 
          general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in
    the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The
     negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate
        increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether
interest rates will rise or fall in the future.             

o    A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or   
principal payments in the future.                           

o    The Trust invests in bonds rated below investment grade and are  
     considered to be "junk" bonds. Bonds rated below "BBB-" by either
          Standard & Poor's or Fitch, or below "Baa3" by Moody's, are considered
  to be below investment grade. These bonds are considered to be
   speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks.
         Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than with investment grade
          bonds. In addition, these bonds may be more sensitive to interest rate
      changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal.
         These bonds may also be subject to liquidity risks greater than those
       typically attributable to investment grade bonds. The Trust's price
 per Unit, yield and return may fluctuate more than in a trust
consisting of investment grade bonds.                       

    o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
       may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
         may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering
period.                                                     

o    The financial markets, including those for corporate bonds, have 
       recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility.
         Due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets, there
        can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuer's
        assets or the extent of its obligations. For these or other reasons,
        the ratings of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio may not accurately
         reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of
the bond.                                                   

o    A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated    
         maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to
        you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price
could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond.   

o    Certain of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio are restricted     
          securities that may be subject to enhanced liquidity risk. This is the
          risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security
          is limited or absent. Any bonds in the Trust designated as "Rule 144A"
          securities are subject to resale restrictions. The value of your Units
       may decrease if there is, for any reason, a lack of a liquid market
for these securities.                                       

  o    Bonds of foreign issuers in the Trust present risks beyond those of
      U.S. issuers. These risks may include market and political factors
          related to an issuer's foreign market, international trade conditions,
          less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility,
      differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign
currencies.                                                 

 o    We do not actively manage the Trust's portfolio. Except in limited
        circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market
value declines.

==========================================================================================================================

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.    

(2)  During the initial offering period, part of the value of the Units         
     represents an amount of cash deposited to pay all or a portion of the costs
    of organizing the Trust. The estimated organization costs per Unit will be
  deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of six months after
     the Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period. If Units are
     redeemed prior to any such reduction, these costs will not be deducted from
    the redemption proceeds. Organization costs are not included in the Public
Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge. 

(3)  After the first settlement date (August 15, 2016), you will pay accrued    
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than organization    
costs. Organization costs are not deducted from interest income.      

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.                                   

(6)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.  

(7)  Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each  
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the  
estimated return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this  
   estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This
   estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive
    the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its
   value and estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long
   term return accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds.
   These estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No
   return calculation can predict your actual return. Your actual return may
vary from these estimates.

For an explanation of the footnotes used on this page, see "Notes to Portfolio".

Notes to Portfolio                                                              

(1)  The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for  
    the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
     affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from August 8, 2016
to August 9, 2016.                                                    

(2)  The Offering Price to Trust of the bonds is based on the offering side     
   valuation as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit determined
    by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider, on the basis set forth
 under "Public Offering--Unit Price". In accordance with FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and  
Disclosures, the Trust's investments are classified as Level 2, which 
 refers to security prices determined using other significant observable
   inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would
use in pricing a security. These may include quoted market prices for 
    similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk. The
cost of the bonds to the Sponsor for the Trust is $11,019,171 and the 
Sponsor's profit or (loss) is $56,485.                                

"+" indicates that the bond was issued by a foreign company.          

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate 
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the 
corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is  
included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the   
     maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed
    delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of
    Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to
take place at various dates after the first settlement date.          

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an 
    original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". The tax effect of
 bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in "Federal Tax
Status".                                                              

(3)  "o" indicates that the rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating     
  agency of a policy of insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. All
ratings are by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively, unless    
otherwise indicated. "*" indicates a security rating by Fitch. "NR"   
   indicates that the rating service did not provide a rating for that bond.
For a brief description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings".  

(4)  With respect to any bonds presenting a redemption feature in this column,  
    this is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at   
   declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
 price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
     date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
subsequent years. To the extent bonds were deposited in the Trust at a
     price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent
    a loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of
 the Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the
    income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed bonds
     and Unitholders will receive a distribution of the principal amount and any
   premium received on such redemption (except to the extent the proceeds of
the redeemed bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions). The Trust's 
     Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long Term Return amounts may also be
affected by such redemptions. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is      
established with respect to an issue of bonds. The bonds may also be  
     subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary
optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors--Call Risk".                                     

(5)  Certain bonds have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in whole  
  or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price
    that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such bond, a
 "make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
  redemption. The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if
 any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of
    principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest
accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if    
redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining 
    principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond
     and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations
with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a
     premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have
   been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate
  principal amount of the bonds being redeemed. In addition, the bonds may
also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to 
  extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur.
See "The Trusts--Risk Factors--Call Risk".                            

(6)  This is a restricted security that may only be resold pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See "Risk Factors".     

(7)  This bond is subject to interest rate adjustments based on ratings events, 
  and accordingly, its interest rate has been increased due to a series of
  ratings downgrades. The interest rate payable on this bond is subject to
    further potential interest rate adjustments, not to exceed 2.00 percentage
    points above the bond's original interest rate of 5.25%, if either Moody's
     or Standard & Poor's (or, in certain limited circumstances, another ratings
service) adjusts their rating for this bond. In particular, any future
  credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the interest rate
payable on this bond. The interest rate set forth here represents the 
current interest rate applicable to the bond.                         

Underwriting. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the    
following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal            
underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".

(included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 581):                   

We have audited the accompanying statement of condition including the     
related portfolio of High Yield Corporate Trust, 4-7 Year Series 8 (included in 
Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 581) as of August 10, 2016. The      
statement of condition is the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit.     

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public     
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require     
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of condition is free of material misstatement. We were not        
engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal control over financial      
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial  
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting.         
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of 
condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates   
made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall statement of condition   
presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York    
Mellon, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the   
purchase of securities as shown in the statement of condition as of August 10,
2016. We believe that our audit of the statement of condition provides a        
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents     
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of High Yield          
Corporate Trust, 4-7 Year Series 8 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable    
Income Series 581) as of August 10, 2016, in conformity with accounting         
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  The value of the bonds is determined by Standard & Poor's Securities       
Evaluations, Inc. on the bases set forth under "Public Offering--Unit
Price". The contracts to purchase bonds are collateralized by an      
irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient to satisfy such  
contracts.

Unitholder of record as of such date.                                 

(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount of cash        
sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in       
establishing the Trust. The amount of these costs are set forth under 
     "Summary of Essential Financial Information--Expenses". A distribution will
  be made as of the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the
close of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the  
 Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of the investors
will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the
Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated       
     organization costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to
the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust.                

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York   
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Invesco Capital Markets,  
Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, 
Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York        
Mellon, as Trustee.                                                             

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to       
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

  On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate
principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". The bonds initially consist of delivery statements relating to    
contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable      
letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee,   
in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of    
the number of Units indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". A Trust that holds primarily bonds within the 4 to 7 year         
maturity range, as described on the cover of the prospectus, is referred to     
herein as a "High Yield Trust". Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, 
the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the 
twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of a High Yield Trust.       

Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in 
the principal and net income of the Trust. The number of Units is determined    
based upon a $1,000 principal amount of bonds in the Trust per Unit. To the     
extent that any Units are redeemed to the Trustee, the fractional undivided     
interest in the Trust represented by each Unit will increase, although the      
actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain           
outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust 
Agreement.                                                                      

Objective and Bond Selection. The objective of a High Yield Trust is to   
provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in  
a portfolio primarily consisting of high yield corporate bonds maturing         
approximately 4 to 7 years from the Date of Deposit. There is, of course, no    
guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an         
appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a     
portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be 
able to acquire individually.                                                   

In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: (a) the ratings criteria applicable to your Trust as     
listed under "Principal Investment Strategy"; (b) the prices of the bonds       
relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; (c) the current     
income provided by the bonds; (d) the liquidity of the bonds; (e) whether the   
bonds are designated as "Rule 144A" restricted securities; (f) recent trading   
activity of the bonds; (g) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue  
and location of issuer; and (h) the probability of early return of principal or 
high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be     
rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of 
Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be   
considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the    
Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                               

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your           
investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement, 
which is available upon request, contains a more detailed discussion of risks   
related to your investment.                                                     

Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States  
which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the     
U.S. and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary     
period, including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic   
activity. The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps 
to combat the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of    
these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the     
U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing  
program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future 
changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest      
rates over the previous five years.                                             

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

High Yield Bond Risk. The Trust invests exclusively in high yield bonds.  
High yield, or "junk" bonds, are frequently issued by corporations in the       
growth stage of their development or by established companies who are highly    
leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed. High yield bonds are 
rated below BBB- by either S&P or Fitch, or below Baa3 by Moody's, and are      
considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality below investment     
grade. For additional information regarding ratings definitions, see            
"Description of Ratings".                                                       

The prices of and yields on high yield bonds may fluctuate to a greater   
extent than those of higher rated bonds. Because high yield bonds are generally 
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than      
higher rated bonds, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds 
and are affected by economic, political, regulatory, company-specific and       
short-term credit developments to a greater degree. Their values can decline    
significantly over short periods of time or during periods of economic          
difficulty when the bonds could be difficult to value or sell at a fair price.  

High yield bonds are also subject to greater credit risk (including the   
possibility of an issuer's default or bankruptcy) than bonds in higher rating   
categories. An economic slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's                 
creditworthiness, may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at 
a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments. The risk of     
default among high yield bonds is also enhanced since these securities are      
generally subordinated obligations within an issuer's overall capital           
structure. Generally, no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness      
(such as a high yield bond in the Trust) may be made while there exists a       
default with respect to any senior indebtedness. Thus, in the event of          
insolvency, holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover  
more, ratably, than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer.        

  Should the issuer of any high yield bond default in the payment of principal
or interest, the Trust may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the     
defaulted bond. Because amounts (if any) recovered by the Trust in payment      
under the defaulted bond may not be reflected in the value of the Trust's Units 
until actually received by the Trust, and depending upon when a Unitholder      
purchases or sells his or her Units, it is possible that a Unitholder would     
bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the     
payment recovered.                                                              

The market for high yield bonds is smaller and less liquid than that for  
investment grade bonds. High yield bonds are generally not listed on a national 
securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets. Due to the       
smaller, less liquid market for high yield bonds, the bid-offer spread on such  
bonds is generally greater than it is for investment grade bonds and the        
purchase or sale of such bonds may take longer to complete. Further, the Trust  
may have difficulty selling certain high yield bonds at the desired time and    
price. Less liquidity could adversely affect the price at which the Trust could 
sell a particular high yield bond, and could cause significant fluctuations in  
the net asset value of the Trust's Units. The lack of a liquid trading market   
may also make it more difficult for the Trust to obtain accurate market         
quotations from the Evaluator in valuing high yield bonds. Accordingly,         
elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation in the rare           
circumstance that fair valuation methods are utilized.                          

Certain of the high yield bonds in the Trust are designated as "Rule 144A"
restricted securities ("Rule 144A securities") pursuant to the Securities Act   
of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), and may be subject to enhanced liquidity      
risk. Restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated            
transactions or in a public offering with respect to a registration statement   
which is in effect under the 1933 Act. Rule 144A securities are restricted      
securities that may only be resold in accordance with the applicable provisions 
of the 1933 Act. Rule 144A establishes a "safe harbor" from the registration    
requirements of the 1933 Act permitting the resale of restricted securities by  
the Trust to qualified institutional buyers. The only restricted securities in  
which the Trust invests are Rule 144A securities.                               

 Subsequently, the overall liquidity of the Trust may decrease to the extent
the Trust's restricted securities (or any of the Trust's high yield bonds) are  
not readily marketable or become illiquid at the time the Trust may be seeking  
to sell such securities, such as for a request for redemption. An insufficient  
number of qualified institutional buyers interested in purchasing restricted    
securities held by the Trust may adversely affect the marketability of such     
securities, and the Trustee might be unable to dispose of any illiquid Trust    
securities promptly or at reasonable prices. Since it is not possible to        
predict with assurance exactly how the market for a particular high yield or    
Rule 144A restricted security will develop, the Sponsor will carefully monitor  
all the Trust's investments, focusing on such factors, among others, as         
valuation, liquidity and availability of information.                           

In the extraordinary circumstance where registration is required for the  
resale of a restricted security, additional expenses may be incurred and a      
considerable period may elapse from the time the Trustee attempts to sell such  
restricted Trust securities and the time the Trustee may be permitted to sell   
the restricted Trust securities under an effective registration statement.      
Under circumstances such as these, the Trustee may experience difficulty        
satisfying redemptions within three business days when faced with periods of    
enhanced illiquidity.                                                           

 Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves
more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks   
can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price.   
These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and     
social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including   
withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of          
securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or         
repatriation of currencies.                                                     

 The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in     
these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts, 
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is   
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company  
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.   
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult 
for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with       
respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments,      
including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional     
conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and       
securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in   
non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have 
on the Trust's portfolio securities.                                            

Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,  
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.     
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies  
than about most U.S. companies.                                                 

Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more   
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable 
to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.           

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity    
are often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest rates in the United 
States are at or near historic lows, which may increase the Trust's exposure to 
risks associated with rising interest rates.                                    

Certain bonds in your Trust may be subject to interest rate adjustments if
either Moody's or Standard & Poor's (or, in certain limited circumstances,      
another ratings service) downgrades the rating for such bond (or upgrades the   
rating after such a downgrade). The interest rates payable on certain bonds in  
your Trust may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades. Any  
future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the  
interest rates payable on such bonds and, consequently, may adversely affect    
both the income you receive from the securities in the Trust and the value of   
your Units. On the other hand, increases in a bond's interest rate related to   
decreases in such bond's credit rating may place additional financial strain on 
the bond's issuer which could result in further decreases in financial          
condition and further credit rating decreases. Additionally, an increase in a   
bond's interest rate may increase the risk that the bond's issuer will prepay   
or "call" the bond before its stated maturity.                                  

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the     
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the     
original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the     
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might    
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price  
could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below    
the bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount    
you paid for your Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust   
could terminate early.                                                          

Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or 
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax   
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the    
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other        
events. The call provisions are described in general terms in the "Redemption   
Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section, and the notes thereto.              

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified   
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of    
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be             
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described in the 
following sections.                                                             

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net      
asset value. The market for certain investments may become less liquid or       
illiquid due to adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer or due 
to adverse market or economic conditions. In the absence of a liquid trading    
market for a particular security, the price at which such security may be sold  
to meet redemptions, as well as the value of the Units of your Trust, may be    
adversely affected. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will      
exist for any bond in the Trust because these bonds all generally trade in the  
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange). In the  
event that any bond becomes illiquid, the Trustee may have to sell other or     
additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests. Additional        
discussion of liquidity as it relates to high yield bonds is included in the    
"High Yield Bond Risk" section above.                                           

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

Corporate Bond Industry Risks. Your Trust may invest significantly in     
certain industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a     
greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over       
several industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before  
you invest.                                                                     

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Your Trust may invest
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various     
consumer products. General risks of these companies include the overall state   
of the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in  
the economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can    
negatively impact spending habits. Global factors including political           
developments, imposition of import controls, fluctuations in oil prices, and    
changes in exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and 
services.                                                                       

  Competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for
the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track    
the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell  
their products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers,   
but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive. Changes in      
demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the        
success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Consumer         
products and services companies may be subject to government regulation         
affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact             
performance. Tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws,           
regulations and litigation.                                                     

Financial Services Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by financial services companies. Companies in the financial services     
industry include, but are not limited to, companies involved in activities such 
as banking, mortgage finance, consumer finance, specialized finance, industrial 
finance and leasing, investment banking and brokerage, asset management and     
custody, corporate lending, insurance, and financial investment and real        
estate, including real estate investment trusts. In general, financial services 
issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market            
conditions, including: the liquidity and volatility levels in the global        
financial markets; interest rates, as well as currency and commodities prices;  
investor sentiment; the rate of corporate and consumer defaults; inflation and  
unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; exposure to      
various geographic markets or in commercial and residential real estate;        
competition from new entrants in their fields of business; extensive government 
regulation; and the overall health of the U.S. and international economies.     

 The financial services sector was adversely affected by global developments
stemming from the financial crisis including recessionary conditions,           
deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt. 
A substantial amount of assets were written down by financial institutions,     
with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large traditional banks,    
investment banks, broker-dealers and insurers into liquidation, combination or  
other restructuring. This also significantly increased the credit risk, and     
possibility of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these   
problems. In addition, the liquidity of certain debt instruments has been       
reduced or eliminated due to the lack of available market makers. While the     
U.S. and foreign governments, and their respective government agencies, have    
taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial     
institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated with          
investment in financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these     
steps.                                                                          

Most financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental   
regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn  
a profit from a given line of business. Challenging economic and political      
conditions, along with increased public scrutiny during the past several years, 
have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad,    
creating additional difficulties for financial institutions. Regulatory         
initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be    
inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services       
issuers are currently subject, thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal 
costs, as well as the potential for higher operational, capital and liquidity   
costs. Proposed or enacted regulations may further limit the amounts and types  
of loans and other financial commitments certain financial services issuers can 
make, and further, may limit the interest rates and fees they can charge, the   
prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. These laws 
and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial           
institution does business and the products and services it may provide.         
Increased regulation may restrict a company's ability to compete in its current 
businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses. New regulations may      
reduce or limit a company's revenue or impose additional fees, limit the scope  
of their activities, increase assessments or taxes on those companies and       
intensify regulatory supervision, adversely affecting business operations or    
leading to other negative consequences.                                         

Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial    
crisis has been the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act   
(the "Dodd-Frank Act"), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The          
Dodd-Frank Act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to   
address emerging risks and issues in the nation's evolving financial system. It 
also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as    
systemic risk regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight, and    
federal consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover virtually  
all participants in the financial services industry for years to come,          
including banks, thrifts, depository institution holding companies, mortgage    
lenders, insurance companies, industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and     
other securities and investment advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds, 
consumers, numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure. In   
particular, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital       
requirements of certain financial services companies supervised by the Federal  
Reserve, resulting in such companies incurring generally higher deposit         
premiums. These types of regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain 
issuers in your Trust, and could lead to decreases in such issuers' profits or  
revenues. In many cases the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on a financial    
institution's business remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making   
still to be completed. The Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of  
the Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, on the securities in your     
Trust or on the financial services industry in general.                         

Financial services companies in foreign countries are also subject to     
regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in  
certain foreign countries may include controls on interest rates, credit        
availability, prices and currency transfers. Negative developments regarding    
Eurozone sovereign debt, including the potential for further downgrades of      
sovereign credit ratings, as well as downgrades to the ratings of the U.S.      
government's sovereign credit rating, could adversely affect financial services 
issuers. In addition, the departure of any Eurozone country from use of the     
Euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges, operations and     
settlements, which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers.    

 The financial condition of customers, clients and counterparties, including
other financial institutions, could adversely affect financial services         
issuers. Financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of market      
making, trading, clearing or other counterparty relationships. Many of these    
transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of    
the actions of, or deterioration in, the commercial soundness of other          
counterparty financial institutions. Economic and market conditions may         
increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer, client or      
counterparty default. Downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services    
issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity, cash flows, competitive      
position, financial condition and results of operations by significantly        
limiting access to funding or capital markets, increasing borrowing costs or    
triggering increased collateral requirements. Financial services issuers face   
significant legal risk, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings, as 
well as private actions. Profit margins of these companies continue to shrink   
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital  
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.            

Banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory  
changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products.        
Technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut        
overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data. Banks continue to  
face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial 
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were              
traditionally offered by banks. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the  
availability and cost of capital funds, and may fluctuate significantly when    
interest rates change or due to increased competition. Further, economic        
conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on   
certain banks and savings associations. Declining real estate values could      
adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other    
lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value   
of real estate.                                                                 

 Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the  
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of 
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and 
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely 
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these           
companies.                                                                      

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium   
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, terrorism, weather catastrophes   
or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may  
be exposed to risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect   
from reinsurance carriers. Life and health insurance companies may be affected  
by mortality and morbidity rates, including the effect of epidemics. Insurance  
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the       
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of  
business. Insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition.       
Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance       
companies' policy sales, tax obligations and profitability.                     

 Health Care Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
health care companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced     
medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care,         
hospital management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face  
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. General risks of     
health care companies include extensive competition, product liability          
litigation and evolving government regulation.                                  

 On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the 
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on  
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a   
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant          
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage 
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible   
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,  
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also        
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,    
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing           
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until    
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and            
significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased 
costs and changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict   
the full impact of the Act on the Securities in your Trust.                     

As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose         
legislative action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may   
span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may       
include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for           
competition in the provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid     
health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the      
health care sector. The government could also reduce funding for health care    
related research.                                                               

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product          
obsolescence, increased government regulation, termination of patent protection 
for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come 
to market. The research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical 
product to market are substantial. This process involves lengthy government     
review with no guarantee of approval. These companies may have losses and may   
not offer proposed products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain   
approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a  
company and its stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also   
subject to risks of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other       
litigation.                                                                     

Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, 
the ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis 
on outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,    
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers    
and government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible         
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of      
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar          
programs).                                                                      

 Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the       
general state of the economy, intense competition, imposition of import         
controls, volatility in commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuation,   
consolidation, labor relations, domestic and international politics, excess     
capacity and consumer spending trends. Companies in the industrials sector may  
be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product         
liability claims. Capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by 
overall capital spending and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical        
obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key materials,  
depletion of resources, government regulations, government contracts and        
e-commerce initiatives.                                                         

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, changes in government budget priorities, changes   
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment 
manufacturers. Stocks of transportation companies are cyclical and can be       
significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices and insurance costs.    
Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to            
significant government regulation and oversight, which may negatively impact    
their businesses.                                                               

Materials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by 
companies in the materials industry. Companies in the materials sector could be 
adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import        
controls and increased competition. Production of materials often exceeds       
demand as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns, leading to poor       
investment returns. Companies in the materials sector are at risk for           
environmental damage and product liability claims. Companies in the materials   
sector may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, technical progress, 
labor relations, and governmental regulations.                                  

Telecommunications Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by telecommunications companies. This sector is primarily characterized  
by extensive government regulation and intense competition.                     

 Companies in the telecommunications industry allocate significant resources
in efforts to comply with applicable government regulations. Telecommunications 
companies operating in the U.S. must comply with applicable state and federal   
regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission. The      
costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive  
required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulatory        
requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications           
companies. Recent industry consolidation trends may lead to increased           
regulation in primary markets. Internationally, telecommunications companies    
may face regulatory challenges such as securing pre-marketing clearance of      
products and prices, which may be arbitrary and unpredictable. U.S. federal and 
state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services  
that a company may offer. U.S. federal legislation governing the                
telecommunications industry may become subject to judicial review and           
additional interpretation, which may adversely affect certain                   
telecommunications issuers.                                                     

The competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector is intense and 
constantly evolving. The products and services of these companies may become    
outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails 
to keep pace with technological advances. At the same time, demand for some     
telecommunications services remains weak, as several key markets are            
oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service providers   
and technology platforms. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to 
commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and 
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been          
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating  
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.     
Certain telecommunications companies may be engaged in fierce competition for a 
share of the market of their products and may have higher costs, including      
liabilities associated with the medical, pension and postretirement expenses of 
their workforce, than their competitors. As a result, competitive pressures are 
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility. Moreover,         
continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and  
delay, and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing       
operations and related risks, among other factors, could result in the failure  
of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies.               

Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in
the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the             
telecommunications industry. High debt loads that were accumulated during the   
industry growth spurt of the 1990s caught up to the industry, causing debt and  
stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications          
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced         
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the         
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Moreover, some companies have begun the process of   
emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other          
competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies. Due to these    
and other factors, the risk level of owning the securities of                   
telecommunications companies remains substantial and may continue to rise.      

  Information Technology Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by information technology companies. These companies include companies   
that are involved in computer and business services, enterprise                 
software/technical software, Internet and computer software, Internet-related   
services, networking and telecommunications equipment, telecommunications       
services, electronics products, server hardware, computer hardware and          
peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors. These          
companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology, rapid product      
obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and         
frequent new product introductions.                                             

Companies in this sector face risks from rapid changes in technology,     
competition, dependence on certain suppliers and supplies, rapid obsolescence   
of products or services, patent termination, cyclical market pattern, evolving  
industry standards, frequent new products and government regulation. These      
companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or reduction in supply 
of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply with certain       
industry standards.                                                             

  An unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on
a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies   
or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the 
company's results. Information technology companies may also be smaller and/or  
less experienced companies with limited product lines, markets or resources.    
Stocks of some Internet companies have high price-to-earnings ratios with       
little or no earnings histories. Information technology stocks tend to          
experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements  
about new products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can  
cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price  
and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a         
company. This can impact your ability to redeem your Units at a price equal to  
or greater than what you paid.                                                  

Energy Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by    
energy companies. Energy companies can be significantly impacted by             
fluctuations in the prices of energy fuels, such as crude oil, natural gas, and 
other fossil fuels. Extended periods of low energy fuel prices can have a       
material adverse impact on an energy company's financial condition and results  
of operations. The prices of energy fuels can be materially impacted by general 
economic conditions, demand for energy fuels, industry inventory levels,        
production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), weather-related disruptions and damage,   
competing fuel prices, and geopolitical risks. Recently, the price of crude     
oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels has declined substantially and          
experienced significant volatility, which has adversely impacted energy         
companies and their stock prices and dividends. The price of energy fuels may   
decline further and have further adverse effects on energy companies.           

  Some energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional
energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves significant      
operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no assurance    
that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically      
recoverable.                                                                    

 The energy industry also faces substantial government regulation, including
environmental regulation regarding air emissions and disposal of hazardous      
materials. These regulations may increase costs and limit production and usage  
of certain fuels. Additionally, governments have been increasing their          
attention to issues related to greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and climate     
change, and regulatory measures to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently  
in various stages of discussion or implementation. GHG emissions-related        
regulations could substantially harm energy companies, including by reducing    
the demand for energy fuels and increasing compliance costs. Energy companies   
also face risks related to political conditions in oil producing regions (such  
as the Middle East). Political instability or war in these regions could        
negatively impact energy companies.                                             

The operations of energy companies can be disrupted by natural or human   
factors beyond the control of the energy company. These include hurricanes,     
floods, severe storms, and other weather events, civil unrest, accidents, war,  
earthquakes, fire, political events, systems failures, and terrorist attacks,   
any of which could result in suspension of operations. Energy companies also    
face certain hazards inherent to operating in their industry, such as           
accidental releases of energy fuels or other hazardous materials, explosions,   
and mechanical failures, which can result in environmental damage, loss of      
life, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption of operations.        

Utility Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by    
utility companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries.  
Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and other energy related    
utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties, including:             

o    Risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    Restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    Regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    Coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    Technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    The effects of unusual, unexpected or abnormal local weather     

 o    Maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to
regulatory and other factors;                               

o    The potential impact of natural or manmade disasters;            

 o    Difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    The high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    Difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities;                                          

o    Increased competition; and                                       

o    International politics.                                          

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water,   
or the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could       
adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the bonds and the          
performance of the Trust.                                                       

Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level
in the United States, and many are regulated at the state level as well. The    
value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation     
affecting the utilities industry can change. This regulation may prevent or     
delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers,   
which could hinder the utility company's ability to meet its obligations to its 
suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, including the acceleration  
of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, by its 
creditors against such utility company. Furthermore, regulatory authorities,    
which may be subject to political and other pressures, may not grant future     
rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational policies, any of which  
could adversely affect a company's profitability and its stock price.           

Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial 
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been         
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic       
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit 
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates   
of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business 
and may be less profitable. While regulated providers tend to have regulated    
returns, non-regulated providers' returns are not regulated and generally are   
more volatile. These developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those 
states with non-regulated providers and could impact the short-term earnings    
potential of some in this industry. These trends have also made shares of some  
utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to 
changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their    
earnings they pay out as dividends.                                             

Certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of   
nuclear facilities for electric generation, including, among other              
considerations, litigation, the problems associated with the use of radioactive 
materials and the effects of natural or man-made disasters. In general, certain 
utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their 
power plant operations, increased costs from new or greater regulation of these 
operations, and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control           
equipment.                                                                      

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" and notes 
thereto. This information relates to other characteristics of the bonds. This   
section briefly describes some of these characteristics.                        

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond       
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.  

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type   
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's    
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during 
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

  "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,  
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be        
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or 
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to    
the First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts        
necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become          
available from interest payments on the related bonds. Also, since interest on  
any "when, as and if issued" bonds does not begin accruing to the benefit of    
Unitholders until the date of delivery, the Trustee may reduce its fee and pay  
Trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same estimated net annual   
interest income during the first year of the Trust's operations as described    
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information".                             

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   
or any other government agency.                                                 

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term Return as of the 
Date of Deposit are set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". Estimated Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated  
net annual interest income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated 
net annual interest income per Unit will vary with changes in the interest      
rates applicable to the bonds (some of which may be subject to adjustments      
related to changes in the bonds' ratings as provided by certain ratings         
services), fees and expenses of your Trust and with the principal prepayment,   
default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. The Public   
Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds. Accordingly,   
there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return will be         
realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a        
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that    
the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The      
Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ  
because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated    
date and amount of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return        
calculation includes only net annual interest income and Public Offering        
Price.                                                                          

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account (including cash to pay organization costs) and accrued        
interest, if any. The maximum sales charge for a High Yield Trust is equal to   
2.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit (3.04% of the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds). Organization costs are not included in the Public Offering 
Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge. After the initial  
public offering period, the secondary market Public Offering Price is based on  
the bid prices of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in 
the Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The actual sales charge     
that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges      
shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the Public       
Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased. The minimum purchase in    
the primary and secondary market is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling 
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.           

The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the 
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR  
Life") of your Trust's portfolio:                                               

ELTR Life (Years)   Sales Charge

Less than 2             1.50%                                                   
2 but less than 4       2.00

15 and over             4.80                                                    

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering     
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a    
Trust with an ELTR Life of "6 but less than 8" years would be 3.50% of the      
Public Offering Price per Unit (3.630% of the aggregate bid price of the        
bonds).                                                                         

Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for  
a reduced sales charge. As further described in this section, purchases         
executed on the same day by a single person at the same broker-dealer may be    
combined for sales charge discount calculation purposes. Secondary market       
purchases are excluded for purposes of sales charge discount calculations.      

Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. Based upon the aggregate dollar amount of Units        
purchased by a Unitholder in the initial offering period, the following table   
shows both the corresponding sales charge and the concession or agency          
commission allowed to broker-dealers and other selling agents on such           
transaction.

$500,000 - $999,999           2.20             1.50                             
$1,000,000 - $2,999,999       1.95             1.30                             
$3,000,000 - $4,999,999       1.70             1.10

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to   
purchases of a single Trust made by the same person on a single day from a      
single broker-dealer. Additional information regarding the broker-dealer        
concession or agency commission is presented in the "Unit Distribution"         
section.                                                                        

Aggregated Purchases-- For purposes of achieving these levels, you may    
combine certain purchases made on the same day through a single broker-dealer   
or selling agent, as further described below. You must inform your              
broker-dealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for 
a reduced sales charge. For purposes of achieving the quantity discount levels  
in the above table, Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus may be combined 
with (i) purchases of units of any other Invesco-sponsored unit investment      
trusts during each trust's initial offering period, (ii) purchases of units     
made as described under the "Fee Accounts" paragraph in this section, and (iii) 
purchases of units eligible for the sales charge discounts described under the  
"Exchanges" paragraph in this section. In addition, Units purchased in the name 
of your spouse (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) or children    
(including step-children) under 21 living in the same household as you will be  
deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the    
applicable quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also   
be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single     
trust, estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or      
fiduciary account.                                                              

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to    
the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer   
to the section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these        
purchases. Units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the Public  
Offering Price less the maximum applicable concession the Sponsor typically     
allows to brokers and dealers (either non-Underwriter or Underwriter            
concession, whichever is greater) for purchases by investors who purchase Units 
through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and        
registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for      
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management 
services, or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an   
investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is  
imposed ("Fee Accounts") if the Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the   
Trust is subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). For     
example, with respect to a High Yield Trust, Wrap Fee Eligible purchasers would 
pay a sales charge of only 0.60%, which represents the maximum sales charge     
minus the maximum applicable concession of 2.35%. The Sponsor reserves the      
right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in this paragraph by        
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be  
detrimental to a Trust. As described above in "Large Quantity Purchases", Units 
purchased for a Fee Account may be combined with certain other purchases for    
purposes of achieving the quantity discount levels presented in the table above 
under "Large Quantity Purchases", however, such Wrap Fee Eligible Units are not 
eligible for any sales charge discounts in addition to that which is described  
in this paragraph and under the "Fee Accounts" section found below.             

Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit    
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from     
such trusts to purchase Units of a High Yield Trust, or units of any other      
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust in its initial offering period, at a    
reduced sales charge. For such purchases of less than $3,000,000, the sales     
charge will be reduced by 1.00% for Units of a High Yield Trust. For purchases  
of $3,000,000 or more, either made solely with redemption or termination        
proceeds from other unit investment trusts or in combination with other         
purchases as described above under "Large Quantity Purchases", High Yield Trust 
Units will be eligible for the applicable quantity discount level presented in  
the table that appears in that subsection. For aggregated purchases described   
above in the "Large Quantity Purchases" subsection that consist of any units    
other than High Yield Trust Units, please refer to the prospectus of the        
applicable Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust for information regarding    
the specified sales charge reductions on those units. In order to be eligible   
for the sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases made with           
redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts, the trade 
date of each rollover or redemption, or each other trust's termination date     
resulting in the receipt of such proceeds used to purchase Units of the Trust   
must all be derived from transactions that occurred within 30 calendar days     
prior to your Unit purchase. In addition, the discounts will only be available  
for investors that utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer 
with appropriate notification) for both the Unit purchase and the transaction   
resulting in the receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds used for the 
Unit purchase. You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or      
other information to your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these  
reduced sales charge discounts. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on   
the redemption or termination of an interest in a Trust.                        

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses (or 
the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or step-children     
under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents and trustees,    
custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons (collectively         
referred to herein as "related purchasers")) of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.   
and its affiliates and, when permitted, Underwriters and their affiliates may   
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable underwriting    
commission or less the applicable dealer concession in the absence of an        
underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors (including related   
purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public    
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts    
are subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only employees,        
officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate   
in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.               

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in accordance with    
fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units as of the opening   
of business on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable      
sales charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering price of the      
bonds and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. This price       
determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by   
the Evaluator. During the initial offering period, the Evaluator will value the 
bonds as of the Evaluation Time on days the New York Stock Exchange is open for 
business and will adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. The    
"Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on     
each day that the Exchange is open for regular trading, or earlier on days      
where the Bond Market Association recommends an early bond market close,        
provided, however, on the Date of Deposit the Evaluation Time will be the close 
of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration  
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") becomes 
effective, if later. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will   
be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary  
market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding.    
For secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator   
as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for        
redemption and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to     
range approximately from 0.125% to 1.50% more than the bid price. The Public    
Offering Price per Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the  
Evaluation Time on each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to   
the Evaluation Time and orders received by authorized financial professionals   
prior to the Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by    
the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt.    
Orders received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received   
by authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders       
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after    
the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next    
determined Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by  
the Sponsor on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial      
professionals to transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will   
be received in a timely manner.                                                 

The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the        
appropriate bid prices or offering prices, as described herein, (a) on the      
basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily 
deal in bonds comparable to those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are   
not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c)  
by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the     
practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any   
combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate   
with changes in market interest rates.                                          

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

Organization Costs. During the initial offering period, part of the Public
Offering Price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated      
costs incurred in establishing your Trust. These costs include the costs of     
preparing documents relating to the Trust (such as the registration statement,  
prospectus, trust agreement and legal documents), federal and state             
registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and the initial 
audit. Your Trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial   
offering period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will   
decline when the Trust deducts these costs from the Trust assets.               

 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although your    
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount  
of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with  
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate    
share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public         
Offering Price of Units. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid   
on your Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued 
interest which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance   
the amount of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of 
the First Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the      
Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the      
First Settlement Date to the date of settlement, less any distributions from    
the Interest Account after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying    
interest payment dates of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will 
be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your Trust and      
distributed to Unitholders. If you sell or redeem all or a portion of your      
Units, you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued  
interest from the purchaser of your Units.                                      

Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states.            

High Yield Trust Concessions. During the initial offering period, the     
Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units of High Yield Trusts to                
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the applicable gross concession or      
agency commission set forth in the "Broker-Dealer Concession or Agency          
Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales Charge -- Large
Quantity Purchases". These breakpoints will be adjusted to take into            
consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely      
fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be issued.               

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a High Yield Trust, the regular concession or agency commission        
allowed by the Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will amount   
to 1.30% for aggregated purchases of less than $3,000,000. For such aggregated  
purchases of $3,000,000 or more, the regular concession or agency commission    
will correspond to the amounts listed in the "Broker-Dealer Concession or       
Agency Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales Charge --     
Large Quantity Purchases".                                                      

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the maximum concession allowed to Underwriters by   
the Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.    

  Following the end of the initial offering period, any broker-dealer or other
selling agent who is not a Qualifying Broker-Dealer (as described below) will   
be entitled to receive an additional per Unit concession based on the following 
table corresponding to the aggregate number of Trust Units purchased from the   
Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering period.                           

Aggregate Number of Units    Additional                                         
Purchased from the Sponsor   Concession                                         
---------------------------------------                                         
250 - 999 Units                 0.10%                                           
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units       0.20%                                           
3,000 Units or more             0.25%                                           

Notwithstanding the concession amounts presented in the "Broker-Dealer    
Concession or Agency Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales
Charge -- Large Quantity Purchases", broker-dealers and other selling agents    
who have not acted as Underwriters for the Trust that purchase 250 or more      
Units of a Trust from the Sponsor on the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying           
Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a concession or agency commission on all Units 
of a Trust purchased from the Sponsor throughout the initial offering period    
equal to the regular concession allowed to Underwriters described under         
"Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below. Further, Qualifying               
Broker-Dealers not receiving the maximum concession amount per Unit on the Date 
of Deposit may be eligible to receive an additional per Unit concession based   
upon the aggregate number of Trust Units purchased from the Sponsor as of the   
end of the initial offering period. Qualifying Broker Dealers having purchased  
less than 1,000 Units of the Trust from the Sponsor on the Date of Deposit will 
be entitled to an additional concession of 0.10% if the aggregate number of     
Trust Units purchased from the Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering    
period totals at least 1,000 Units but less than 3,000 Units, or an additional  
concession of 0.15% for totals of at least 3,000 Units. Qualifying Broker       
Dealers having purchased at least 1,000 Units but less than 3,000 Units of the  
Trust from the Sponsor on the Date of Deposit will be entitled to an additional 
concession of 0.05% if the aggregate number of Trust Units purchased from the   
Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering period totals at least 3,000      
Units.                                                                          

Regarding the additional per Unit concessions described above for both    
Qualifying Broker Dealers and for other broker-dealers or selling agents, these 
additional concessions will also be applied on a dollar basis utilizing an      
equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on whichever basis is more    
favorable to the dealer firm or selling agent. Purchase orders stated in        
dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only   
whole Units be issued will be subject to the concession amount corresponding to 
the dollar amount of the purchase order, utilizing a $1,000 per Unit            
equivalent.                                                                     

Concessions Based Upon Annual Sales. As described below, broker-dealers and
other selling agents may in certain cases be eligible for additional            
concessions based upon their annual eligible sales of all Invesco fixed income  
and equity unit investment trusts. Eligible sales include all units of any      
Invesco unit investment trust underwritten or purchased directly from Invesco   
during a trust's initial offering period. For purposes of the Volume Concession 
described below, trusts designated as either "Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable      
Income Series" or "Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series" are fixed income      
trusts, and trusts designated as "Invesco Unit Trusts Series" are equity trusts.

Volume Concession-- In addition to the concessions or agency commissions  
described above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms (including          
Underwriters) will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on      
total initial offering period sales of all eligible Invesco unit investment     
trusts during the previous consecutive 12-month period through the end of the   
most recent month. The Volume Concession, as applicable to equity and fixed     
income trust units, is set forth in the following table:

Broker-dealers and other selling firms will not receive the Volume        
Concession on the sale of units purchased in Fee Accounts, however, such sales  
will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level          
breakpoints set forth in the Volume Concession table above. Secondary market    
sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for purposes of the Volume     
Concession. Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing     
firms that place orders with Invesco and provide Invesco with information with  
respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible dealer 
firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely provide       
clearing services to other broker-dealer firms or firms who place orders        
through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We reserve the right to       
change the amount of the concessions or agency commissions from time to time.   
For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation, the trust's        
prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional compensation.     

Additional Volume Concession Eligibility-- Underwriters, broker-dealers or
other selling firms having achieved $500 million in total eligible sales for    
the previous 12 month period through the end of the most recent month are       
eligible to receive an additional volume concession for each Trust Unit         
underwritten or purchased directly from the Sponsor on the initial Date of      
Deposit equal to the difference between the maximum allowable concession        
described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" and the per Unit         
concession applicable to each Trust Unit underwritten or purchased. Only Units  
acquired on the Date of Deposit may qualify for this additional per Unit volume 
concession, and Unit acquisitions made on subsequent days will be subject to    
the applicable levels as stated in the "Unit Distribution" and "Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" sections. This additional per Unit volume concession  
will be payable either at the time the Units are acquired or following the end  
of the initial offering period, at the election of the recipient. With respect  
to any Units for which an Underwriter, broker-dealer or other selling firm      
receives this additional per Unit volume concession, such Units will not be     
eligible for additional per Unit concessions described under "High Yield Trust
Concessions."

Additional Information. Certain commercial banks may be making Units      
available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge  
paid by these customers (equal to the agency commission referred to above) is   
retained by or remitted to the banks. Any discount provided to investors will   
be borne by the selling dealer or agent. For secondary market transactions, the 
Sponsor will sell Units to broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public      
Offering Price less a concession or agency commission of 80% of the applicable  
sales charge. Dealers other than the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary    
market to other broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
less a concession or agency commission not in excess of the secondary market    
concession allowed to the dealer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary      
herein, in no case shall the total of any concessions, agency commissions and   
any additional compensation allowed or paid to any broker, dealer or other      
distributor of Units with respect to any individual transaction exceed the      
maximum sales charge applicable to High Yield Trusts. The Sponsor reserves the  
right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and   
to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and      
others from time to time.                                                       

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will sell Units to      
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession described in the sections below. For a list of the Underwriters that 
have purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting".                      

The Sponsor will sell Units of High Yield Trusts to Underwriters at the   
regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession per Unit             
underwritten set forth in the following table.

--------------------------------------                                          
250 - 999 Units               2.20%                                             
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units     2.30%

 An Underwriter will be allowed a concession throughout the initial offering
period of a Trust equal to the Underwriter concession allowed to such firm on   
the Date of Deposit for Units subsequently purchased from the Sponsor. At the   
end of the initial offering period, an Underwriter not receiving the maximum    
concession amount per Unit on the Date of Deposit may be eligible to receive an 
additional per Unit concession based upon the aggregate number of Trust Units   
underwritten and subsequently purchased from the Sponsor as of the end of the   
initial offering period. Underwriters having underwritten less than 1,000 Units 
of the Trust will be entitled to an additional concession of 0.10% if the       
aggregate number of Trust Units underwritten and subsequently purchased from    
the Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering period totals at least 1,000  
Units but less than 3,000 Units, or an additional concession of 0.15% for       
totals of at least 3,000 Units. Underwriters having underwritten at least 1,000 
Units but less than 3,000 Units of the Trust will be entitled to an additional  
concession of 0.05% if the aggregate number of Trust Units underwritten and     
subsequently purchased from the Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering   
period totals at least 3,000 Units.                                             

The concessions for a) Units underwritten on the Date of Deposit, b) Units
purchased from the Sponsor by an Underwriter subsequent to the Date of Deposit  
during a Trust's initial offering period, and c) the additional per Unit        
concession for Underwriters will each also be applied on a dollar basis         
utilizing an equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on whichever     
basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. Purchase orders stated in dollars   
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued will be subject to the concession amount corresponding to the   
stated dollar amount of the purchase order, utilizing a $1,000 per Unit         
equivalent.                                                                     

 Any Underwriter which has achieved $500 million in total eligible sales for
the previous 12 month period through the end of the most recent month will be   
eligible to receive an additional per Unit volume concession as described under 
"Unit Distribution--Concessions Based Upon Annual Sales--Additional Volume      
Concession Eligibility".                                                        

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter          
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, in certain      
instances, the sum of the sales charge discount and the broker-dealer           
concession may exceed the concession allowed to the Underwriter. At the request 
of the Underwriter, the Sponsor may repurchase such Units at the Public         
Offering Price per Unit less the concession amount allowed to the Underwriter   
during the Trust's initial offering period, and subsequently resell those Units 
back to the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price per Unit less the          
applicable sales charge reduction per Unit and broker-dealer concession amounts 
listed in the table found under "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales
Charge--Large Quantity Purchases".                                              

In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio". The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also realize profits or losses 
with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from underwriting      
syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not participated as sole 
underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from    
which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may further realize profit or loss  
during the initial offering period as a result of possible fluctuations in the  
market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units  
(excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will be    
retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of an Underwriter are entitled to the  
same dealer concessions or agency commissions that are available to the         
Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits Underwriters may realize from    
the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share with certain Underwriters a portion   
of any gain represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the  
Sponsor and the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit (less deductions 
for accrued interest and certain costs). For Underwriters who either (a)        
underwrite at least 3,000 Units or (b) submit an Underwriter purchase order of  
at least $3,000,000, the Sponsor will share 50% of that portion of the gain     
that relates to the Units actually underwritten by such Underwriters. For those 
Underwriters who either (a) underwrite at least 1,000 Units but less than 3,000 
Units or (b) submit an Underwriter purchase order of at least $1,000,000 but    
less than $3,000,000, the Sponsor will share 25% of that portion of the gain    
that relates to the Units actually underwritten by such Underwriters. The       
Sponsor and certain of the other Underwriters will also realize profits or      
losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are     
purchased and the price at which Units are resold in connection with            
maintaining a secondary market for Units and will also realize profits or       
losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or     
below the purchase price.                                                       

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trust and our 
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and      
offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon    
the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal   
cash on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges 
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A           
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as   
to current market prices in order to determine whether there is any price in    
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will 
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid  
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per 
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would 
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Trust is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your          
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these          
accounts. For these purchases you generally only pay the portion of the sales   
charge that is retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.  
You should consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section    
for specific information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section 
governs the calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the 
right to limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or       
selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental   
to a Trust.                                                                     

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly. The amount and time of   
the first distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". In addition, a Trust that has elected to be structured as a       
"regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes may make additional     
required distributions at the end of each year.                                 

Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,        
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the       
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be 
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the        
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The 
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or       
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits   
from the use of these funds). Should the amount available for distribution in   
the Principal Account equal or exceed $5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a   
distribution from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date   
to Unitholders of record on the related monthly record date. However, funds in  
the Principal Account will be distributed on the last distribution date of each 
calendar year to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date if the   
amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.          

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year and the interest rates on certain bonds in the Trust may    
adjust periodically, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on    
the second distribution date after the purchase.                                

Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust   
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day  
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the   
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental     
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem 
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank 
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three         
business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an     
amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after 
receipt by the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed   
to be the date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as       
regards Units received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange  
is open and the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on    
that day for redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received   
by authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are     
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the        
Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by          
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption      
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until 
after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the   
next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the       
Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial          
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee   
so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling  
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests.      
Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.       

Under Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regulations, the Trustee is    
required to withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee 
has not received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such 
regulations or if the IRS notifies the Trustee that such withholding is         
required. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by 
the Unitholder only when filing a return or a claim for refund. Under normal    
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "backup withholding".            

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds   
as of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on  
the date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the           
Redemption Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The        
Redemption Price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of    
(i) the cash on hand in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected,    
(ii) the value of the bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, (iii) accrued 
interest, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and 
(b) the accrued Trust expenses. During the initial offering period, the         
Redemption Price and secondary market repurchase price are not reduced by       
estimated organization costs. The Evaluator may determine the value of the      
bonds by employing any of the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Unit
Price". Accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the         
Interest Account or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal 
Account. All other amounts will be withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units  
so redeemed shall be cancelled.                                                 

The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented   
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When    
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may 
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result   
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                               

The Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of 1,000 or more 
Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in an in kind    
distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution of bonds will be made by the     
Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in           
book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository  
Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be       
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a             
Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in kind 
distribution.                                                                   

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any    
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full   
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.        

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust   
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco   
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. An exchange does not avoid a taxable     
disposition of your redeemed Units. You should contact your financial           
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax          
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will     
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal and state  
income tax purposes.                                                            

 Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or      
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account   
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units    
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you     
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by  
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in 
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.            

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be      
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the    
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within 
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will        
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a       
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual   
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust        
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the   
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account 
or your Trust, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The        
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.                 

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The  
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco        
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco  
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide      
range of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and    
high net worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is      
located at 11 Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of June 30, 2016,   
the total stockholders' equity of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. was             
$105,041,393.09 (unaudited). The current assets under management and            
supervision by Invesco Ltd. and its affiliates were valued at approximately     
$779.6 billion as of June 30, 2016.                                             

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report 
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential 
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with        
respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional           
information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot perform our duties under 
the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may appoint a new sponsor,  
continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or terminate your Trust and   
distribute the liquidation proceeds.                                            

Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company      
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have questions       
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its         
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The 
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New 
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of  
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal        
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding    
the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's 
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger        
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the       
Trustee. See "Additional Information".                                          

Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds   
or other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of      
certain legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated   
by the Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The   
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description   
of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria    
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also         
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust       
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and   
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not   
be reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been      
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under    
the Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract    
and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the       
amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement  
Bonds must (i) be bonds, debentures, notes or other straight debt obligations   
(whether secured or unsecured and whether senior or subordinated) without       
equity or other conversion features, with fixed maturity dates substantially    
the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no warrants or subscription        
privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States currency; (iii) not be    
when, as and if issued obligations or restricted securities; and (iv) be issued 
or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt from the reporting requirements 
under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar    
provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by means of a lease   
agreement, agreement to buy securities, services or products, or other similar  
commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the payment of the substitute     
bonds. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust within five days     
after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata           
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed Bond        
exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed      
Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable   
to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and distribute the principal  
and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of     
removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 calendar     
days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated Net Annual  
Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current Return and  
Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be able to     
reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of 
the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                                  

Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the   
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially     
adversely affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith   
by the Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to      
increase the number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition  
to or in substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust,      
except for the substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify 
Unitholders of any amendment.                                                   

 Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the       
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet     
sold are tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the   
Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the   
time they were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder  
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower       
amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that    
time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon   
termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at 
the time of purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share  
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs, 
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust           
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own    
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of   
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless  
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee   
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under    
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for 
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is  
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations   
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best         
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be     
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in         
judgment.                                                                       

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust as of the date of this prospectus. Tax  
laws and interpretations are subject to change, and this summary does not       
describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, except as   
specifically provided below, this summary generally does not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt entity, financial institution, person who marks to market their      
Units or other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section   
does not describe your alternative minimum, state, local or foreign tax         
consequences. Depending on the terms of certain bond issuances, however, some   
of the bonds in the Trust may be exempt from state and local taxes of the state 
in which such bonds were issued. Please consult with your tax advisor with      
respect to any specific state or local tax consequences of an investment in the 
Trust.                                                                          

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The IRS could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this      
section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income    
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. Additional            
information on taxes is contained in the Information Supplement.                

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. The Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a     
"regulated investment company" under the federal tax laws. If the Trust         
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as       
provided in the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income        
taxes.                                                                          

Distributions. Trust distributions are generally taxable to you. After the
end of each year, you will receive a tax statement that specifies your amount   
of ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends.                   

  Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital      
gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In addition, the Trust 
may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and  
thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions 
from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in   
additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you  
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by        
amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require   
you to treat certain distributions made to you in January as if you had         
received them on December 31 of the previous year.                              

A distribution paid by your Trust reduces the Trust's net asset value per 
Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly, a         
distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would be    
subject to income tax even though it may be viewed, in substance, as a partial  
return of capital.                                                              

Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation 
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received        
deduction with respect to dividends received from the Trust because the         
dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from  
regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock. An individual that  
owns Units generally will not be entitled to treat Trust distributions as       
qualified dividend income currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates, as  
it is not expected that Trust distributions will be attributable to qualified   
dividend income received by the Trust.                                          

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this     
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the  
amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is  
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.   
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you         
purchase your Units.                                                            

  Capital Gains and Losses. Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain
minus net short term capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is 
long term if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is      
short-term if the holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must    
exclude the date you purchase your Units to determine your holding period.      
However, if you receive a capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your   
Unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be        
recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain     
dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held    
for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income.             

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes. In general, any 
gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated   
as capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be       
disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced within a period of 
61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of    
Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or     
enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or   
securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to 
reflect the disallowed loss.                                                    

In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. In general, this distribution will be treated as a sale for  
federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss, based on the   
value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received, and       
subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax     
rules.                                                                          

Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by your   
Trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases,    
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these Trust expenses as   
income. In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.  
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment          
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these   
deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Such deductions 
may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain         
levels.                                                                         

Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other 
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax          
treaties, distributions from the Trust will be characterized as dividends for   
federal income tax purposes (other than dividends that the Trust reports as     
capital gain dividends) and will generally be subject to U.S. income taxes,     
including withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions. However             
distributions received by a foreign investor from the Trust that are properly   
reported by the Trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust      
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met. Distributions     
received by a foreign investor attributable to interest-related dividends of a  
regulated investment company such as the Trust may not be subject to U.S.       
federal income tax withholding. The amount of distributions that may be         
reported as interest-related dividends will be limited to the amount of         
qualified net interest income, which is generally the Trust's U.S.-source       
interest income less allocable expenses.                                        

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross 
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid  
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial   
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due  
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the   
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain  
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under   
FATCA. If required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of    
any intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant     
foreign country, withholding under FATCA is applies: (i) with respect to        
distributions from your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains    
distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur 
on or after January 1, 2019. If withholding is required under FATCA on a        
payment related to your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to 
withholding (or that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of           
withholding) on such payment generally will be required to seek a refund or     
credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your  
Trust will not pay any additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under  
FATCA. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based  
on your individual circumstances.                                               

Backup Withholding. By law, your Trust must withhold as backup withholding a
percentage (currently 28%) of your taxable distributions and redemption         
proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer         
identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup            
withholding, or if the IRS instructs your Trust to do so.                       

Investors Should Consult Their Tax Advisors. Investors in the Trust may be
subject to federal, state, local, or foreign taxes in connection with their     
investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax      
advisors regarding the specific federal, state, local, and foreign tax          
consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment in the Trust.    

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts, provided that organization 
costs are generally paid out of cash deposited in the Principal Account. The    
Trustee also may withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems 
necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of    
the Trusts. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's    
assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such      
amounts to the appropriate Accounts.                                            

  Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the           
establishment of your Trust. These costs and charges will include the cost of   
the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration    
statement and other documents relating to your Trust, federal and state         
registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, and  
legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering Price of Units includes the    
estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from    
your Trust's assets at the end of the initial offering period or after six      
months, if earlier.                                                             

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" for providing bookkeeping    
and administrative services and for providing portfolio supervisory services    
for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these       
services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing these services 
to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total cost of         
providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive the     
annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its services the        
Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" (which may be reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's 
compensation for its services is expected to result from the use of the funds   
being held in the Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions,     
payment of expenses and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest       
bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on the outstanding principal       
amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of   
the close of business on January 1 for each year thereafter. The Sponsor's,     
Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval  
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the   
category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for All    
Urban Consumers or, if this category is not published, in a comparable          
category.                                                                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts        
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any        
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds  
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon            
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for   
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may  
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest     
rates). Each Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration 
statement each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of  
the Trusts. When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee,    
they are secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the     
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for 
amounts payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such 
amounts.                                                                        

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the      
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This 
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of 
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.    

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to  
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as  
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.                       

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current         
information furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from      
other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an      
audit in connection with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on        
unaudited financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or    
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or 
based on other circumstances.                                                   

 The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:                                                

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

  III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
          the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As  
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in  
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or   
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

  AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in         
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

BB--An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other  
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure   
to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the  
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the           
obligation.                                                                     

  B--An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations
rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial    
commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic          
conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its 
financial commitment on the obligation.                                         

  CCC--An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the   
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of     
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely  
to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.        

CC--An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.

C--A 'C' rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly      
vulnerable to nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by   
the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of  
a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment    
default. Among others, the 'C' rating may be assigned to subordinated debt,     
preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended 
in accordance with the instrument's terms or when preferred stock is the        
subject of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is     
either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments       
having a total value that is less than par.                                     

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is       
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's    
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

  Moody's Investors Service. General long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term
obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income     
obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the     
possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such   
ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered  
in the event of default.                                                        

   Aaa--Obligations rated 'Aaa' are judged to be of the highest quality, subject
to the lowest level of credit risk.                                             

 Aa--Obligations rated 'Aa' are judged to be of high quality and are subject
to very low credit risk.                                                        

   A--Obligations rated 'A' are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to
low credit risk.                                                                

Baa--Obligations rated 'Baa' are judged to be medium-grade and subject to 
moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative                
characteristics.                                                                

Ba--Obligations rated 'Ba' are judged to be speculative and are subject to
substantial credit risk.                                                        

 B--Obligations rated 'B' are considered speculative and are subject to high
credit risk.                                                                    

Caa--Obligations rated 'Caa' are judged to be speculative of poor standing
and are subject to very high credit risk.                                       

  Ca--Obligations rated 'Ca' are highly speculative and are likely in, or very
near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.        

C--Obligations rated 'C' are the lowest rated class of bonds and are      
typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or         
interest.                                                                       

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

  Fitch Ratings. Long-Term Ratings Scales. Fitch rated entities in a number of
sectors, including financial and non-financial corporations, sovereigns and     
insurance companies, are generally assigned Issuer Default Ratings ("IDRs").    
IDRs opine on an entity's relative vulnerability to default on financial        
obligations. The "threshold" default risk addressed by the IDR is generally     
that of the financial obligations whose non-payment would best reflect the      
uncured failure of that entity. As such, IDRs also address relative             
vulnerability to bankruptcy, administrative receivership or similar concepts,   
although the agency recognizes that issuers may also make preemptive and        
therefore voluntary use of such mechanisms.                                     

In aggregate, IDRs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on the     
agency's view of their relative vulnerability to default, rather than a         
prediction of a specific percentage likelihood of default. For historical       
information on the default experience of Fitch-rated issuers, please consult    
the transition and default performance studies available from the Fitch Ratings 
website.                                                                        

     o    The ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood
over any given time period;                                 

o    The ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer's     
      securities or stock, or the likelihood that this value may change;

   o    The ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer's securities
or stock;                                                   

o    The ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an     
obligation should an issuer default;                        

o    The ratings do not opine on the suitability of an issuer as a    
counterparty to trade credit;                               

o    The ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer's   
      business, operational or financial profile other than the agency's
opinion on its relative vulnerability to default;           

 AAA--Highest credit quality. 'AAA' ratings denote the lowest expectation of
default risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity  
for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be    
adversely affected by foreseeable events.                                       

AA--Very high credit quality. 'AA' ratings denote expectations of very low
default risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial       
commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable       
events.                                                                         

  A--High credit quality. 'A' ratings denote expectations of low default risk.
The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This    
capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic  
conditions than is the case for higher ratings.                                 

BBB--Good credit quality. 'BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of     
default risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial           
commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions  
are more likely to impair this capacity.                                        

 BB--Speculative. 'BB' ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default
risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic      
conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists which   
supports the servicing of financial commitments.                                

B--Highly speculative. 'B' ratings indicate that material default risk is 
present, but a limited margin of safety remains. Financial commitments are      
currently being met; however, capacity for continued payment is vulnerable to   
deterioration in the business and economic environment.                         

CCC--Substantial credit risk. Default is a real possibility.              

 CC--Very high levels of credit risk. Default of some kind appears probable.

C--Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. Default is imminent or       
inevitable, or the issuer is in standstill. Conditions that are indicative of a 
'C' category rating for an issuer include:                                      

a.   the issuer has entered into a grace or cure period following     
non-payment of a material financial obligation;             

b.   the issuer has entered into a temporary negotiated waiver or     
  standstill agreement following a payment default on a material
financial obligation; or                                    

c.   Fitch Ratings otherwise believes a condition of 'RD' or 'D' to be
          imminent or inevitable, including through the formal announcement of a
coercive debt exchange.                                     

Note: The modifiers "+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to denote relative   
status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the 'AAA' 
Long-Term IDR category, or to Long-Term IDR categories below 'B'.

Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor    
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect   
in any of the bonds.                                                            

  High-Yield Bonds. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the risks that an investment in "high-yield, high-risk" debt   
obligations or "junk" obligations may entail, including increased credit risks  
and the risk that the value of the Units will decline, and may decline          
precipitously, with increases in interest rates. The bonds included in the      
Trust may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income  
and principal than are investments in lower-yielding, higher-rated bonds, and   
their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates,   
not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values, but also     
because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease   
in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of        
issuers of high-yield, high-risk bonds resulting in a higher incidence of       
defaults among high-yield, high-risk bonds. A slowdown in the economy, or a     
development adversely affecting an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the 
issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at the  
prices, respectively, that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to meet 
its interest and principal requirements. For an issuer that has outstanding     
both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated high-yield, high-risk bonds,  
an increase in interest rates will increase that issuer's interest expense      
insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating. However, many     
leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap  
the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt. This reduces exposure  
to increasing rates, but reduces the benefit to the issuer of declining rates.  
The Sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their consequences or,   
therefore, the course or extent of any similar market fluctuations in the       
future.                                                                         

"High-yield" or "junk" bonds, the generic names for bonds rated below BBB-
by Standard & Poor's, or below Baa3 by Moody's, are frequently issued by        
corporations in the growth stage of their development, by established companies 
whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies   
purchased in leveraged buyout transactions. The market for high-yield bonds is  
very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly financial          
institutions. High-yield bonds are generally not listed on a national           
securities exchange. Trading of high-yield bonds, therefore, takes place        
primarily in over-the-counter markets that consist of groups of dealer firms    
that are typically major securities firms. Because the high-yield bond market   
is a dealer market, rather than an auction market, no single obtainable price   
for a given bond prevails at any given time. Prices are determined by           
negotiation between traders. The existence of a liquid trading market for the   
bonds may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the bonds. There can  
be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the bonds, that any       
market for the bonds will be maintained or of the liquidity of the bonds in any 
markets made. Not all dealers maintain markets in all high-yield bonds.         
Therefore, since there are fewer traders in these bonds than there are in       
"investment grade" bonds, the bid-offer spread is usually greater for           
high-yield bonds than it is for investment grade bonds. The price at which the  
bonds may be sold and the value of the Trust will be adversely affected if      
trading markets for the bonds are limited or absent. If the rate of redemptions 
is great, the value of the Trust may decline to a level that requires           
liquidation.                                                                    

Lower-rated bonds tend to offer higher yields than higher-rated bonds with
the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers of lower-rated  
bonds may not be as strong as that of other issuers. Moreover, if a bond is     
recharacterized as equity by the Internal Revenue Service for federal income    
tax purposes, the issuer's interest deduction with respect to the bond will be  
disallowed and this disallowance may adversely affect the issuer's credit       
rating. Because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks       
associated with the lower-rated bonds in the Trust, the yields and prices of    
these bonds tend to fluctuate more than higher-rated bonds with changes in the  
perceived quality of the credit of their issuers. In addition, the market value 
of high-yield, high-risk bonds may fluctuate more than the market value of      
higher-rated bonds since these bonds tend to reflect short-term credit          
development to a greater extent than higher-rated bonds. Lower-rated bonds      
generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than            
higher-rated bonds. Issuers of lower-rated bonds may possess fewer              
creditworthiness characteristics than issuers of higher-rated bonds and,        
especially in the case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have     
recently been downgraded, may be subject to claims by debtholders, owners of    
property leased to the issuer or others which, if sustained, would make it more 
difficult for the issuers to meet their payment obligations. High-yield,        
high-risk bonds are also affected by variables such as interest rates,          
inflation rates and real growth in the economy. Therefore, investors should     
consider carefully the relative risks associated with investment in bonds that  
carry lower ratings.                                                            

High-yield, high-risk bonds are generally subordinated obligations. The   
payment of principal (and premium, if any), interest and sinking fund           
requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is           
subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the    
issuer. Senior obligations generally include most, if not all, significant debt 
obligations of an issuer, whether existing at the time of issuance of           
subordinated debt or created thereafter. Upon any distribution of the assets of 
an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution, total or partial      
liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer,  
the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full  
before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any     
payment. Moreover, generally no payment with respect to subordinated            
indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any       
senior indebtedness. Thus, in the event of insolvency, holders of senior        
indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more, ratably, than holders of 
subordinated indebtedness of that issuer.                                       

  Obligations that are rated lower than "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's, or "Baa3"
by Moody's, respectively, should be considered speculative as such ratings      
indicate a quality of less than investment grade. Investors should carefully    
review the objective of the Trust and consider their ability to assume the      
risks involved before making an investment in the Trust.                        

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. The Trust may invest 
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell consumer    
products. The profitability of these companies will be affected by various      
factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending        
trends. In the past, there have been major changes in the retail environment    
due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved 
in the retail industry, particularly the department store segment. The          
continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industry's        
ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions, to  
attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in    
the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the   
consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment 
or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result 
in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence,        
adversely affecting consumer spending habits. Increasing employee and retiree   
benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors  
of the retail industry, competition may be fierce due to market saturation,     
converging consumer tastes and other factors. Because of these factors and the  
recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries, American retailers 
are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden         
weakening of foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to local conditions and  
constraints and added research costs.                                           

Financial Services Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds   
issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector.              

The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007 
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services  
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment    
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact   
of these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and   
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation 
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility   
of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles.     
Many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to   
finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity        
capital. In some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide    
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has 
nonetheless increased substantially.                                            

While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and      
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with 
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated     
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result 
of these steps.                                                                 

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio               
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real     
estate loans, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.    
Banks are highly dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is        
largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds, and can        
fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased          
competition. As initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a  
result of increasing interest rates and other factors, this income diminished.  
Economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated and have had a 
substantial negative effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of 
their assets invested in loans secured by real estate. Banks and their holding  
companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and, when such            
institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation as well. Such regulations 
impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of  
business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a  
wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement   
authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a        
particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of  
such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund.           
Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements       
applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be  
paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation          
("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay    
dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations,  
however, insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding        
companies, or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued   
by such institutions.                                                           

  The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone     
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are        
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;    
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the      
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been          
finalized and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects   
of the securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty.  
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial-services overhaul legislation allows       
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial      
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to           
investors. This legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and       
heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field.        
Legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent 
years, allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in   
any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into  
branches. Consolidation is likely to continue. The Securities and Exchange      
Commission (the "SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the 
expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules         
requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts  
or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in          
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated       
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and    
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory         
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act 
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as  
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the bonds in the Trust's 
portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is       
reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that       
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited  
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits   
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as          
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and          
increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and    
national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation      
allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited 
state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit.   
Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if     
any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what      
ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.               

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining        
Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with      
respect to any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of   
factors, including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction,   
the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting     
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of      
banks or bank holding companies.                                                

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view     
that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay     
cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in     
ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also 
may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its        
approval of certain applications, including applications for approval of        
mergers and acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any     
prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or        
whether such approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.                         

Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition 
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction 
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level  
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could       
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the prices of the          
securities, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including  
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive    
regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and        
changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws,   
regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies.                    

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the      
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in     
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather      
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual   
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come   
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have           
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state        
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company         
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")  
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,  
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws  
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal      
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the       
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation. 
The Sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will  
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance         
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.  

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"   
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount      
bond, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at       
higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to   
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market      
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.    

Portfolio Administration

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units      
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall  
quality of the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish.    
The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose   
of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                 

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution    
for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the       
Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take   
any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the 
issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of 
the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the   
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted          
therefor. Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement
Bonds" in the prospectus regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for    
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs 
and no provision for payment is made therefor within 30 days, the Trustee is    
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the    
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the  
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell  
the defaulted Bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby       
incurred.

Sponsor upon request.)                                                          

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report 
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential 
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with        
respect to your Trust.                                                          

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee Information 

 The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit        
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to 
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New  
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent          
permitted by law.                                                               

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.   
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all     
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such   
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any          
applicable state or federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is         
required to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement  
on file in its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during   
the usual business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the 
bonds held in the Trusts.                                                       

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee          
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed    
and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the         
retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the         
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a    
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or        
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each   
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such       
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds 
of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal 
of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor trustee accepts its      
appointment as such or when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a        
successor trustee. Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with   
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or   
consolidation to which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor       
trustee. The Trustee must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of  
the United States or any state and having at all times an aggregate capital,    
surplus and undivided profits of not less than $5,000,000.                      

Taxation

The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax   
issues concerning your Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
Trust Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion, is     
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion and is not intended to   
be a complete discussion of all material tax consequences that might apply to   
an investor in the Trust. Prospective investors should consult their own tax    
advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase,           
ownership, or disposition of Trust Units, as well as the tax consequences       
arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. country, or other       
taxing jurisdiction.                                                            

The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based on the
Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, case law and rulings and     
announcements by the Internal Revenue Service, and in part on the advice of     
counsel to your Trust. The laws on which such advice of counsel is based are    
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The Internal Revenue       
Service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In  
addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment  
of the assets to be held by your Trust.                                         

Your Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated        
investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the     
"Code") and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will 
not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its       
Unitholders. If the Trust does not qualify as a regulated investment company,   
it will be taxed as a regular corporation.                                      

To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally  
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Trust must, among other        
things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from   
dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from   
the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or     
other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,   
securities or currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded           
partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of 
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is 
represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government     
securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other    
securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for  
the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value  
of the Trust's total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting  
securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total 
assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or  
the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or   
two or more issuers which the Trust controls (by owning 20% or more of such     
issuer's outstanding voting securities) and which are engaged in the same,      
similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of qualified         
publicly traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment 
company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest  
and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but  
excludes net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt       
interest income, if any, each taxable year.                                     

 As a regulated investment company, your Trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders. Your      
Trust intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually,              
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital      
gain. If your Trust retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable  
income, it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate 
rates on the amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely  
basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject   
to a nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your Trust distributes      
during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its 
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital 
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those years. To    
prevent application of the excise tax, your Trust intends to make its           
distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement.    
Further, if your Trust retains any net capital gain, the Trust may designate    
the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders   
who, if subject to federal income tax on long-term capital gains, (i) will be   
required to include in income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term     
capital gain, their share of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be        
entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the Trust       
against their federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to   
the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. A distribution will be treated  
as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is declared by your   
Trust in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and   
paid by your Trust during January of the following calendar year. These         
distributions will be taxable to Unitholders in the calendar year in which the  
distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the          
distributions are received. There is no assurance that distributions made by    
your Trust will be sufficient to eliminate all taxes on the Trust for all       
periods. Your Trust may make taxable distributions to you even during periods   
in which the value of your Units has declined.                                  

 If your Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust      
would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such   
income were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of        
earnings and profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend         
income.                                                                         

 Your Trust may be required to withhold as backup withholding federal income
tax at the backup withholding rate on all taxable distributions payable to you  
if you fail to provide your correct taxpayer identification number or to make   
required certifications, or if you have been notified by the IRS that you are   
subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any 
amounts withheld may be credited against your federal income tax liability if   
you provide the required information or certification.                          

 A 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on the investment income of taxpayers in the
higher income brackets, which includes dividends and capital gains with respect 
to your Units in the Trust.                                                     

Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are           
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal,    
state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of  
an investment in the Trust. The Trust may make taxable distributions to you     
even during periods in which the value of Units has declined.                   

Termination of the Trust Agreement

  A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient  
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the        
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but   
in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the calendar year preceding the 
twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of a High Yield Trust. In    
the event of termination of a Trust, written notice thereof will be sent by the 
Trustee to each Unitholder at his address appearing on the registration books   
of the Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter the 
Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and shall deduct from    
the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided by   
the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs  
of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of  
any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The sale of bonds in a      
Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be     
realized if such sale were not required at such time. For this reason, among    
others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may be less than   
the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the Units held by    
such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each Unitholder his share 
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With such distribution   
the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount 
distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall         
determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it shall    
make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.                    

Estimated Cash Flows to Unitholders 

The table below sets forth the per Unit estimated monthly distributions of
interest and principal to Unitholders. The table assumes no changes in          
expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges, redemptions,  
sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or expected      
retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected          
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Dividend Sustainability Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above average capital
appreciation.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks derived from the S&P 500 Dividend
Aristocrats Index as of the close of business on January 27, 2014. The S&P 500
Dividend Aristocrats Index consists of stocks of those companies in the S&P 500
Index that have increased their actual dividend payments in each of the last 25
years. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of the Portfolio.


The Portfolio will consist of companies from the S&P 500 Dividend
Aristocrats Index that have attractive "dividend coverage", an S&P Capital IQ
Quality Rank of B or better and, if rated by Standard & Poor's, an S&P Credit
Rating of BBB or better. Dividend Coverage is calculated by Standard & Poor's
Investment Advisory Services LLC ("SPIAS") using a proprietary cash-flow,
sector-specific methodology and is licensed for use by the Sponsor and the
Portfolio.


Beginning with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, the Sponsor selects
the composition of the Portfolio by: (1) eliminating companies with a share
price below $5 at time of selection; (2) eliminating companies with an S&P
Credit Rating below BBB and companies with an S&P Capital IQ Quality Ranking
below B (companies which do not have an S&P Credit Rating may be included); (3)
further selecting companies based on factors including market capitalization,
earnings over the previous 12 months, debt-to-equity, and cash and equivalents;
and (4) ranking the remaining companies by SPIAS' dividend coverage metric.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    The Portfolio does not replicate all of the components of the S&P 500
Dividend Aristocrats Index or its component weightings and the stocks
in the Portfolio will not change if the index components, or their
weightings within the index, change. The performance of the Portfolio
will not correspond with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for
this reason and because the Portfolio incurs a sales charge and
expenses. The Portfolio is not intended to replicate the performance
of the index.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the
consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Negative
developments in these sectors will affect the value of your investment
more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into a
new trust every two years subject to the applicable reduced rollover sales
charge. Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for
every $10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    441
3 years        830
5 years      1,244
10 years     2,190


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the Portfolio does not
reach the estimated size, or if the value of the Portfolio or number of
outstanding units decline over the life of the trust, or if the actual
amount of the operating expenses exceeds the estimated amounts, the actual
amount of the operating expenses per 100 units would exceed the estimated
amounts. In some cases, the actual amount of operating expenses may
substantially differ from the amounts reflected above.


The maximum sales charge is 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit. The
initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge (maximum
of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining deferred
sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred sales
charge is fixed at $0.245 per Unit and accrues daily from May 10, 2014 through
October 9, 2014. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this charge on
the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid in full.
The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the
"transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period
(anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial Date of
Deposit.

International Dividend Sustainability Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above average capital
appreciation.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of international stocks and ADRs with a history of
increasing dividend distributions. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., the Sponsor,
only considered companies with a Standard & Poor's debt rating of "BBB-" or
higher and a minimum share price of $5 (USD) at the time of selection.
Companies considered for inclusion in the Portfolio must have recent dividend
per share growth and must meet certain market capitalization and liquidity
requirements.


The Sponsor selected the final portfolio through an analysis of numerous
factors including forward earnings and cash-flow projections, recent earnings
and free-cash-flow growth, debt-to-equity levels, and peer group analysis. No
more than 50% of the Portfolio will be invested in any one particular country,
and a minimum of 5 countries will be represented in the Portfolio at the time
of selection.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    Stocks of foreign companies in the Portfolio present risks beyond
those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include market and political
factors related to the company's foreign market, international trade
conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased
volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of
foreign currencies.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies
domiciled in both Canada and the United Kingdom. As a result,
political or economic developments in either Canada or the United
Kingdom may have a significant impact on the securities included in
the Portfolio.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the
consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Negative
developments in these sectors will affect the value of your investment
more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio



Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks above average capital
appreciation.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio of stocks and ADRs of companies selected by the
Sponsor, Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., from the S&P Europe 350 Dividend
Aristocrats Index as of the close of business on January 27, 2014. The S&P
Europe 350 Dividend Aristocrats Index consists of stocks of those companies in
the S&P Europe 350 Index that have increased their actual dividend payments
each of the last 10 years.


The Portfolio will consist of companies from the S&P Europe 350 Dividend
Aristocrats Index that have recent dividend per share growth and which meet
certain market capitalization and liquidity requirements. The Sponsor selected
the final portfolio through an analysis of numerous factors including forward
earnings and cash-flow projections, recent earnings and free-cash-flow growth,
debt-to-equity levels and peer group analysis.


The Portfolio is designed as part of a long-term investment strategy. The
Sponsor may offer a subsequent series of the portfolio when the current
Portfolio terminates. As a result, you may achieve more consistent overall
results by following the strategy over several years if subsequent series are
available. For more information see "Rights of Unitholders--Rollover".


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect.
This can happen for reasons such as these:


o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.


o    An issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the
future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may result
in a reduction in the value of your Units.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering
period.


o    Stocks of foreign companies in the Portfolio present risks beyond
those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include market and political
factors related to the company's foreign market, international trade
conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased
volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of
foreign currencies.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies
domiciled in the United Kingdom. As a result, political or economic
developments in the United Kingdom may have a significant impact on
the securities included in the Portfolio.


o    The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the
consumer staples sector. Negative developments in this sector will
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a
more diversified investment.


o    We do not actively manage the Portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of
the same securities even if their market value declines.

The amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect expenses that you
may incur based on a $10 Public Offering Price per Unit. Actual expenses may

Example



This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and
expenses will vary. This example also assumes that you continue to follow the
Portfolio strategy and roll your investment, including all distributions, into a
new trust every two years subject to the applicable reduced rollover sales
charge. Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following expenses for
every $10,000 you invest in the Portfolio:








1 year    $    468
3 years        906
5 years      1,369
10 years     2,441


------------------








*    The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for
the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain
of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the Portfolio does not
reach the estimated size, or if the value of the Portfolio or number of
outstanding units decline over the life of the trust, or if the actual
amount of the operating expenses exceeds the estimated amounts, the actual
amount of the operating expenses per 100 units would exceed the estimated
amounts. In some cases, the actual amount of operating expenses may
substantially differ from the amounts reflected above.


The maximum sales charge is 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit. The
initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge (maximum
of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining deferred
sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred sales
charge is fixed at $0.245 per Unit and accrues daily from May 10, 2014 through
October 9, 2014. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this charge on
the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid in full.
The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the
"transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period
(anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial Date of
Deposit.

Notes to Portfolios



(1)  The Securities are initially represented by "regular way" contracts for the
performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited
with the Trustee. Contracts to acquire Securities were entered into on
January 31, 2014 and have a settlement date of February 5, 2014 (see "The
Portfolios").


(2)  The value of each Security is determined on the bases set forth under
"Public Offering--Unit Price" as of the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on the business day before the Initial Date of Deposit. In
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Portfolio's investments are
classified as Level 1, which refers to security prices determined using
quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Other information
regarding the Securities, as of the Initial Date of Deposit, is as follows:

"+" indicates that the security was issued by a foreign company.


(3)  Current Dividend Yield for each Security is based on the estimated annual
dividends per share and the Security's value as of the most recent close of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day before the
Initial Date of Deposit. Generally, estimated annual dividends per share
are calculated by annualizing the most recently declared regular dividends
or by adding the most recent regular interim and final dividends declared
and reflect any foreign withholding taxes. In certain cases, this
calculation may consider several recently declared dividends in order for
the Current Dividend Yield to be more reflective of recent historical
dividend rates.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Unitholders of Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1399:



We have audited the accompanying statements of condition including the
related portfolios of Dividend Sustainability Portfolio 2014-1, International
Dividend Sustainability Portfolio 2014-1 and European Dividend Sustainability
Portfolio 2014-1 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1399) as of February
3, 2014. The statements of condition are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on such statements of condition based
on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the statements of condition are free of material misstatement. The
trusts are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of
their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trusts'
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the statements of condition, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as
well as evaluating the overall statements of condition presentation. Our
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of
cash or irrevocable letters of credit deposited for the purchase of Securities
as shown in the statements of condition as of February 3, 2014. We believe that
our audits of the statements of condition provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the statements of condition referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dividend
Sustainability Portfolio 2014-1, International Dividend Sustainability
Portfolio 2014-1 and European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio 2014-1
(included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1399) as of February 3, 2014, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

(1)  The value of the Securities is determined by the Trustee on the bases set
forth under "Public Offering--Unit Price". The contracts to purchase
Securities are collateralized by separate irrevocable letters of credit
which have been deposited with the Trustee.


(2)  A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to
pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a Portfolio.
The amount of these costs are set forth in the "Fee Table". A distribution
will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial offering period
(approximately three months) or six months following the Initial Date of
Deposit to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the organization
expense obligation of the investors will be satisfied. To the extent that
actual organization costs of a Portfolio are greater than the estimated
amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the Public Offering
Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the
Portfolio.


(3)  Represents the amount of mandatory distributions from a Portfolio on the
bases set forth under "Public Offering".


(4)  The creation and development fee is payable by a Portfolio on behalf of
Unitholders out of the assets of the Portfolio as of the close of the
initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the
initial public offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the
proceeds.


(5)  The aggregate public offering price and the aggregate sales charge are
computed on the bases set forth under "Public Offering".


(6)  Assumes the maximum sales charge.



THE PORTFOLIOS





The Portfolios were created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant
to a Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the
date of this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Invesco Capital
Markets, Inc., as Sponsor and Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor,
and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee.


The Portfolios offer investors the opportunity to purchase Units
representing proportionate interests in a portfolio of securities. A Portfolio
may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a
portfolio of securities with greater diversification than they might be able to
acquire individually.


On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee.
In exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor
documentation evidencing the ownership of Units of the Portfolios. Unless
otherwise terminated as provided in the Trust Agreement, your Portfolio will
terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date and any remaining Securities will
be liquidated or distributed by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used
in this prospectus the term "Securities" means the securities (including
contracts to purchase these securities) listed in the "Portfolios" and any
additional securities deposited into the Portfolios.


Additional Units of your Portfolio may be issued at any time by depositing
in the Portfolio (i) additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase
Securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash
(or a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase
additional Securities. As additional Units are issued by your Portfolio, the
aggregate value of the Securities will be increased and the fractional
undivided interest represented by each Unit may be decreased. The Sponsor may
continue to make additional deposits into your Portfolio following the Initial
Date of Deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which
will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same percentage relationship among
the number of shares of each Security in the Portfolio that existed immediately
prior to the subsequent deposit. Investors may experience a dilution of their
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations
in the prices of the Securities between the time of the deposit and the
purchase of the Securities and because your Portfolio will pay the associated
brokerage or acquisition fees. Due to round lot requirements in certain foreign
securities markets and market value fluctuations, your Portfolio may not be
able to invest in each Security on any subsequent date of deposit in the same
proportion as existed on the Initial Date of Deposit or immediately prior to
the subsequent deposit of Securities. This could increase the potential for
dilution of investments and variances in anticipated income. In addition,
during the initial offering of Units it may not be possible to buy a particular
Security due to regulatory or trading restrictions, or corporate actions. While
such limitations are in effect, additional Units would be created by purchasing
each of the Securities in your Portfolio that are not subject to those
limitations. This would also result in the dilution of the investment in any
such Security not purchased and potential variances in anticipated income.
Purchases and sales of Securities by your Portfolio may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of
Units, upon Portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit
redemptions.


Each Unit of your Portfolio initially offered represents an undivided
interest in the Portfolio. At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the
Initial Date of Deposit, the number of Units may be adjusted so that the Public
Offering Price per Unit equals $10. The number of Units, fractional interest of
each Unit in your Portfolio and the estimated distributions per Unit will
increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment. To the extent that any
Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are issued as a result of
additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the fractional undivided
interest in your Portfolio represented by each unredeemed Unit will increase or
decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in your Portfolio will
remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to
the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the
termination of the Trust Agreement.


Your Portfolio consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the
purchase thereof) listed under the applicable "Portfolio" as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Portfolio, (b) any additional Securities acquired
and held by the Portfolio pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and

(c) any cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the
Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any contract failure in
any of the Securities.

The Sponsor does not manage the Portfolios. You should note that the Sponsor
applied the selection criteria to the Securities for inclusion in your
Portfolio prior to the Initial Date of Deposit. After this time, the Securities
may no longer meet the selection criteria. Should a Security no longer meet the
selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security from its
Portfolio. In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor any
broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather the
entire pool of Securities in a Portfolio, taken as a whole, which are
represented by the Units.



RISK FACTORS





All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Portfolio. You should understand
these risks before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value
of your Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Portfolio will
achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any
period.


Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in
your Portfolio will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall
below your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or
ratings on a security of the issuer. Even though your Portfolio is supervised,
you should remember that we do not manage your Portfolio. Your Portfolio will
not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a
managed fund.


Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay dividends on a security. Stocks
represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the
issuers. Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the
company has provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred
stockholders. Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid
only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any
dividend may vary over time. If dividends received by your Portfolio are
insufficient to cover expenses, redemptions or other Portfolio costs, it may be
necessary for your Portfolio to sell Securities to cover such expenses,
redemptions or other costs. Any such sales may result in capital gains or
losses to you. See "Taxation".


Index Correlation. The Dividend Sustainability Portfolio will consist of
stocks from the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index and the European Dividend
Sustainability Portfolio will consist of stocks from the S&P Europe 350
Dividend Aristocrats Index. Your Portfolio does not seek to replicate all of
the components of the Index or its component weightings and the stocks in the
Portfolio will not change if the index components, or their weightings within
the index, change. The performance of your Portfolio will not correspond with
the index for this reason and because your Portfolio incurs a sales charge and
expenses.


Foreign Stocks. Because the International Dividend Sustainability Portfolio
and European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio invest exclusively in foreign
stocks, the Portfolios may involve additional risks that differ from an
investment in domestic stocks. These risks include the risk of losses due to
future political and economic developments, international trade conditions,
foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments or exchange
of securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or
repatriation of currencies.


The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S. Investments in these
countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts,
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult
for a Portfolio to vote proxies, exercise investor rights, and pursue legal
remedies with respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political
developments, including rapid and adverse political changes, social
instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies,
industries, and securities and currency markets, and the value of a Portfolio's
investments, in non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these
factors could have on a Portfolio's securities.


Certain stocks may be held in the form of American Depositary Receipts
("ADRs"), Global Depositary Receipts ("GDRs"), or other similar receipts. ADRs
and GDRs represent receipts for foreign common stock deposited with a custodian
(which may include the Trustee). The ADRs in your Portfolio, if any, trade in
the U.S. in U.S. dollars and are registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"). GDRs are receipts, issued by foreign banks or trust
companies, or foreign branches of U.S. banks, that represent an interest in
shares of either a foreign or U.S. corporation. These instruments may not
necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which
they may be converted. ADRs and GDRs generally involve the same types of risks
as foreign common stock held directly. Some ADRs and GDRs may experience less
liquidity than the underlying common stocks traded in their home market. The
Portfolios may invest in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs. Unlike a sponsored ADR
where the depositary has an exclusive relationship with the foreign issuer, an
unsponsored ADR may be created by a depositary institution independently and
without the cooperation of the foreign issuer. Consequently, information
concerning the foreign issuer may be less current or reliable for an
unsponsored ADR and the price of an unsponsored ADR may be more volatile than
if it was a sponsored ADR. Depositaries of unsponsored ADRs are not required to
distribute shareholder communications received from the foreign issuer or to
pass through voting rights to its holders. The holders of unsponsored ADRs
generally bear all the costs associated with establishing the unsponsored ADR,
whereas the foreign issuers typically bear certain costs in a sponsored ADR.


The purchase and sale of the foreign securities may occur in foreign
securities markets. Certain of the factors stated above may make it impossible
to buy or sell them in a timely manner or may adversely affect the value
received on a sale of securities. Custody of certain of the securities in your
Portfolio may be maintained by a global custody and clearing institution which
has entered into a sub-custodian relationship with the Trustee. In addition,
round lot trading requirements exist in certain foreign securities markets.
These round lot trading requirements could cause the proportional composition
and diversification of your Portfolio's securities to vary when the Portfolio
purchases additional securities or sells securities to satisfy expenses or Unit
redemptions. This could have a material impact on investment performance and
portfolio composition. Brokerage commissions and other fees generally are
higher for foreign securities. Government supervision and regulation of foreign
securities markets, currency markets, trading systems and brokers may be less
than in the U.S. The procedures and rules governing foreign transactions and
custody (holding of the Portfolios' assets) also may involve delays in payment,
delivery or recovery of money or investments.


Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies
than about most U.S. companies.


Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Portfolios may at times be
unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.


Because securities of foreign issuers not listed on a U.S. securities
exchange generally pay dividends and trade in foreign currencies, the U.S.
dollar value of these securities and dividends will vary with fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. Most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value
against the U.S. dollar for various economic and political reasons. To
determine the value of foreign securities or their dividends, the Trustee will
estimate current exchange rates for the relevant currencies based on activity
in the various currency exchange markets. However, these markets can be quite
volatile depending on the activity of the large international commercial banks,
various central banks, large multi-national corporations, speculators and other
buyers and sellers of foreign currencies. Since actual foreign currency
transactions may not be instantly reported, the exchange rates estimated by the
Trustee may not reflect the amount your Portfolio would receive in U.S.
dollars, had the Trustee sold any particular currency in the market. The value
of the Securities in terms of U.S. dollars, and therefore the value of your
Units, will decline if the U.S. dollar decreases in value relative to the value
of the currencies in which the Securities trade.


United Kingdom. The International Dividend Sustainability Portfolio and
European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio invest significantly in stocks
issued by companies located in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). As a result, your
Portfolio may be affected unfavorably by political developments, social
instability, changes in government policies and other political and economic
developments in the U.K. The U.K. is a member state of the European Union
("EU"), the establishment of which has had the effect of eliminating most
remaining trade barriers between member nations and has created one of the
largest common markets in the world. Unlike the majority of EU members, the
U.K. has not adopted the common EU currency of the euro. Adoption of the euro
has presented strategic challenges to all companies with significant markets or
operations in countries utilizing the euro. The Sponsor cannot predict when or
if the U.K. will convert to the euro, or what impact, if any, the adoption of
the euro by the U.K. would have on any of the securities issued by U.K.
companies in your Portfolio.


Canada. The International Dividend Sustainability Portfolio invests
significantly in stocks issued by companies headquartered, or with a
significant presence, in Canada. Canada is a major producer of commodities,
including forest products, metals, agricultural products and energy related
products, including oil, gas, and hydroelectricity. Accordingly, changes in the
supply and demand of base commodity resources and industrial and precious
metals and materials, both domestically and internationally, can have a
significant effect on Canadian market performance.


Industry Risks. The Portfolios invest significantly in certain industries.
Any negative impact on these industries will have a greater impact on the value
of Units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries. You should
understand the risks of these industries before you invest.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. The Portfolios invest
significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products.
General risks of these companies include the overall state of the economy,
intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in the economy
which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively
impact spending habits. Global factors including political developments,
imposition of import controls, fluctuations in oil prices, and changes in
exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and services.


Competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for
the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track
the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell
their products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers,
but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive. Changes in
demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the
success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Consumer
products and services companies may be subject to government regulation
affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact
performance. Tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws,
regulations and litigation.


Health Care Issuers. The European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio invests
significantly in health care companies. These issuers include companies
involved in advanced medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology,
managed care, hospital management/health services and medical supplies. These
companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures.


On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and
significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased
costs and changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict
the full impact of the Act on the Securities in your Portfolio.


As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose
legislative action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may
span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may
include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for
competition in the provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid
health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the
health care sector. The government could also reduce funding for health care
related research.


Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product
obsolescence, termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply
products and the risk that a product will never come to market. The research
and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are
substantial. This process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee
of approval. These companies may have losses and may not offer proposed
products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new
drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its
stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks
of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other litigation.


Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services,
the ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis
on outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers
and government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar
programs).


Legislation/Litigation. From time to time, various legislative initiatives
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact
on certain of the companies represented in your Portfolio, or on the tax
treatment of your Portfolio or of your investment in a Portfolio. In addition,
litigation regarding any of the issuers of the Securities or of the industries
represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these
Securities. No one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation
will have on the share prices of the Securities.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Portfolio is not a deposit of any
bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which consists of
the net asset value per Unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge. The
net asset value per Unit is the value of the securities, cash and other assets
in your Portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the Portfolio divided by the
total Units outstanding. The maximum sales charge equals 3.95% of the Public
Offering Price per Unit (4.11% of the aggregate offering price of the
Securities) at the time of purchase.


You pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy Units. The initial
sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage
(maximum of 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit) and the sum of the
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar
creation and development fee. The initial sales charge will be approximately
1.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit depending on the Public Offering
Price per Unit. The deferred sales charge is fixed at $0.245 per Unit. Your
Portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as described in the
"Fee Table." If any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day,
we will charge the payment on the next business day. If you purchase Units
after the initial deferred sales charge payment, you will only pay that portion
of the payments not yet collected. If you redeem or sell your Units prior to
collection of the total deferred sales charge, you will pay any remaining
deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your Units. The initial and
deferred sales charges are referred to as the "transactional sales charge." The
transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee
which compensates the Sponsor for creating and developing your Portfolio and is
described under "Expenses." The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit. Your Portfolio pays the creation and development fee as of the close
of the initial offering period as described in the "Fee Table." If you redeem
or sell your Units prior to collection of the creation and development fee, you
will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your
Units. Because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are
fixed dollar amounts per Unit, the actual charges will exceed the percentages
shown in the "Fee Table" if the Public Offering Price per Unit falls below $10
and will be less than the percentages shown in the "Fee Table" if the Public
Offering Price per Unit exceeds $10. In no event will the maximum total sales
charge exceed 3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.


Since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit
regardless of any decrease in net asset value. However, if the Public Offering
Price per Unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage
results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts
of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee, your initial
sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar
charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy Units. In such a
situation, the value of securities per Unit would exceed the Public Offering
Price per Unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value
of those securities will fluctuate, which could result in a benefit or
detriment to Unitholders that purchase Units at that price. The initial sales
charge credit is paid by the Sponsor and is not paid by your Portfolio. The
"Fee Table" shows the sales charge calculation at a $10 Public Offering Price
per Unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below
and above $10. If the Public Offering Price per Unit fell to $6, the maximum
sales charge would be $0.2370 (3.95% of the Public Offering Price per Unit),
which consists of an initial sales charge of -$0.0580, a deferred sales charge
of $0.245 and a creation and development fee of $0.05. If the Public Offering
Price per Unit rose to $14, the maximum sales charge would be $0.5530 (3.95% of
the Public Offering Price per Unit), consisting of an initial sales charge of
$0.2580, a deferred sales charge of $0.245 and the creation and development fee
of $0.05.


The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly
from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.


The minimum purchase is 100 Units (25 Units for retirement accounts) but may
vary by selling firm. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an
order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.


Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your financial professional of
your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible
for a reduced sales charge. As further described in this section, purchases
executed on the same day by a single person at the same broker-dealer may be
combined for sales charge discount calculation purposes. Secondary market
purchases are excluded for purposes of sales charge discount calculations.
Since the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit
regardless of any discounts. However, if you are eligible to receive a discount
such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the
deferred sales charges and creation and development fee, you will receive a
credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed
dollar charges at the time you buy Units.


Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. Based upon the aggregate dollar amount of Units
purchased by a Unitholder in the initial offering period, the following table
shows both the corresponding sales charge and the concession or agency
commission allowed to broker-dealers and other selling agents on such
transaction.








                                 Broker-Dealer
                                  Concession
      Transaction                  or Agency
        Amount      Sales Charge  Commission
----------------------------------------------
Less than $50,000       3.95%        3.15%
$50,000 - $99,999       3.70         2.90
$100,000 - $249,999     3.45         2.65
$250,000 - $499,999     3.10         2.35
$500,000 - $999,999     2.95         2.25
$1,000,000 or more      2.45         1.80








Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to
purchases of a single Portfolio made by the same person on a single day from a
single broker-dealer. We apply these sales charges as a percent of the Public
Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units
will be issued. Additional information regarding the broker-dealer concession
or agency commission is presented in the "Unit Distribution" section.


For purposes of achieving these levels, you may combine certain purchases
made on the same day through a single broker-dealer or selling agent, as
further described below. You must inform your broker-dealer of any combined
purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge. For
purposes of achieving the quantity discount levels in the above table, Units of
a Portfolio offered in this prospectus may be combined with (i) purchases of
units of any other Invesco-sponsored unit investment trusts during each trust's
initial offering period, (ii) purchases of units made as described under the
"Fee Accounts" paragraph in this section, and (iii) purchases of units eligible
for the sales charge discounts described under the "Rollovers and Exchanges"
paragraph in this section. In addition, Units purchased in the name of your
spouse (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) or children (including
step-children) under 21 living in the same household as you will be deemed to
be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the applicable
quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also be
applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust,
estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or fiduciary
account.


Fee Accounts. Investors may purchase Units through registered investment
advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in
each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed ("Fee
Accounts"). If Units of a Portfolio are purchased for a Fee Account and the
Portfolio is subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e., the Portfolio is "Wrap Fee
Eligible"), then the purchase will not be subject to the transactional sales
charge but will be subject to the creation and development fee of $0.05 per
Unit that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section called "Fee
Accounts" for additional information on these purchases. The Sponsor reserves
the right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in this paragraph by
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be
detrimental to a Portfolio. As described above in "Large Quantity Purchases",
Units purchased for a Fee Account may be combined with certain other purchases
for purposes of achieving the quantity discount levels presented in the table
above under "Large Quantity Purchases", however, such Wrap Fee Eligible Units
are not eligible for any sales charge discounts in addition to that which is
described in this paragraph and under the "Fee Accounts" section found below.


Rollovers and Exchanges. During the initial offering period of the
Portfolios offered in this prospectus, unitholders of any Invesco-sponsored
unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit investment trusts
may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such trusts to
purchase Units of the Portfolios offered in this prospectus, or units of any
other Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust in its initial offering period,
at a reduced sales charge. For such aggregated purchases of less than
$1,000,000, Units may be purchased at the Public Offering Price per Unit less
1.00%. For such aggregated purchases of $1,000,000 or more, either made solely
with redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts or in
combination with other purchases as described above under "Large Quantity
Purchases", Units will be eligible for the applicable quantity discount level
presented in the table that appears in that subsection. For aggregated
purchases described above in the "Large Quantity Purchases" subsection that
consist of any units other than Units of any Portfolio in this prospectus,
please refer to the prospectus of the applicable Invesco-sponsored unit
investment trust for information regarding the specified sales charge
reductions on those units. In order to be eligible for the sales charge
discounts applicable to Unit purchases made with redemption or termination
proceeds from other unit investment trusts, the trade date of each rollover or
redemption, or each other trust's termination date resulting in the receipt of
such proceeds used to purchase Units of the Portfolio must all be derived from
transactions that occurred within 30 calendar days prior to your Unit purchase.
In addition, the discounts will only be available for investors that utilize
the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate
notification) for both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the
receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase.
You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or other information
to your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales
charge discounts. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on the redemption
or termination of an interest in a trust.


Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses (or
the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or step-children
under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents and trustees,
custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Invesco Capital
Markets, Inc. and its affiliates, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase
Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All
employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm.
Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow their employees
to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the
discounts.


Distribution Reinvestments. We do not charge any sales charge when you
reinvest distributions from your Portfolio into additional Units of your
Portfolio. Since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are
fixed dollar amounts per unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per
unit regardless of this discount. If you elect to reinvest distributions, the
Sponsor will credit you with additional Units with a dollar value sufficient to
cover the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge and creation and
development fee that will be collected on such Units at the time of
reinvestment. The dollar value of these Units will fluctuate over time.


Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Essential Information" in accordance with fluctuations in the
prices of the underlying Securities in the Portfolios. The initial price of the
Securities upon deposit by the Sponsor was determined by the Trustee. The
Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and
under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", means any day on which the
New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading. The Public Offering Price
per Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time
on each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation
Time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a
timely manner.


The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as
determined under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent
pricing service used by the Trustee. In these cases, a Portfolio's net asset
value will reflect certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their
market price. With respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign
exchanges, the value of the portfolio securities may change on days when you
will not be able to purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities
is based on the applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time.
The Sponsor will provide price dissemination and oversight services to the
Portfolios.


During the initial offering period, part of the Public Offering Price
represents an amount that will pay the costs incurred in establishing your
Portfolio. These costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to
your Portfolio (such as the registration statement, prospectus, trust agreement
and legal documents), federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and
expenses of the Trustee and the initial audit. Your Portfolio will sell
securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering
period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will decline
when your Portfolio pays these costs.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price. Units repurchased in
the secondary market, if any, may be offered by this prospectus at the
secondary market Public Offering Price in the manner described above.


Unit Sales Concessions. Brokers, dealers and others will be allowed a
regular concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of
Units during the initial offering period as set forth in the "Broker-Dealer
Concession or Agency Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales
Charge -- Large Quantity Purchases". For transactions involving unitholders of
other unit investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds
to purchase Units of the Portfolio, the regular concession or agency commission
will amount to 2.15% per Unit (1.80% per Unit for aggregated purchases of
$1,000,000 or more).


Volume Concession Based Upon Annual Sales. As described below,
broker-dealers and other selling agents may in certain cases be eligible for an
additional concession based upon their annual eligible sales of all Invesco
fixed income and equity unit investment trusts. Eligible sales include all
units of any Invesco unit investment trust underwritten or purchased directly
from Invesco during a trust's initial offering period. For purposes of this
concession, trusts designated as either "Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income
Series" or "Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series" are fixed income trusts, and
trusts designated as "Invesco Unit Trusts Series" are equity trusts. In
addition to the regular concessions or agency commissions described above in
"Unit Sales Concessions", for sales occurring on or after July 1, 2013, all
broker-dealers and other selling firms will be eligible to receive additional
compensation based on total initial offering period sales of all eligible
Invesco unit investment trusts during the previous consecutive 12-month period
through the end of the most recent month. The Volume Concession, as applicable
to equity and fixed income trust units, is set forth in the following table:








                                Volume Concession
                               -------------------

$5,000 or more                  0.175       0.100








Broker-dealers and other selling firms will not receive the Volume
Concession on the sale of units purchased in Fee Accounts, however, such sales
will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level
breakpoints set forth in the Volume Concession table above. Secondary market
sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for purposes of the Volume
Concession. Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing
firms that place orders with Invesco and provide Invesco with information with
respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible dealer
firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely provide
clearing services to other broker-dealer firms or firms who place orders
through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We reserve the right to
change the amount of the concessions or agency commissions from time to time.
For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation, the trust's
prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional compensation.


Additional Information. Except as provided in this section, any sales charge
discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling broker-dealer or
agent. For all secondary market transactions the total concession or agency
commission will amount to 80% of the sales charge. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of any concessions, agency
commissions and any additional compensation allowed or paid to any broker,
dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any individual transaction
exceed the total sales charge applicable to such transaction. The Sponsor
reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase
of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to
dealers and others from time to time.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Portfolios
and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional
sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors
for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or
related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of the Portfolios and our other products. Fees may
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for
your Units.


Sponsor Compensation. The Sponsor will receive the total sales charge
applicable to each transaction. Except as provided under "Unit Distribution,"
any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling
dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or loss as a
result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by the
Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to your Portfolio on the Initial Date of
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. See "Notes to Portfolios". The
Sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member
of the underwriting syndicates or as an agent in a private placement for any of
the Securities. The Sponsor may realize profit or loss as a result of the
possible fluctuations in the market value of Units held by the Sponsor for sale
to the public. In maintaining a secondary market, the Sponsor will realize
profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which
Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which price
includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased Units
at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available to
the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the
Sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


The Sponsor or an affiliate may have participated in a public offering of
one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may
have a long or short position in these Securities or related securities. An
affiliate may act as a specialist or market maker for these Securities. An
officer, director or employee of the Sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer
or director for issuers of the Securities.


Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may
maintain a market for Units and to purchase Units at the secondary market
repurchase price (which is described under "Right of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units"). The Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is
not maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them
to the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. Units sold prior to
the time the entire deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed
the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge at the time of sale. The
Trustee will notify the Sponsor of any Units tendered for redemption. If the
Sponsor's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Sponsor may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.



RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS





Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit
sharing plans for employees. The minimum purchase for these accounts is reduced
to 25 Units but may vary by selling firm. The purchase of Units may be limited
by the plans' provisions and does not itself establish such plans.





FEE ACCOUNTS





As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where a Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these
accounts. This table illustrates the sales charge you will pay if a Portfolio
is Wrap Fee Eligible as a percentage of the initial Public Offering Price per
Unit on the Initial Date of Deposit (the percentage will vary thereafter).






Initial sales charge             0.00%
Deferred sales charge            0.00
                                 -----
      Transactional sales charge 0.00%
                                 =====
Creation and development fee     0.50%
                                 -----
      Total sales charge         0.50%
                                 =====








You should consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section
for specific information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section
governs the calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the
right to limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or
selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental
to a Portfolio. To purchase Units in these Fee Accounts, your financial
professional must purchase Units designated with one of the Wrap Fee CUSIP
numbers set forth under "Essential Information," either Wrap Fee Cash for cash
distributions or Wrap Fee Reinvest for the reinvestment of distributions in
additional Units, if available. See "Rights of Unitholders--Reinvestment
Option."



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions. Dividends and interest, net of expenses, and any net proceeds
from the sale of Securities received by a Portfolio will generally be
distributed to Unitholders on each Distribution Date to Unitholders of record
on the preceding Record Date. These dates appear under "Essential Information".
In addition, the Portfolios will generally make required distributions at the
end of each year because each is structured as a "regulated investment company"
for federal tax purposes. Unitholders will also receive a final distribution of
income when their Portfolio terminates. A person becomes a Unitholder of record
on the date of settlement (generally three business days after Units are
ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive distributions in cash or to have
distributions reinvested into additional Units. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Reinvestment Option".


Dividends and interest received by a Portfolio are credited to the Income
Account of the Portfolio. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from
the sale of Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds
received on the sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet
redemptions of Units or pay deferred sales charges, fees or expenses, will be
distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received from the disposition of any
Securities after a Record Date and prior to the following Distribution Date
will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next
Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders consists of each
Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income and Capital
Accounts as of the related Record Date.


Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated
net annual income per Unit may be shown under "Essential Information."
Generally, the estimate of the income a Portfolio may receive is based on the
most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an issuer, the most recent
interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers, or scheduled
income payments (in all cases accounting for any applicable foreign withholding
taxes). In certain cases, estimated net annual income may also be based upon
several recently declared dividends of an issuer. However, common stocks do not
assure dividend payments and therefore the amount of future dividend income to
your Portfolio is uncertain. The actual net annual distributions may decrease
over time because a portion of the Securities included in a Portfolio will be
sold to pay for the organization costs, deferred sales charge and creation and
development fee. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses
during a Portfolio's life. Dividend and income conventions for certain
companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the
United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over
several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions.
The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the
estimated amount due to changes in a Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual
income received by a Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in a
Portfolio such as the acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to
these and various other factors, actual income received by a Portfolio will
most likely differ from the most recent dividends or scheduled income
payments.


Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically
reinvested in additional Units without a sales charge (to the extent Units may
be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the Unitholder resides). The
CUSIP numbers for either "Cash" distributions or "Reinvest" for the
reinvestment of distributions are set forth under "Essential Information".
Brokers and dealers can use the Dividend Reinvestment Service through
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or purchase a Reinvest (or Wrap Fee Reinvest
in the case of Wrap Fee Eligible Units held in Fee Accounts) CUSIP, if
available. To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder must file
with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any other
documentation that the Trustee may then require, at least five days prior to
the related Record Date. A Unitholder's election will apply to all Units owned
by the Unitholder and will remain in effect until changed by the Unitholder.
The reinvestment option is not offered during the 30 calendar days prior to
termination. If Units are unavailable for reinvestment or this reinvestment
option is no longer available, distributions will be paid in cash.
Distributions will be taxable to Unitholders if paid in cash or automatically
reinvested in additional Units. See "Taxation".


A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and
receive future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no
later than five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor shall have the
right to suspend or terminate the reinvestment plan at any time. The
reinvestment plan is subject to availability or limitation by each
broker-dealer or selling firm. Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the
offering of a reinvestment plan at any time. Please contact your financial
professional for additional information.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three
business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to
receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit
next computed on the date of tender. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the
date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that with respect to
Units received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time or on a day which is
not a business day, the date of tender is deemed to be the next business day.
Redemption requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and
redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the
Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not
transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are
priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they
are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of
authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by
them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing
redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not
subject to such fees.


Unitholders tendering 1,000 or more Units of the Dividend Sustainability
Portfolio or International Dividend Sustainability Portfolio (or such higher
amount as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent) for
redemption may request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. The European Dividend
Sustainability Portfolio will generally not offer in kind distributions.
Unitholders may not request an in kind distribution during the initial offering
period or within 30 calendar days of a Portfolio's termination. Your Portfolio
generally will not offer in kind distributions of portfolio securities that are
held in foreign markets. An in kind distribution will be made by the Trustee
through the distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the
account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at DTC. Amounts representing
fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the
number of shares of any Security included in a Unitholder's in kind
distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole shares. The in kind
distribution option may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Unitholder requesting an in kind
distribution is the Sponsor or an affiliated person of a Portfolio, the Trustee
may make an in kind distribution to such Unitholder provided that no one with a
pecuniary incentive to influence the in kind distribution may influence
selection of the distributed securities, the distribution must consist of a pro
rata distribution of all portfolio securities (with limited exceptions) and the
in kind distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the detriment of
any other Unitholder.


The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in kind or sold, the size of a Portfolio will be,
and the diversity of a Portfolio may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a
time when Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices
than might otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be
more or less than the amount paid by the Unitholder depending on the value of
the Securities at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax
consequences will result if a Unitholder requests an in kind distribution. See
"Taxation".


The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in your Portfolio determined
on the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Portfolio, (ii) the value of the
Securities in the Portfolio and (iii) dividends or other income distributions
receivable on the Securities in the Portfolio trading ex-dividend as of the
date of computation, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental
charges payable out of the Portfolio, (b) the accrued expenses of the Portfolio
(including costs associated with liquidating securities after the end of the
initial offering period) and (c) any unpaid deferred sales charge payments.
During the initial offering period, the redemption price and the secondary
market repurchase price are not reduced by the estimated organization costs or
the creation and development fee. For these purposes, the Trustee will
determine the value of the Securities as described under "Public Offering--Unit
Price".


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC
determines that trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists,
as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably
practicable, or for other periods as the SEC may permit.


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Portfolio or when your
Portfolio terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other
Invesco unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your
financial professional for more information about trusts currently available
for exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the
new trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss
this option with your financial professional to determine whether your
investment goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss
tax consequences. An exchange is a taxable event to you. We may discontinue
this option at any time.


Rollover. We may offer a subsequent series of each Portfolio for a Rollover
when the Portfolios terminate.


On the Mandatory Termination Date you will have the option to (1)
participate in a Rollover and have your Units reinvested into a subsequent
trust series or (2) receive a cash distribution.


If you elect to participate in a cash Rollover, your Units will be redeemed
on the Mandatory Termination Date. As the redemption proceeds become available,
the proceeds (including dividends) will be invested in a new trust series at
the public offering price for the new trust. The Trustee will attempt to sell
Securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the Mandatory
Termination Date. We do not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than
one day, however, certain factors could affect the ability to sell the
Securities and could impact the length of the sale period. The liquidity of any
Security depends on the daily trading volume of the Security and the amount
available for redemption and reinvestment on any day.


We may make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times
during the year. Of course, we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or
sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the
same investment strategies or objectives as the current Portfolios. We cannot
guarantee that a Rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences
resulting from trading large volumes of securities. Market price trends may
make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than
permitted by the Portfolio procedures. We may, in our sole discretion, modify a
Rollover or stop creating units of a trust at any time regardless of whether
all proceeds of Unitholders have been reinvested in a Rollover. If we decide
not to offer a subsequent series, Unitholders will be notified prior to the
Mandatory Termination Date. Cash which has not been reinvested in a Rollover
will be distributed to Unitholders shortly after the Mandatory Termination
Date. Rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or realize taxable
capital gains which are reinvested in connection with a Rollover but may not be
entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the "wash sale" tax rules.
Due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust, no cash will be distributed to
pay any taxes. See "Taxation".


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at DTC. Units are transferable by contacting your
bank or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. Transfer, and the
requirements therefore, will be governed by the applicable procedures of DTC
and your agreement with the DTC participant in whose name your Units are
registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and
other amounts received by a Portfolio for each distribution. Within a
reasonable time after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder
during that year will receive a statement describing dividends and capital
received, actual Portfolio distributions, Portfolio expenses, a list of the
Securities and other Portfolio information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations
of the Securities upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding
your account or your Portfolio, please contact your financial advisor or the
Trustee. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION





Portfolio Administration. Your Portfolio is not a managed fund and, except
as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold or
replaced. The Sponsor may, however, direct that Securities be sold in certain
limited circumstances to protect your Portfolio based on advice from the
Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the issuer having
defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a
Security has declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so that
in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would be detrimental
to your Portfolio. If a public tender offer has been made for a Security or a
merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the Trustee may
either sell the Security or accept an offer if the Supervisor determines that
the sale or exchange is in the best interest of Unitholders. The Trustee will
distribute any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In addition, the Trustee may sell
Securities to redeem Units or pay Portfolio expenses or deferred sales charges.
If securities or property are acquired by a Portfolio, the Sponsor may direct
the Trustee to sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds to
Unitholders or to accept the securities or property for deposit in your
Portfolio. Should any contract for the purchase of any of the Securities fail,
the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the moneys held in a Portfolio to
cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute Securities in accordance with
the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales charge attributable to the
failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the next Distribution Date.


The Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
Securities if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors
which, in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the Securities
detrimental to your Portfolio. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not
obligated to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities
that meet the criteria for inclusion in your Portfolio on the Initial Date of
Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to
ensure that your Portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a
regulated investment company and to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed
income of the Portfolio.


When your Portfolio sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the
Securities in the Portfolio may be altered. In order to obtain the best price
for a Portfolio, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum
amounts (generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In
effecting purchases and sales of Portfolio securities, the Sponsor may direct
that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers,
including brokers which may be affiliated with your Portfolio, the Sponsor or
dealers participating in the offering of Units.


Pursuant to an exemptive order, your Portfolio may be permitted to sell
Securities to a new trust when it terminates if those Securities are included
in the new trust. The exemption may enable your Portfolio to eliminate
commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities will be
the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the Securities
are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.


Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially
adversely affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and
the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of
Units or permit acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for
the Securities (except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will
notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination. Your Portfolio will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date
specified under "Essential Information" or upon the sale or other disposition
of the last Security held in the Portfolio. A Portfolio may be terminated at
any time with consent of Unitholders representing two-thirds of the outstanding
Units or by the Trustee when the value of the Portfolio is less than $500,000
($3,000,000 if the value of the Portfolio has exceeded $15,000,000) (the
"Minimum Termination Value"). A Portfolio will be liquidated by the Trustee in
the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Portfolio not yet sold are
tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Portfolio
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time
they were deposited in the Portfolio. If your Portfolio is liquidated because
of the redemption of unsold Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to
each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The
Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a Portfolio termination
nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory Termination Date.
Qualified Unitholders may elect an in kind distribution of Securities, provided
that Unitholders may not request an in kind distribution of Securities within
30 calendar days of a Portfolio's termination. Any in kind distribution of
Securities will be made in the manner and subject to the restrictions described
under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", provided that, in
connection with an in kind distribution election more than 30 calendar days
prior to termination, Unitholders tendering 1,000 or more Units of a Portfolio
(or such higher amount as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling
agent) may request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders will receive a
final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the Mandatory
Termination Date. All distributions will be net of Portfolio expenses and
costs. Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following
termination. The Information Supplement contains further information regarding
termination of your Portfolio. See "Additional Information".


Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor and Trustee are under no
liability for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in
good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but
shall be liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence (negligence in the case of the Trustee) in the performance of their
duties or by reason of their reckless disregard of their obligations and duties
hereunder. The Trustee is not liable for depreciation or loss incurred by
reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of the Securities. In the event of the
failure of the Sponsor to act under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act
thereunder and is not liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the
Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable for any taxes or other governmental
charges imposed on the Securities, on it as Trustee under the Trust Agreement
or on a Portfolio which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present or
future law of the United States of America or of any other taxing authority
having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust Agreement contains other customary
provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee. The Sponsor and Supervisor
may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Trustee and have no responsibility
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.


Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Portfolio. The
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide
range of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and
high net worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is
located at 11 Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of September 30,
2013, the total stockholders' equity of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. was
$91,972,536 (unaudited). The current assets under management and supervision by
Invesco Ltd. and its affiliates were valued at approximately $745.5 billion as
of September 30, 2013.


The Sponsor and your Portfolio have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Invesco Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Portfolio
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the
code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,
deception or misconduct with respect to your Portfolio. The Information
Supplement contains additional information about the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the SEC, (ii) terminate the
Trust Agreement and liquidate your Portfolio as provided therein or (iii)
continue to act as Trustee without terminating the Trust Agreement.


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 856-8487. If you have questions regarding your
account or your Portfolio, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit
investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The Sponsor does
not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New York Mellon
is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the
State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and
its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the
extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding the Trustee is set
forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and
duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and
the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional
Information".



TAXATION





This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of the Portfolios as of the date of this
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect, and this summary does not describe all of the tax
consequences to all taxpayers. For example, this summary generally does not
describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a
broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, financial institution, person who marks to
market their Units or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,
this section does not describe your alternative minimum, state, local or
foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your Portfolio.


Additional information related to taxes is contained in the Information
Supplement. As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your
individual circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Portfolio Status. Your Portfolio intends to elect and to qualify annually as
a "regulated investment company" under the federal tax laws. If your Portfolio
qualifies under the tax law as a regulated investment company and distributes
its income consistently with such qualification, the Portfolio generally will
not pay federal income taxes. But there is no assurance that the distributions
made by your Portfolio will eliminate all taxes for every year at the level of
your Portfolio.


Distributions. Portfolio distributions are generally taxable to you. After
the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement reporting your
Portfolio's distributions, including the amounts of ordinary income
distributions and capital gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are
generally taxed at your tax rate for ordinary income, however, as further
discussed below, certain ordinary income distributions received from your
Portfolio may be taxed, under current law, at the capital gains tax rates.
Certain ordinary income dividends on Units that are attributable to qualifying
dividends received by your Portfolio from certain corporations may be reported
by the Portfolio as being eligible for the dividends received deduction for
corporate Unitholders provided certain holding period requirements are met.
Income from the Portfolio may also be subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax imposed
generally on investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain
threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples filing
joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals. In addition, your
Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax
purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any
additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital
gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. The tax status of your
distributions from your Portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your
distributions in additional Units or receive them in cash. The income from your
Portfolio that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax
laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in January as
if you had received them on December 31 of the previous year.


A distribution paid by your Portfolio reduces the Portfolio's net asset
value per Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly,
a distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would
represent, in substance, a partial return of capital, however, it would be
subject to income taxes.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the
amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you
purchase your Units.


Capital Gains and Losses and Certain Ordinary Income Dividends. If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain under
current law is generally 20%. Taxpayers whose marginal ordinary income bracket
is below 25% are generally not subject to tax on their net capital gains.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your Portfolio and sell your Units at a loss after
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as
long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The
tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special
situations.


In certain circumstances, ordinary income dividends received by an
individual Unitholder from a regulated investment company such as your
Portfolio may be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied
and provided the dividends are attributable to qualified dividend income
received by the Portfolio itself. Each Portfolio will provide notice to its
Unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account
as qualified dividend income which is eligible for the capital gains tax
rates.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Portfolio securities
when you redeem your Units. In general, this distribution will be treated as a
sale for federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss, based
on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received.
The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that a loss is not currently
deductible.


Rollovers and Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your
Portfolio rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal
income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain,
and, in general, any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss
realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units
disposed of are replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) within a
period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after disposition
of Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or
enters into an option or contract to acquire, substantially identical stock or
securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to
reflect the disallowed loss.


Deductibility of Portfolio Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by your
Portfolio will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some
cases, however, you may be required to treat your portion of these Portfolio
expenses as income. In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for
these expenses. However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as
investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all
of these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Such
deductions may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds
certain levels.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), generally, subject to applicable tax treaties, distributions to you
from your Portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax
purposes (other than dividends which the Portfolio reports as capital gain
dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding
taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below. You may be eligible under
certain income tax treaties for a reduction in withholding rates. However,
distributions received by a foreign investor from a Portfolio that are properly
reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that your Portfolio
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Portfolio's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on
gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if
paid to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign
financial institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes
certain due diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations,

(ii) if the foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it
identifies certain of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is
otherwise excepted under FATCA. Withholding under FATCA is required: (i) with
respect to certain distributions from your Portfolio beginning on July 1, 2014;
and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds
from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after January 1, 2017. If
withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to your Units,
investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or that otherwise
would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such payment generally
will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit
of such exemption or reduction. Your Portfolio will not pay any additional
amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should consult your tax
advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual circumstances.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your Portfolio invests in any foreign securities, the
tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your
Portfolio paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will
include your share of the taxes your Portfolio paid to other countries. You may
be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes if your
Portfolio meets certain requirements for passing through such deductions or
credits to you.


Backup Withholding. By law, your Portfolio must withhold as backup
withholding a percentage (currently 28%) of your taxable distributions and
redemption proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or
taxpayer identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup
withholding, or if the IRS instructs your Portfolio to do so.


Investors should consult their advisors concerning the federal, state, local
and foreign tax consequences of investing in a Portfolio.



PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES





General. The fees and expenses of your Portfolio will generally accrue on a
daily basis. Portfolio operating fees and expenses are generally paid out of
the Income Account to the extent funds are available, and then from the Capital
Account. The deferred sales charge, creation and development fee and
organization costs are generally paid out of the Capital Account of your
Portfolio. It is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts
which will result in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation".
These sales will reduce future income distributions. The Sponsor's,
Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval of the
Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category
"Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
Consumers or, if this category is not published, in a comparable category.


Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the
establishment of your Portfolio. These costs and charges will include the cost
of the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration
statement and other documents relating to your Portfolio, federal and state
registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, and
legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering Price of Units includes the
estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from
your Portfolio's assets at the end of the initial offering period.


Creation and Development Fee. The Sponsor will receive a fee from your
Portfolio for creating and developing the Portfolio, including determining the
Portfolio's objectives, policies, composition and size, selecting service
providers and information services and for providing other similar
administrative and ministerial functions. The creation and development fee is a
charge of $0.05 per Unit. The Trustee will deduct this amount from your
Portfolio's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. No portion
of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as
compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be deducted from proceeds
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of Units before the close of
the initial public offering period.


Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from your
Portfolio set forth in the "Fee Table" (which includes the estimated amount of
miscellaneous Portfolio expenses). The Trustee benefits to the extent there are
funds in the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest
bearing to Unitholders and the amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by
the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services to your
Portfolio is expected to result from the use of these funds.


Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fees for
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory
services set forth in the "Fee Table". These fees may exceed the actual costs
of providing these services to your Portfolio but at no time will the total
amount received for these services rendered to all Invesco unit investment
trusts in any calendar year exceed the aggregate cost of providing these
services in that year.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by your Portfolio: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the
Portfolio, (b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of
the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated
by the Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any
action taken by the Trustee to protect the Portfolio and the rights and
interests of Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred in the administration of the Portfolio without
negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial
and transaction fees (which may include compensation paid to the Trustee or its
subsidiaries or affiliates), (h) costs associated with liquidating the
securities held in the Portfolio, (i) any offering costs incurred after the end
of the initial offering period and (j) expenditures incurred in contacting
Unitholders upon termination of the Portfolio. Your Portfolio may pay the
expenses of updating its registration statement each year. The Dividend
Sustainability Portfolio will pay a license fee to Standard & Poor's Investment
Advisory Services LLC, for the use of certain trademarks and other property.
The European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio will pay a license fee to
Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, for the use of certain trademarks and
other property.

RISK FACTORS



Price Volatility. Because the Portfolios invest in securities of U.S. and
foreign companies, you should understand the risks of investing in securities
before purchasing Units. These risks include the risk that the financial
condition of the company or the general condition of the securities markets may
worsen and the value of the securities (and therefore Units) will fall.
Securities are especially susceptible to general market movements. The value of
securities often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence
and perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on factors
including expectations regarding government economic policies, inflation,
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates and
economic or banking crises. The value of Units will fluctuate with the value of
the securities in a Portfolio and may be more or less than the price you
originally paid for your Units. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee
that the performance of a Portfolio will be positive over any period of time.
Because the Portfolios are unmanaged, the Trustee will not sell securities in
response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments.


Dividends. Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company. Common stockholders have a right to receive
payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors,
bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that common
stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of
directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if
the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.


Foreign Stocks. Because certain Portfolios invest in foreign stocks, these
Portfolios involve additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic
stocks. Investments in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk
than those in domestic securities. There is generally less publicly available
information about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar
to those that are published about issuers in the United States. Also, foreign
issuers are generally not subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial
reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to United States issuers.
With respect to certain foreign countries, there is the possibility of adverse
changes in investment or exchange control regulations, expropriation,
nationalization or confiscatory taxation, limitations on the removal of funds
or other assets of a Portfolio, political or social instability, or diplomatic
developments which could affect United States investments in those countries.
Moreover, industrial foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from
the United States' economy in terms of growth of gross national product, rate
of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of
payments position. Foreign securities markets are generally not as developed or
efficient as those in the United States. While growing in volume, they usually
have substantially less volume than the New York Stock Exchange, and securities
of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of
comparable United States issuers. Fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are
generally higher than negotiated commissions on United States exchanges. There
is generally less government supervision and regulation of securities
exchanges, brokers and listed issuers than in the United States.


Foreign Currencies. Certain Portfolios also involve the risk that
fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies
may negatively affect the value of the stocks. For example, if a foreign stock
rose 10% in price but the U.S. dollar gained 5% against the related foreign
currency, a U.S. investor's return would be reduced to about 5%. This is
because the foreign currency would "buy" fewer dollars or, conversely, a dollar
would buy more of the foreign currency. Many foreign currencies have fluctuated
widely against the U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons such as supply and
demand of the currency, investor perceptions of world or country economies,
political instability, currency speculation by institutional investors, changes
in government policies, buying and selling of currencies by central banks of
countries, trade balances and changes in interest rates. A Portfolio's foreign
currency transactions will be conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as
principals on a spot (i.e., cash) buying basis. These dealers realize a profit
based on the difference between the price at which they buy the currency (bid
price) and the price at which they sell the currency (offer price). The Trustee
will estimate the currency exchange rates based on current activity in the
related currency exchange markets, however, due to the volatility of the
markets and other factors, the estimated rates may not be indicative of the
rate a Portfolio might obtain had the Trustee sold the currency in the market
at that time.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. The Portfolios may
invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products. The
profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including
the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends. In the past,
there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration
of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail
industry, particularly the department store segment. The continued viability of
the retail industry will depend on the industry's ability to adapt and to
compete in changing economic and social conditions, to attract and retain
capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in the banking or real
estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown
in employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked
deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in
significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely
affecting consumer spending habits. Increasing employee and retiree benefit
costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the
retail industry, competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging
consumer tastes and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent
increase in trade opportunities with other countries, American retailers are
now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening
of foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to local conditions and
constraints and added research costs.


Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in a Portfolio are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be
liquid. The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or
absent.


Additional Units. The Sponsor may create additional Units of a Portfolio by
depositing into the Portfolio additional stocks or cash with instructions to
purchase additional stocks. A deposit could result in a dilution of your
investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the
stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and
because a Portfolio will pay brokerage or acquisition fees.


Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in a Portfolio. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in your
Portfolio. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The
Trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by
other shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.

Portfolio or to any other Series thereof. The information is included herein
only for the purpose of informing investors as to the financial responsibility
of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out its contractual obligations. More
detailed financial information will be made available by the Sponsor upon
request).


The Sponsor and your Portfolio have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Invesco Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Portfolio
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the
code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,
deception or misconduct with respect to your Portfolio.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Portfolios as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.



TRUSTEE INFORMATION



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Portfolios.


In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for each Portfolio.
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of
each Portfolio held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open
to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from
time to time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,
together with a current list of the Securities held in each Portfolio.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor
trustee promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been
appointed and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification,
the retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The
resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor
trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.


Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.



TAXATION



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning the Portfolios and the purchase, ownership and disposition of
Portfolio Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and
is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Portfolio Units, as
well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality,
non-U.S. country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your Portfolio.


The Portfolios intend to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated
investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it
will not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its
Unitholders.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, a Portfolio must, among other
things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from
dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from
the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or
other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,
securities or currencies, and net income from qualified publicly traded
partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Portfolio's
assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S.
government securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies
and other securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally
limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5%
of the value of the Portfolio's total assets and not greater than 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the
value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S.
government securities or the securities of other regulated investment
companies) of any one issuer, or two or more issuers which the Portfolio
controls (by owning 20% or more of the issuer's outstanding voting securities)
and which are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses, or
the securities of qualified publicly traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at
least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes, among other
items, dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains in excess of net
long-term capital losses but excludes net capital gain, if any) and at least
90% of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any, each taxable year.


As a regulated investment company, your Portfolio generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as
that term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for
dividends paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain
over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders.
Your Portfolio intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually,
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital
gain. If a Portfolio retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable
income, it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate
rates on the amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely
basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject
to a nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, a Portfolio distributes
during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the
calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains
for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those years. To
prevent application of the excise tax, your Portfolio intends to make its
distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement.
Further, if a Portfolio retains any net capital gain, the Portfolio may
designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to
Unitholders who, if subject to federal income tax on long-term capital gains

(i) will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes, as
long-term capital gain, their share of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will
be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the
Portfolio against their federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim
refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. A distribution will
be treated as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is
declared by a Portfolio in October, November or December with a record date in
such a month and paid by the Portfolio during January of the following calendar
year. These distributions will be taxable to Unitholders in the calendar year
in which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which
the distributions are received.


If a Portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Portfolio
would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such
income were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of
earnings and profits would be taxable to Unitholders as ordinary dividend
income. There is no assurance that the distributions from your Portfolio will
be sufficient to eliminate all taxes in all years. A Portfolio may make taxable
distributions to you even during periods in which the share price has
declined.


Your Portfolio may be required to withhold as backup withholding federal
income tax at the backup withholding rate on all taxable distributions payable
to you if you fail to provide your correct taxpayer identification number or to
make required certifications, or if the IRS indicates that you are subject to
backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld may be credited against your federal income tax liability if you
provide the required information or certification.


If a Portfolio is treated as holding directly or indirectly 10 percent or
more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and
all U.S. shareholders collectively own more than 50 percent of the vote or
value of the stock of such corporation, the foreign corporation may be treated
as a "controlled foreign corporation" (a "CFC") for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In such circumstances, a Portfolio will be required to include
certain types of passive income and certain other types of income relating to
insurance, sales and services with related parties and oil related income in
the Portfolio's taxable income whether or not such income is distributed.


If a Portfolio holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold
at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income, the
Portfolio could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest
charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity
interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its
Unitholders. A Portfolio will not be able to pass through to its Unitholders
any credit or deduction for such taxes. A Portfolio may be able to make an
election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences. In this case, a
Portfolio would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such
PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it
did not exceed prior increases included in income. Under this election, a
Portfolio might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its
distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock
during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to the
distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4%
excise tax (described above). Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as
qualified dividend income.



PORTFOLIO TERMINATION



A Portfolio may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Portfolio then outstanding or by the
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by a Portfolio, as shown by any
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of a Portfolio has
exceeded $15,000,000). A Portfolio will be liquidated by the Trustee in the
event that a sufficient number of Units of such Portfolio not yet sold are
tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Portfolio
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time
they were deposited in such Portfolio. If a Portfolio is liquidated because of
the redemption of unsold Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each
purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust
Agreement will terminate upon the sale or other disposition of the last
Security held thereunder, but in no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory
Termination Date.


Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities will begin to be sold in
connection with the termination of the Portfolios. The Sponsor will determine
the manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor
shall direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate
orderly sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so
direct, the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such
manner as the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. Unitholders
will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities
within a reasonable time following the Mandatory Termination Date. The Trustee
will deduct from the funds of the appropriate Portfolio any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including
estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of liquidation and any amounts
required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other
governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in a Portfolio upon termination
may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were
not required at such time. The Trustee will then distribute to each Unitholder
of each Portfolio his pro rata share of the balance of the Income and Capital
Accounts of such Portfolio.


The Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a
subsequent series of the Portfolios. There is, however, no assurance that units
of any new series of the Portfolios will be offered for sale at that time, or
if offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the
requests of any or all Unitholders.


Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in
the same manner.

outstanding, transferred, liquidated, terminated, expire, and/or mature in
accordance with their respective terms, and Licensee may continue to use the
Index and Marks in connection with such outstanding Product(s) during such
post-termination period. Licensee shall cease all other use of the Index and the

Re:      Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1399 (the "Trust")




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel for Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. as depositor and
sponsor (the "Depositor") of the Trust in connection with the deposit of
securities therein pursuant to the Indenture referred to below, by which the
Trust was created and under which the units of fractional undivided interest
(collectively, the "Units") have been issued. Pursuant to the Indenture, the
Depositor has transferred to the Trust either cash together with instructions
for the Trustee to purchase certain securities, or certain securities and
contracts or delivery statements relating to contracts to purchase certain
securities together with irrevocable letters of credit to be held by the Trustee
upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. (All securities to be
acquired by the Trust are collectively referred to as the "Securities.")


In connection with our representation, we have examined the originals or
certified copies of the following documents relating to the creation of the
Trust, the deposit of the Securities and the issuance and sale of the Units: (a)
the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust For Invesco Unit Trusts, Effective
for Unit Investment Trusts Established On and After December 6, 2012 (Including
Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1281 and Subsequent Series), and the Trust Agreement
of even date herewith relating to the Trust (collectively, the "Indenture")
among the Depositor, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as supervisor, and The
Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"); (b) the Closing Memorandum
relating to the deposit of the Securities in the Trust, which includes
certification by an authorized officer of the Depositor with respect to certain
factual matters contained therein ("Officer's Certification"); (c) the
Notification of Registration on Form N-8A and the Registration Statements on
Form N-8B-2, as amended, relating to the Trust, as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"); (d) the Registration Statement on Form S 6
(Registration No. 333-192704) filed with the Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and all Amendments thereto
(said Registration Statement, as amended by said Amendment(s) being herein
called the "Registration Statement"); (e) the proposed form of final prospectus
(the "Prospectus") relating to the Units, which is expected to be filed with the
Commission this day; (f) the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Depositor, as amended, each certified to by an authorized officer of the
Depositor; and (g) certificates or telegrams of public officials as to matters
set forth upon therein.


We have assumed the genuineness of all agreements, instruments and documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to originals of all copies
thereof submitted to us. We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures
and the legal capacity of all persons executing agreements, instruments and
documents examined or relied upon by us.


Where matters are stated to be "to the best of our knowledge" or "known to us,"
our knowledge is limited to the actual knowledge of those attorneys in our
office who have performed services for the Trust, their review of documents
provided to us by the Depositor in connection with this engagement and inquiries
of officers of the Depositor, the results of which are reflected in the
Officer's Certification. We have not independently verified the accuracy of the
matters set forth in the written statements or certificates upon which we have
relied. We have not reviewed the financial statements, compilation of the
Securities held by the Trust, or other financial or statistical data contained
in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as to which we understand you
have been furnished with the reports of the accountants appearing in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus. In addition, we have made no specific
inquiry as to whether any stop order or investigatory proceedings have been
commenced with respect to the Registration Statement or the Depositor nor have
we reviewed court or governmental agency dockets.


Statements in this opinion as to the validity, binding effect and enforceability
of agreements, instruments and documents are subject: (i) to limitations as to
enforceability imposed by bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, insolvency and
other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights, and (ii) to limitations under equitable principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies.


We are not admitted to the practice of law in any jurisdiction but the State of
New York and we do not hold ourselves out as experts in or express any opinion
as to the laws of other states or jurisdictions except as to matters of federal
law. No opinion is expressed as to the effect that the law of any other
jurisdiction might have upon the subject matter of the opinions expressed herein
under applicable conflicts of law principles, rules or regulations or otherwise.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


(1) The Indenture has been duly authorized and executed and delivered by an
authorized officer of the Depositor and is a valid and binding obligation of the
Depositor in accordance with its terms.


(2) The registration of Units on the registration books of the Trust by the
Trustee has been duly authorized by the Depositor in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture and issued for the consideration contemplated
therein, the Units will constitute fractional undivided interests in the Trust,
will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and will conform in all
material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus. Upon
payment of the consideration for the Units as provided in the Indenture and the
Registration Statement, the Units will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable by the Trust.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Registration Statement
and in the related Prospectus. This opinion is intended solely for the benefit
of the addressee in connection with the issuance of the Units of the Trust and
may not be relied upon in any other manner or by any other person without our
express written consent.


Very truly yours,

Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1399

2 Hanson Place

12th Floor

Brooklyn, NY 11217


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We are acting as your counsel in connection with the execution and delivery by
you of a certain trust agreement, dated as of today (the "Indenture"), among
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as depositor (the "Depositor"), Invesco
Investment Advisers LLC, as supervisor (the "Supervisor"), and you, as Trustee,
establishing Invesco Unit Trusts, Series 1399 (the "Fund"), consisting of
Dividend Sustainability Portfolio 2014-1, International Dividend Sustainability
Portfolio 2014-1 and European Dividend Sustainability Portfolio 2014-1 (each, a
"Trust" and collectively, the "Trusts"), and the registration by you, as Trustee
on the registration books of each Trust, of ownership of all of the units of
fractional undivided interests ("Units") in the Trusts, as set forth in the
prospectus, dated today, for filing as an amendment to the registration
statement heretofore filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (respectively the "Prospectus" and the
"Registration Statement"), relating to the Fund (File Number 333-192704). Each
Trust consists of the securities set forth in the Prospectus (including delivery
statements relating to contracts for the purchase of certain securities not yet
delivered and cash, cash equivalents, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a
combination thereof, in the amount required to pay for such purchase upon the
receipt of such securities) defined in the Indenture as "Securities" and listed
in Schedule A to the Indenture (such securities, delivery statements and cash,
cash equivalents or letter of credit being herein called the "Underlying
Securities").


We have examined the Indenture and originals (or copies certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments, certificates and
documents, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of
rendering this opinion letter. In such examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to this opinion letter, we
have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the
aforesaid instruments, certificates and documents.


Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1.   The Bank of New York Mellon is a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of New York with the powers of a trust company under the Banking
Law of the State of New York.


2.   The execution of the Indenture is within the authorization of the executing
officers of The Bank of New York Mellon.


3.   The Indenture is in proper form for execution and delivery by you as
Trustee.


4.   Upon receipt by you of the Underlying Securities you may properly register
the units on the registration books of each Trust in the name of Cede &
Co., as nominee of Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Upon receipt of advice
of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, you may cause the Units
to be credited to, or upon the order of, the Depositor, as provided in the
Closing Memorandum being executed and delivered today by the parties to the
Indenture.


5.   You as Trustee may lawfully, under the Banking Law of the State of New
York, advance to a Trust such amounts as may be necessary to provide
periodic distributions or payment of expenses for a Trust, and be
reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the income
or capital account for a Trust on the ensuing record date or as otherwise
provided in the Indenture.


In rendering the foregoing opinions we have not considered, among other things,
the merchantability of the Underlying Securities, whether the Underlying
Securities have been duly authorized and delivered and are fully paid for and
non-assessable or the tax status of the Underlying Securities under any federal,
state or local laws.


The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York and the
federal laws of the United States of America.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name and the reference to our firm
in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus.

IM-IT 663



Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 663 invests in a portfolio of

Monthly

Distributions




Estimated Current Return:       3.78%
Estimated Long Term Return:     2.92%


Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated
return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the
opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base
this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This
estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the
average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value
and estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return
accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates
show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation
can predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these
estimates.

INVESCO



Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income
and to preserve capital.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of municipal
bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States,
and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is,
in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities,
excludable from gross income for federal personal income tax purposes under
existing law. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all
principal and interest on the bonds in the Trust has been previously obtained
from bond insurance companies. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor
considered the following factors, among others:


o    the bonds must be insured with a Standard & Poor's rating of at least
"A-" or a Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of at least "A3", or
if not rated as of the Date of Deposit are insured by a bond insurer
with at least a "A-" rating by Standard & Poor's or at least a "A3"
rating by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;


o    the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality
and maturity;


o    the current income provided by the bonds;


o    the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; and


o    the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk.


The portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately 15 to 40
years from the Date of Deposit. Following the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease
to be rated or its rating may be reduced and the Trust could continue to hold
such bond. See "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration" in Prospectus


Part II.


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can
happen for reasons such as these:


o    Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over
time.


o    The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in
general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or
fall in the future.


o    A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or
principal payments in the future.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering
period.


o    A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated
maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to
you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price
could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond. If enough
bonds are called, the Trust could terminate earlier than expected.


o    The Trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer.
This makes the Trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than
a more diversified portfolio. The types of bonds in the portfolio are
listed under "The Bonds" in Prospectus Part II.


o    We do not actively manage the Trust's portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market
value declines.

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot
guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.


(2)  During the initial offering period, part of the value of the Units
represents an amount of cash deposited to pay all or a portion of the costs
of organizing the Trust. The estimated organization costs per Unit will be
deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of six months after
the Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period. If Units are
redeemed prior to any such reduction, these costs will not be deducted from
the redemption proceeds. Organization costs are not included in the Public
Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge.


(3)  After the first settlement date (April 30, 2013), you will pay accrued
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest
distributions.


(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than organization
costs. Organization costs are not deducted from interest income.


(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.


(6)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.

For an explanation of the footnotes used on this page, see "Notes to Portfolio".



Notes to Portfolio



(1)  The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for
the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from April 8, 2013 to
April 25, 2013.


(2)  The Offering Price to Trust of the bonds is based on the offering side
valuation as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit determined
by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider, on the basis set forth
under "Public Offering--Unit Price" in Prospectus Part II. In accordance
with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures, the Trust's investments are classified as
Level 2, which refers to security prices determined using other significant
observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market
participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted
market prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and
credit risk. The cost of the bonds to the Sponsor for the Trust is
$8,412,355 and the Sponsor's profit or (loss) is $97,246.


The breakdown of the preinsured bond insurers is as follows: Assured
Municipal 81%, Assured Guaranty 3% and Berkshire Hathaway Assurance 3% and
Build America Mutual Assurance 13%.


The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the
corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is
included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the
maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed
delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of
Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to
take place at various dates after the first settlement date.


"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an
original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part

II. The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is
described in "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.


(3)  All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"
indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief
description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.


(4)  This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at
declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
subsequent years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with
respect to an issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption
without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in
Prospectus Part II.


Federal Tax Status--Exchange Option. The following sentence is added
immediately the first sentence under "Federal Tax Status--Exchange Option" in
Prospectus Part II:


"An exchange does not avoid a taxable disposition of your redeemed Units."


Federal Tax Status--Distributions. In both the second and third paragraphs
under "Federal Tax Status--Distributions" in Prospectus Part II, references to
"15%" are replaced with "20%".


The eleventh paragraph under "Federal Tax Status--Distributions" in
Prospectus Part II is replaced with the following:


"If a Trust declares dividends in October, November or December that are
payable to Unitholders of record on a date during those months, Unitholders
must take the dividends into account for tax purposes in the year the dividend
was declared, if the dividend is paid either in the year declared or in January
of the following year."


The last sentence of the fourteenth paragraph under "Federal Tax
Status--Distributions" in Prospectus Part II is replaced with the following:


"Distributions by a Trust reduce the net asset value of such Trust's Units,
and if a distribution reduces the net asset value below a Unitholder's cost
basis, such distribution, nevertheless, could be taxable to the Unitholder as
ordinary income or capital gain as described above, even though, from an
economic standpoint, it may constitute a partial return of capital."


Federal Tax Status--Sale or Redemption of Units. The third sentence under
"Federal Tax Status--Sale or Redemption of Units" in Prospectus Part II is
replaced with the following:


"Non-corporate Unitholders are currently subject to tax at a maximum federal
rate of 20% on capital gains resulting from the disposition of Units held for
more than 12 months (zero if the taxpayer is, and would be after accounting for
such gains, subject to a federal tax bracket for ordinary income of 25% or
less)."


Insurance on the Bonds. Any downgrade in the rating of an insurer of the
bonds in the Trust may result in a downgrade in the rating of the issuer of the
related bond and therefore may have a material adverse effect on the value of
the bonds in the Trust and the value of your Units. The following is a
description of the various bond insurers:


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). On December
15, 2008, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") withdrew the financial
strength, financial enhancement, and issuer credit ratings of ACA Financial
Guaranty.


Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac"). On November 8, 2010, Ambac Financial
Group, Inc., the holding company of Ambac, announced that it has filed for a
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac Financial Group,
Inc. will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business as
"debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders
of the Bankruptcy Court.


On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")
withdrew the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance, Inc.
("FSA")). On July 1, 2009, Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"), the parent
company of Assured Guaranty, completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed "Assured Municipal." In
certain states, Assured Municipal may operate under its prior name. Assured
Municipal, a separately capitalized company, provides municipal bond insurance,
while Assured Guaranty provides financial guaranty insurance to both the
municipal and structured finance sectors.


On November 30, 2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial
strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from
AA+, with a stable outlook. The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view
that Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to
mitigate the largest obligor concentrations for a higher rating. On January 17,
2013, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of Assured
Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a
stable outlook. The January 17, 2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of
the business franchise, expected future profitability and financial flexibility
of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal.


Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). On July 23, 2012, S&P
assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial strength and counterparty
credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings based upon S&P's view that
BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low industry risk, along with
extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating performance.


Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp. ("BHAC"). On April 8, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1,
with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects Moody's view concerning "the
impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe decline in equity markets
over the past year as well as the protracted economic recession." On February
4, 2010, S&P lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+,
with a stable outlook, reflecting S&P's view that Berkshire's overall capital
adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA rating and is
not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near term.


CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). On November 11, 2009, Moody's
announced that it will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). On March 24, 2009, Moody's
withdrew the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009,
S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of FGIC.


On November 24, 2009, FGIC announced that pursuant to an order of the New
York Insurance Department, the company must suspend any and all claims payments
until it has removed the impairment of its capital and restored to compliance
its minimum surplus to policyholders requirement.


National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). On February 18,
2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA
Corp."), announced the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance
operations following the approval of the New York and Illinois insurance
regulators. The restructuring involves the segregation of its financial
guaranty insurance operations into two separately capitalized sister companies,
with MBIA Illinois assuming the risk associated with its US municipal
exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring the remainder of the portfolio,
including all international and structured finance exposures. Business recently
ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC has been assigned to MBIA Illinois. On March 19,
2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National Public Finance
Guarantee Corporation. National Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA,
Inc. and independently capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources
as of December 31, 2010. In certain states, National Guarantee may operate
under its prior name.


On July 24, 2009, Moody's confirmed National Guarantee's insurance financial
strength rating of Baa1, with a developing outlook. On December 22, 2010, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook.


Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). On November 10, 2010, Moody's
confirmed Radian's Ba1 insurance financial strength rating, with a stable
outlook. On December 23, 2010, S&P confirmed Radian's BB- financial strength,
financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings, with a negative outlook.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial
strength rating of Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing
outlook. On July 28, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength and financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee.

following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal
underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" in

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



To the Unitholders of Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 663 (included
in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1148):


We have audited the accompanying statement of condition including the
related portfolio of Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 663 (included in
Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1148) as of April 25, 2013. The statement
of condition is the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the statement of condition is free of material misstatement. The Trust is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the statement of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall
statement of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with
The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of
credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of
condition as of April 25, 2013. We believe that our audit of the statement of
condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Insured Municipals
Income Trust, Series 663 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series
1148) as of April 25, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

---------------------








(1)  The value of the bonds is determined by Standard & Poor's Securities
Evaluations, Inc. on the bases set forth under "Public Offering--Unit
Price" in Prospectus Part II. The contracts to purchase bonds are
collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient
to satisfy such contracts.


(2)  The Trustee will advance the amount of the net interest accrued to the
first settlement date to the Trust for distribution to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of such date.


(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount of cash
sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in
establishing the Trust. The amount of these costs are set forth under
"Summary of Essential Financial Information--Expenses". A distribution will
be made as of the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the
close of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the
Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of the investors
will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the
Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated
organization costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to
the Sponsor and deducted from the net assets of the Trust.

THE TRUSTS





General. Your Trust is one of several unit investment trusts created under
the name Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series. The Trusts were created under
the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement
(the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of Prospectus Part I (the "Date of
Deposit") among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (formerly Van Kampen Funds Inc.)
as Sponsor, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as
Trustee.


The Trusts are separate portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by
or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and political
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion
of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable from gross
income for Federal income tax purposes under existing law. All issuers of bonds
in a "State Trust" are located in the state for which the Trust is named or in
United States territories or possessions and their public authorities;
consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the bond issuers, the
interest earned on the bonds is exempt to the extent indicated in Prospectus
Part I from state and local taxes. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to
the respective issuers, the interest income of each bond in a U.S. Territorial
IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and local income
taxation. With the exception of Kansas, Missouri, New York and Pennsylvania
Trusts, Units of a State Trust may be purchased only by residents of the state
for which the Trust is named. Units of a Kansas Trust may be purchased by
residents of Kansas and Missouri. Units of a Missouri Trust may be purchased by
residents of Missouri and Kansas. Units of a New York Trust may be purchased by
residents of New York, Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey. Units of a
Pennsylvania Trust may be purchased by residents of Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and West Virginia. Trusts that
hold only insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". "Long-Term
Trust" refers to IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, High
Grade Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, Long-Term State and National Quality
Trusts. "Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate Trust" refers to an Investment
Grade Municipal Trust which is designated as an "intermediate series" in the
name of such Trust. "IGMT 3-7 Year Series" refers to an Investment Grade
Municipal Trust which is designated as a "3-7 year series" in the name of such
Trust. "Intermediate-Term Trust" refers to Strategic Municipal Trust
Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Trusts, Investment Grade Municipal
Intermediate Trusts and State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts. Trusts that
are named for a particular state are referred to herein as "State Trusts".
"State Intermediate Trust" refers to a State Trust which is designated as an
"intermediate series" in the name of such Trust. "State Intermediate Laddered
Maturity Trust" refers to a State Trust which is designated as an "intermediate
laddered maturity series" in the name of such Trust. State Trusts, other than
State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or State Intermediate Trusts, are
referred to herein as "Long-Term State Trusts". "Investment Grade Municipal
Limited Maturity Trust" refers to an Investment Grade Municipal Trust which is
designated as a "limited maturity series" in the name of such Trust.


On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate
principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds in a Trust initially consist of
delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash
equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial
institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds in a Trust,
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I.


The following table sets forth the approximate range of maturities in years
from the Date of Deposit for bonds held in the indicated Trusts:








                                                                             Approximate Maturity
                                                                             From Date of Deposit
Trust                                                                              in Years
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount, U.S. Territorial IM-IT,
    Long-Term State and National Quality Trust...............................      15 to 40
High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond Trust, 20+ Year Series............................      20 to 30
IM-IT Laddered Series........................................................      10 to 30
Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust............................      17 to 22
IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust and Quality Municipals Income Trust (QM-IT)
    Limited Maturity Series..................................................      12 to 15
Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate Trust................................       7 to 13
IM-IT Intermediate Trust and Strategic Municipal Trust Intermediate Series...       5 to 15
State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust...................................       5 to 10
IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust and IGMT 3-7 Year Series......................       3 to 7








The portfolio of any IM-IT Laddered Series is generally structured so that
approximately 20% of the bonds will mature every five years, beginning in
approximately the tenth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to return
of principal. The portfolio of any State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust
is generally structured so that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature each
year, beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust, entitling each
Unitholder to a return of principal. This return of principal may offer
Unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to
specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of the scheduled
maturities. However, the flexibility provided by the return of principal may
also eliminate a Unitholder's ability to reinvest at a rate as high as the
yield on the bonds which matured.


Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


Objectives and Bond Selection. The Trusts seek to preserve capital and to
provide federal tax-exempt income and, in the case of most State Trusts,
Federal and state tax-exempt income taxation. The Trusts invest in portfolios
of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the
United States, and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest
on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing
authorities, excludable from gross income for federal and, for State Trusts,
state personal income tax purposes under existing law. An IM-IT Laddered Series
has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest
rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio
of interest-bearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 10
to 30 years in which roughly 20% of the bonds mature every five years beginning
in approximately the tenth year of the Trust. A State Intermediate Laddered
Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing protection against
changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a
laddered portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations with
maturities ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which roughly 20% of the
bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust.
There is, of course, no guarantee that any Trust will achieve its objectives. A
Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to
participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income bonds with greater
diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.

Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always
inherent in the ownership of bonds. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment,
when due, of all principal and interest on the bonds in each Insured Trust has
been obtained from municipal bond insurance companies. For information relating
to insurance on the bonds, see "Insurance on the Bonds in the Insured Trusts".


In selecting bonds for a Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors,
among others: (a) as of the Date of Deposit, the bonds are rated by at least one
nationally recognized statistical rating organization in the category described
in Prospectus Part I for the particular Trust or, if not rated, have credit
characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so
rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by such Trust in the opinion of the
Sponsor, (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable
quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds, (d) the
diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and (e)
the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After
the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced
below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires
elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor's
determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond
(see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration").


The Bonds. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States, municipalities and
public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes.
In selecting bonds, the Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by type of
bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you
better understand your investment. The types of bonds and percentages they
represent in your portfolio are listed in Prospectus Part I. These bonds are
also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.


General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. General obligation bonds are
backed by the general taxing power of the issuer. The issuer secures these
bonds by pledging its faith, credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment
of principal and interest. All other bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of
subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" and notes
thereto in Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics
of the bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.


Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par
value.


"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even
though your Trust has not yet received them.


In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to
the First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts
necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become
available from interest payments on the related bonds. Also, since interest on
any "when, as and if issued" bonds does not begin accruing as tax-exempt
interest income to the benefit of Unitholders until the date of delivery, the
Trustee may reduce its fee and pay Trust expenses in order to maintain or
approach the same estimated net annual interest income during the first year of
the Trust's operations as described under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I.


Municipal Bond Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section
describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You
should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds
falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing
in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or
that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information
Supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your
investment.


Current economic conditions. The markets for credit instruments, including
corporate bonds and municipal securities, have experienced periods of extreme
illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of 2007. The current economic
environment has made conditions difficult for virtually all industries and
companies to operate in an efficient manner. General market uncertainty and
consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers,
which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety
of debt securities. These conditions resulted, and in many cases continue to
result in, greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a
lack of price transparency, with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of
uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of some of the
Trust's bonds uncertain and/or result in sudden and significant valuation
increases or declines in its holdings.


Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a
managed fund.


Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity
are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.


Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.


Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the
original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price
could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below
the bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount
you paid for your Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust
could terminate early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond is
listed in the "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer
would have to pay. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such
as certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire
or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used,
and various other events. The call provisions are described in general terms in
the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section in Prospectus Part
I, and the notes thereto. Additional discussion of call provisions appears in
the Information Supplement.


Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described under
"The Bonds".


Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.


Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond
both default in making their payment obligations.


Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading
market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).


Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. For example, future
legislation could reduce tax rates, impose a flat tax, exempt all investment
income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds. Litigation could
challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.


State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in tax-exempt
municipal bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of
a state may be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain
the revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their
obligations.


The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with
exports and industry deregulation.


A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.



ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS





The Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term Return as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Part I. Estimated
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the Trust and
with the principal prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange
or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price
of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated
Current Return will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines
and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which
takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts)
and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses
and sales charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated
retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, there is no
assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the
future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds
while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual
interest income and Public Offering Price.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the
Principal Account (including cash to pay organization costs) and accrued
interest, if any. Organization costs are not included in the Public Offering
Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge.


If you purchase Units during the initial offering period of a Trust with a
deferred sales charge, your sales charge will consist of (i) an initial sales
charge paid upon the purchase of your Units and (ii) the remaining deferred
sales charge, which consists of a fixed dollar amount per Unit paid in
installments on specified deferred sales charge payment dates. In no event will
your combined initial sales charge and deferred sales charge exceed the maximum
percentage sales charge for the applicable Trust as set forth above. For more
details, including the specific amount and method of calculation of the initial
and deferred sales charge, for those Trusts which offer a deferred sales
charge, see the "Fee Table" in Prospectus Part I of the applicable Trust.


After the initial public offering period, the secondary market Public
Offering Price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales charge
described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account and accrued interest,
if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.
The minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one Unit. Certain
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing
Unit purchases.


The maximum initial offering period sales charges are as follows:








                                                                            Initial Offering Period Sales Charge
                                                                                         as Percent of

The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR
Life") of a Trust's portfolio:








 ELTR Life (Years)    Sales Charge    ELTR Life (Years)     Sales Charge    ELTR Life (Years)     Sales Charge
------------------    ------------   -------------------    ------------   -------------------    ------------
Less than 2 .........    1.00%      8 but less than 9 .....    3.50%      15 but less than 16 ...    4.80%
2 but less than 3 ...    1.50       9 but less than 10 ....    4.00       16 but less than 17 ...    4.90
3 but less than 4 ...    2.00       10 but less than 11 ...    4.20       17 but less than 18 ...    5.00

7 but less than 8 ...    3.00       14 but less than 15 ...    4.70       21 and over ...........    5.40








The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a
Trust with an ELTR Life of "9 but less than 10" years would be 4.00% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit (4.167% of the aggregate bid price of the
bonds).


If you purchase Units in the secondary market of a Trust with a deferred
sales charge, your maximum sales charge will be based on the remaining ELTR
Life of the Trust as described above and will consist of an initial sales
charge and the remaining deferred sales charge, if any. If the secondary market
Units are purchased prior to the final deferred sales charge payment date, the
initial sales charge, which you pay at the time of purchase, is the difference
between the secondary market sales charge based on the ELTR Life listed above
and the maximum remaining deferred sales charge. If you purchase Units after
the last deferred sales charge payment has been assessed, your maximum sales
charge will consist of the one time initial sales charge based on the ELTR
Life.


Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for
a reduced sales charge. You may not combine discounts.


For Trusts with a deferred sales charge, these charges are fixed dollar
amounts per Unit, and your Trust must charge these amounts per Unit regardless
of any discounts. However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that
your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred
sales charges, you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your
total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy Units.


Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. If you purchase the amount of Units shown in the table
below during the initial offering period, your sales charge will be as
follows:








                                                Sales Charge Reduction Per Unit
                          ------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------        ----------------  ------------  ------------  ------------  ------------
100 - 249 Units.........    $      4.00     $     2.00    $     2.50    $     4.00    $    4.00
250 - 499 Units.........    $      6.00     $     3.00    $     3.50    $     6.00    $    6.00

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to
purchases of a single Trust made by the same person on a single day from a
single broker-dealer. We also apply the different purchase levels on a dollar
basis using a $1,000 Unit equivalent. For example, if you purchase between
$250,000 and $499,999, your sales charge discount per Unit for an IM-IT will
be $6.


Aggregated Purchases--For purposes of achieving these levels you may combine
purchases of Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus with purchases of units
of any other Invesco-sponsored unit investment trusts in the initial offering
period (including other Trusts offered in this prospectus) which are not already
subject to a reduced sales charge. In addition, Units purchased in the name of
your spouse or children under 21 living in the same household as you will be
deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the
applicable quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also be
applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust,
estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or fiduciary
account. To be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph, all
purchases must be made on the same day through a single broker-dealer or selling
agent. You must inform your broker-dealer of any combined purchases before your
purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge.


Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to
the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer
to the section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these
purchases. Units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the Public
Offering Price less the maximum applicable concession the Sponsor typically
allows to brokers and dealers (either non-Underwriter or Underwriter
concession, whichever is greater) for purchases by investors who purchase Units
through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and
registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management
services, or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an
investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is
imposed ("Fee Accounts") if the Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the
Trust is subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). For
example, with respect to a Long-Term Trust such as IM-IT, Wrap Fee Eligible
purchasers would pay $9 per Unit, which represents the maximum sales charge of
$49 per Unit minus the maximum applicable concession of $40 per Unit. The
Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in
this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is
determined to be detrimental to a Trust.


Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus at a reduced
sales charge. The sales charge will be reduced by $14.00 per Unit for IM-IT,
Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, High Grade
Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, Long-Term State and National Quality Trusts,
by $9.00 per Unit for IM-IT Limited Maturity, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series,
Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts, IM-IT Laddered Series and
Intermediate-Term Trusts and by $4.50 per Unit for IGMT 3-7 Year Series. In
order to be eligible for the sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases
made with redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts,
the termination or redemption proceeds used to purchase Units of the Trust must
be derived from a transaction that occurred within 30 days of your Unit
purchase. In addition, the discounts will only be available for investors that
utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate
notification) for both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the
receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase.
You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to
your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge
discounts. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on the redemption or
termination of an interest in a Trust.


Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as
"related purchasers")) of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. and its affiliates and,
when permitted, Underwriters and their affiliates may purchase Units at the
Public Offering Price less the applicable underwriting commission or less the
applicable dealer concession in the absence of an underwriting commission.
Employees, officers and directors (including related purchasers) of dealers and
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the
applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies
of the related selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies
that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are
eligible for the discounts.


Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units
as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding
the applicable sales charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering
price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. This
price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared
by the Evaluator. During the initial offering period, the Evaluator will value
the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on days the New York Stock Exchange is open
for business and will adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. The
"Evaluation Time" is the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
on each day that the Exchange is open for trading, or earlier on days where the
Bond Market Association recommends an early bond market close, provided,
however, on the Date of Deposit the "Evaluation Time" will be the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") becomes
effective, if later. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be
equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary
market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For
secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of
the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption
and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to range
approximately from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price.


The Public Offering Price per Unit will be effective for all orders received
prior to the Evaluation Time on each business day. Orders received by the
Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders received by authorized
financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are properly
transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced
based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after the
Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial professionals
after the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not
transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are
priced based on the date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit
provided they are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders
received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.


The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or
offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to
those held by the Trusts; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis
of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest
rates.


A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


Organization Costs. During the initial offering period, part of the Public
Offering Price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated
costs incurred in establishing your Trust. These costs include the costs of
preparing documents relating to the Trust (such as the registration statement,
prospectus, trust agreement and legal documents), federal and state
registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and the initial
audit. Your Trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial
offering period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will
decline when the Trust deducts these costs from the Trust assets.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although each
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of
interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate
share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering
Price of Units. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the
amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders.
If you sell or redeem all or a portion of your Units, you will be entitled to
receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of
your Units.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission
described in the following sections.


IGMT 3-7 Year Series. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor will
sell Units of IGMT 3-7 Year Series to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and
selling agents at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount)
less the gross concession or agency commission set forth in the following
table.

For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $8 per Unit for
an IGMT 3-7 Year Series.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the

Intermediate-Term Trusts. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor
will sell Units of Intermediate-Term Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers

discount) less the gross concession or agency commission set forth in the
following table.

For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $15 per Unit for
an Intermediate-Term Trust.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.

QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity
Trusts, or IM-IT Limited Maturity Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and
selling agents at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount)

investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of an IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment
Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust, or IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, the
regular concession or agency commission allowed by the Sponsor to
broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $22 per Unit for the Trust.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.


Long-Term and IM-IT Discount Trusts. During the initial offering period, the
Sponsor will sell Units of Long-Term and IM-IT Discount Trusts to
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price
(net of any sales charge discount) less the gross concession or agency
commission set forth in the following table.








                          Concession

For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for
a Long-Term Trust.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.


General. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions above are also
applied on a dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit
and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The
breakpoints above will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders
stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement
that only whole Units be issued.


Notwithstanding the preceding tables, non-Underwriter broker-dealers and
other selling agents that purchase 250 or more Units of a Trust from the Sponsor
on the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a
concession or agency commission on such Units equal to the regular concession
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"
below. In addition, Qualifying Broker-Dealers will be allowed a concession or
agency commission equal to the dollar amount of the first level of underwriter
concession set forth for the appropriate Trust under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation" below (for example $31 per Unit for an IM-IT Laddered Series or
$35 per Unit for a Long-Term Trust) on subsequent Unit purchases from the
Sponsor throughout the remainder of the initial offering period of a Trust,
provided, however, that a Qualifying Broker-Dealer will be allowed a concession
or agency commission equal to the concession or agency commission allowed to
such firm on the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single day equal
to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if the
Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the number
of Units of a Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.


In addition to the concession or agency commission and rebates described in
the sections above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms (including
Underwriters) will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all eligible Invesco unit investment trusts
during a Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:








                                      Additional
Initial Offering Period Sales           Volume
During Quarterly Period               Concession
------------------------------------  ----------
$2 million but less than $5 million     0.025%
$5 million but less than $10 million    0.050
$10 million but less than $50 million   0.075
$50 million or more                     0.100








"Quarterly Period" means the following periods: January -- March; April --
June; July -- September; and October --December. Broker-dealers and other
selling firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale
of units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in
applicable prospectuses), however, such sales will be included in determining
whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set forth in the table
above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for
purposes of these volume concessions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wells
Fargo Advisors will receive the maximum volume concession set forth in the
table above for all eligible unit sales. The Sponsor will pay these amounts out
of the sales charge received on units within a reasonable time following each
Quarterly Period. For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation
for Quarterly Period sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure
related to this additional compensation; a trust is not eligible for this
additional compensation if the prospectus for such trust does not include
disclosure related to this additional compensation. The Investment Grade
Municipal Intermediate Trusts and the Investment Grade Municipal Limited
Maturity Trusts will not be eligible for the Additional Volume Concession
described above.


Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on
an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal
to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer
or agent. For secondary market transactions, the Sponsor will sell Units to
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a
concession or agency commission of 80% of the applicable sales charge. Dealers
other than the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary market to other
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a
concession or agency commission not in excess of the secondary market
concession allowed to the dealer. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in
whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount
of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others from time to
time.


Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will sell Units to
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross
concession described in the sections below. For a list of the Underwriters that
have purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.


IGMT 3-7 Year Series. The Sponsor will sell Units of IGMT 3-7 Year Series to
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a concession of
$12 per Unit underwritten.


If a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for an IGMT 3-7 Year Series, the
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on
all Units of such Trust distributed during the initial offering period and
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions
described under "Unit Distribution".


Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in an IGMT 3-7 Year
Series will receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $0.50 for each
Unit it underwrites.


Intermediate Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Intermediate-Term
Trusts to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the
concession per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.








                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
100 Units - 999 Units         $22.00
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units      23.00
3,000 Units or more            23.50










IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment Grade
Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts and IM-IT Limited Maturity Trusts. The
Sponsor will sell Units of IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity
Series, Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts or IM-IT Limited
Maturity Trusts to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit
less the concession per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.






                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
250 Units - 999 Units         $31
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units      32
3,000 Units or more            33








IM-IT Discount Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of IM-IT Discount Trusts
to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the
concession per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.








                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
Less than 500 Units           $35
500 Units - 999 Units          36
1,000 Units or more            37








Long-Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Long-Term Trusts to
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession
per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.








                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
250 - 500 Units               $35
500 Units - 999 Units          36
1,000 Units - 1,999 Units      37
2,000 Units - 2,999 Units      38
3,000 Units or more            40








General. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar basis
utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on
whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be
issued.


An Underwriter will be allowed a concession equal to the Underwriter
concession allowed to such firm on the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases
on a single day equal to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all
remaining Units if the Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units available for
sale) or (b) the number of Units of a Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.


In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters
are eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and
agents, and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the
related broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the
regular Underwriter concession.


In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of Trusts and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisers for past
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisers, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of Trusts and our other products. Fees may include
payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection with
trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars of a
business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your
Units.


Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges
payable out of the Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. With respect to Units of
Trusts with a deferred sales charge, any such Units sold prior to the time the
entire deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed the amount of
any remaining deferred sales charge at the time of sale. The Trustee will notify
the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.



FEE ACCOUNTS





As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Trust is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your financial
professional to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these
purchases you generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is
retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. You should
consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section for specific
information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section governs the
calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the right to
limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or selling firms
whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a Trust.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly. The amount and time of
the first distribution is described in Prospectus Part I under "Summary of
Essential Financial Information". In addition, a Trust that has elected to be
structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes may
make additional required distributions at the end of each year.


Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits
from the use of these funds). Should the amount available for distribution in
the Principal Account equal or exceed $5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a
distribution from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date
to Unitholders of record on the related monthly record date. However, funds in
the Principal Account will be distributed on the last distribution date of each
calendar year to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date if the
amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.


Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on
the second distribution date after the purchase.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three business
days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an amount for
each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by
the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the
date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as regards Units
received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange is open and
the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on that day for
redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received by authorized
financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are properly
transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are priced
based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee after
the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized financial
professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such
persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated
by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption
price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption
requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely
manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee
for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee
are not subject to such fees.


Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".


The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, (iii) accrued interest, less (a)
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges, (b) the accrued Trust
expenses and (c) for Trusts with a deferred sales charge, any unpaid deferred
sales charge payments. During the initial offering period, the Redemption Price
and secondary market repurchase price are not reduced by estimated organization
costs. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Unit Price". Accrued interest paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.


The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust will be reduced. Sales may
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of 1,000 or more
Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in an in kind
distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution of bonds will be made by the
Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in
book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository
Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a
Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole
bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in kind
distribution.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of each Trust will be
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account
or your Trust, please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS





Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in each Insured Trust. The premium
for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid by the issuer, by a prior owner
of the bonds and any policy is non-cancelable and will continue in force so long
as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the preinsured bond insurer remains
in business. The preinsured bond insurers are described in "Portfolio" and the
notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed information regarding
insurance on the bonds and the preinsured bond insurers is included in the
Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".


Each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the
state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation, however, is no
guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on its contract of
insurance in the event a claim should be made. The financial information with
respect to each insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance
regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities.
No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such
information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such
information subsequent to the dates thereof.



TRUST ADMINISTRATION





Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net
worth clients around the globe. On June 1, 2010, Invesco Ltd. acquired the
retail asset management business, including Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (then
known as Van Kampen Funds Inc.), from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. The
Sponsor's principal office is located at 11 Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas
77046-1173. As of September 30, 2012, the total stockholders' equity of Invesco
Capital Markets, Inc. was $95,560,974 (unaudited). The current assets under
management and supervision by Invesco Ltd. and its affiliates were valued at
approximately $683.0 billion as of September 30, 2012.


The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional information about
the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have any questions
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial advisor. The
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding
the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the
Trustee. See "Additional Information".


Portfolio Administration. The Trusts are not managed funds and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited
situations to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds
or other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of
certain legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated
by the Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trustee will generally reject any offer by an issuer to
issue bonds in exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or
refinancing plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange
or substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed
description of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See
"Additional Information".


If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must
be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds in terms of (i) the exemption
from federal and state taxation, (ii) maturity, (iii) yield to maturity and
current return, (iv) Standard & Poor's or Moody's ratings, and (v) insurance in
an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust within
five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed Bond
exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds
are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to the
Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and distribute the principal and
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of removal
from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal.
All interest paid to a Unitholder which accrued after the expected date of
settlement for Units will be paid by the Sponsor and accordingly will not be
treated as tax-exempt income. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.


Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the
Sponsor and the Trustee) or to maintain the tax status of a Trust. The Trust
Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or to permit the
acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds
initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution of certain refunding
bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are
tendered for redemption by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the
net worth of such Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial
principal amount of such Trust. If a Trust is liquidated because of the
redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriter, the Sponsor will refund to each
purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trustee
will notify each Unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and
will then liquidate any remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not
required at that time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a
Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per
Unit or value at the time of purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts
after deduction of costs, expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive
a final distribution statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its
sole discretion determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer
necessary, it will distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information
Supplement contains further information regarding termination of a Trust. See
"Additional Information".


Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in
judgment.



FEDERAL TAX STATUS





This is a general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences
arising from the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units of a Trust that
intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company" for federal income tax
purposes. The summary is limited to investors who hold the Units as "capital
assets" (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Unitholders should
consult their tax advisers in determining the federal, state, local and any
other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units.


Tax Status of the Trusts. The Trusts have elected to qualify and intend to
qualify annually as regulated investment companies under Subchapter M of the
Code. To qualify as a regulated investment company, a Trust must distribute to
its Unitholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which
includes, among other items, dividends, taxable interest, if any, and the excess
of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and 90% of
its tax-exempt interest income, and meet certain diversification of assets,
source of income, and other requirements. By meeting these requirements, a Trust
generally will not be subject to federal income tax on investment company
taxable income, and on net capital gains (the excess of net long-term capital
gains over net short-term capital losses) reported by a Trust as capital gain
dividends, distributed to Unitholders. A Trust can also avoid an annual
nondeductible 4% excise tax if each calendar year it distributes substantially
all of its ordinary income, short and long-term capital gain, and any previously
undistributed and untaxed amounts.


If for any taxable year a Trust did not qualify as a regulated investment
company, all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at regular corporate
rates without any deduction for distributions to Unitholders, and any
distributions would be taxable to the Unitholders as ordinary dividends to the
extent of such Trust's current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such
distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends received deduction
in the case of corporate Unitholders and the lower federal income tax rate
currently applicable to qualifying dividend income for individual Unitholders,
provided certain holding period requirements were satisfied by the Trust and
the respective Unitholders.


The Trusts may be subject to state or local tax in jurisdictions in which
the Trusts are organized or may be deemed to be doing business.


Distributions. Each Trust intends to make sufficient distributions of
investment company taxable income, if any, capital gains, if any, and
exempt-interest dividends each year in order to qualify as a regulated
investment company and to avoid any Trust-level federal income or excise taxes.
Each Trust intends to be eligible to distribute exempt-interest dividends to
Unitholders by holding a sufficient amount of its assets in bonds generating
interest that is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 103 of the
Code. Such exempt-interest dividends are not subject to regular federal income
tax, but may be subject to alternative minimum tax.


Distributions of investment company taxable income (including net short-term
capital gains), if any, are taxable to Unitholders as ordinary income, and
generally will not qualify for treatment as qualified dividend income currently
taxed at a maximum rate of 15% for individual Unitholders or for the
dividends-received deduction for corporate Unitholders. Any income from your
Trust that you must take into account for federal tax purposes is not reduced
by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any.


Net capital gains of a Trust (net long-term capital gain over net short-term
capital loss), if any, realized and distributed by such Trust and reported as
capital gain dividends are taxable to Unitholders as long-term capital gains
currently at a maximum rate of 15%, without regard to the length of time the
Unitholder may have held his or her Units in the Trust. Capital gain dividends
are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporate Unitholders.
In determining the amount of capital gains to be distributed by a Trust, any
capital loss carry over from a prior year will be taken into account in
determining the amount of net long-term capital gain. Taxable distributions are
taxable to investors whether received in cash or reinvested in additional Units.


When the bonds owned by the Trusts were issued, special bond counsel issued
opinions that the interest on the bonds is not subject to regular federal
income tax (except in the limited circumstances referred to below). Payments
that a Trust receives on a bank letter of credit, guarantee or insurance policy
because the bond issuer has defaulted should be treated as payments on the
bond, namely as payments of principal or interest that are not subject to
regular federal income tax or taxable market discount or capital gain. The
tax-exempt status of the interest depends on compliance by the issuer and
others with ongoing requirements, and the opinions of bond counsel assume that
these requirements will be met. However, there is no guarantee that the issuers
(and other users) will comply with these requirements.


A Trust may have to accrue and distribute income not yet received if it
invests in bonds issued at a discount. A Trust may be required to sell bonds
that it otherwise would have continued to hold in order to generate sufficient
cash to make this distribution.


The interest on some private activity bonds is a preference item included in
alternative minimum taxable income. Each year the Trusts will give to
Unitholders a report showing the percentage of the Trust's income that is a
preference item. In addition, alternative minimum taxable income of a corporate
Unitholder is increased by part of the excess of its "adjusted current earnings"
(an alternative measure of income that includes interest on all tax exempt
securities) over the amount otherwise determined to be alternative minimum
taxable income. Therefore, the exempt-interest dividends may cause a Unitholder
to have to pay the federal alternative minimum tax or may increase the amount of
that tax payable by a Unitholder already subject to federal alternative minimum
tax.


The Trusts may own bonds originally issued at a discount. In general,
original issue discount is the difference between the price at which a bond was
issued and its stated redemption price at maturity. Original issue discount on
tax-exempt bonds accrues as tax-exempt interest over the life of the bond. A
Trust's adjusted tax basis for a bond issued with original issue discount will
include original issue discount accrued during the period it held the bond. A
Trust may also pay a premium when it buys a bond, even a bond issued with
original issue discount. A Trust may be required to amortize the premium over
the term of the bond and reduce its basis for the bond even though it does not
get any deduction for the amortization. Therefore, sometimes the Trust may have
a taxable gain when it sells a bond for an amount equal to or less than its
original tax basis.


Unitholders may receive ordinary income dividends from a Trust if the Trust
sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount, or sells bonds
at a short term capital gain. In general, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
will treat Bonds as market discount bonds when the cost of the bond, plus any
original issue discount that has not yet accrued, is less than the amount due
to be paid at the maturity of the bond. The IRS generally taxes all or a
portion of the gain on the sale of a market discount bond as ordinary income
when the bond is sold, redeemed or paid. The portion of the gain taxed by the
IRS as ordinary income is equal to the portion of the market discount that has
accrued since the seller purchased the bond.


Some of the bonds held by the Trusts may lose their tax-exempt status while
they are owned by a "substantial user" of the facilities being financed with
the proceeds of those bonds, or by persons related to a substantial user. A
"substantial user" is a person whose gross revenue derived with respect to the
facilities financed by the bonds is more than 5% of the total revenue derived
by all users of those facilities, or who occupies more than 5% of the usable
area of the facilities or for whom the facilities or a part thereof were
specifically constructed, reconstructed or acquired. "Related persons" are
certain related individuals, affiliated corporations, partners and
partnerships. This rule would not change the tax-exempt status of interest on
bonds held by other persons. These rules may apply to a Unitholder who receives
exempt-interest dividends attributable to interest on bonds that financed
facilities for which such Unitholder or a related person is a "substantial
user."


Individuals must take exempt-interest dividends into consideration in
computing the portion, if any, of social security benefits that will be included
in their gross income and subject to federal income tax.


If a Trust declares dividends in October, November or December that are
payable to Unitholders of record on a date during those months, Unitholders
must take the dividends into account for tax purposes in the current year, if
the dividend is paid either in the current year or in January of the following
year.


Ordinary, exempt-interest and capital gain dividends will be taxable as
described above whether received in cash or reinvested in additional Units.


If a Trust invests in securities of foreign issuers, it may be subject to
withholding and other similar income taxes imposed by a foreign country.
Dividends and distributions may also be subject to state and local taxes.


Investors should carefully consider the tax implications of buying Units
prior to a distribution by a Trust. The price of Units purchased at that time
includes the amount of the forthcoming distributions. Distributions by a Trust
reduce the net asset value of such Trust's Units, and if a distribution reduces
the net asset value below a Unitholder's cost basis, such distribution,
nevertheless, could be taxable to the Unitholder as ordinary income or capital
gain as described above, even though, from an investment standpoint, it may
constitute a partial return of capital.


Sale or Redemption of Units. Upon the taxable disposition (including a sale
or redemption) of Units of a Trust, a Unitholder may realize a gain or loss
depending upon such Unitholder's adjusted tax basis in the Units and the amount
of sale or redemption proceeds. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital
gain or loss if the Units are capital assets in the Unitholder's hands, and will
be long-term or short-term, generally depending upon the Unitholder's holding
period for the Units. Non-corporate Unitholders are currently subject to tax at
a maximum federal rate of 15% on capital gains resulting from the disposition of
Units held for more than 12 months (zero if the taxpayer is, and would be after
accounting for such gains, subject to the federal 10% or 15% tax bracket for
ordinary income). However, a loss realized by a Unitholder on the disposition of
Units with respect to which capital gains dividends have been paid will, to the
extent of such capital gain dividends, also be treated as long-term capital loss
if such shares have been held by the Unitholder for six months or less. Further,
a loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed to the extent the Units
disposed of are replaced (whether by reinvestment of distributions or otherwise)
within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the
Units are disposed of. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be
adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Capital losses in any year are
deductible only to the extent of capital gains plus, in the case of a
non-corporate taxpayer, $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 for married
individuals filing separately).


Backup Withholding. The Trusts generally must withhold and pay over to the
U.S. Treasury as backup withholding at a current rate of 28% of the taxable
dividends and other distributions paid to any individual Unitholder who either
does not supply its taxpayer identification number, has not reported all of its
dividends and interest income, or does not certify to a Trust that he or she is
not subject to withholding. The social security number of an individual is his
or her taxpayer identification number. Backup withholding also may be required
for a Unitholder upon notification of the Trust by the IRS. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against a
Unitholder's ultimate federal income tax liability if proper documentation is
provided.


Foreign Withholding. Unitholders who are not U.S. persons should consult
their tax adviser regarding the U.S. and foreign tax consequences of ownership
of Units, including the possibility that such a Unitholder may be subject to a
U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or at a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty) on amounts received from a Trust.


Information Statements. After the end of each fiscal year for a Trust, the
Trustee will furnish to each Unitholder a statement containing information
regarding the amount of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary dividends, and
capital gain dividends distributed to such Unitholder during the fiscal year.


Investors Should Consult Their Tax Advisers. Prospective investors are urged
to consult their own tax advisers concerning the federal, state, local,
foreign, and any other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of Units based on their individual circumstances. Additional tax
information is contained in the Information Supplement.



EXPENSES





General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts, provided that organization
costs, and deferred sales charges, if any, are generally paid out of cash
deposited in the Principal Account. The Trustee also may withdraw from these
Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for
any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts. Amounts so withdrawn shall
not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee
shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate Accounts.


Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the
establishment of your Trust. These costs and charges will include the cost of
the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration
statement and other documents relating to your Trust, federal and state
registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, and
legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering Price of Units includes the
estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from
your Trust's assets at the end of the initial offering period or after six
months, if earlier.


Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total
cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive
the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its
services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be reduced as described
therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services is expected to
result from the use of the funds being held in the Principal and Interest
Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions since
these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on
the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for
the first year and as of the close of business on January 1 for each year
thereafter. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be
increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding
proportionate increases under the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or, if this category is not
published, in a comparable category.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b)
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest
rates). Each Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration
statement each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of
the Trusts. When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee,
they are secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for
amounts payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such
amounts.

Municipal Bond Risk Factors



The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds
included in each Trust are described under "Portfolio" in the related Prospectus
Part I. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any
default, failure or defect in any of the bonds.


General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be
general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power
of such entity. All other bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the
income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge
of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.
However, the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by
provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entity's credit will depend on
many factors. Some such factors are the entity's tax base, the extent to which
the entity relies on federal or state aid, and other factors which are beyond
the entity's control. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable only from
the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in
some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue
source. There are, of course, variations in the security of the different bonds
in a Trust, both within a particular classification and between classifications,
depending on numerous factors.


Housing Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their
payments from mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured.
Multi-family housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to
housing projects for low to moderate income families. Single family mortgage
revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial
institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the
issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income. The ability
of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be
affected by various economic and non-economic factors. Such factors include:

occupancy levels, adequate rental income in multi-family projects, the rate of
default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of
mortgage insurers to pay claims. Mortgage loans are generally partially or
completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as
sale of the mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because
these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in
part from such prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such
bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even
prior to their ordinary call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without
premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial
institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified
time period. Additionally, unusually high rates of default on the underlying
mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or
interest on such mortgage revenue bonds. In each case the issuer of the bonds
has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such
issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from
federal income tax under existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of
housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued
prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with
the housing bonds held by a Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of Deposit is not
aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering
the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call
dates.


Health Care Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds.
Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on
feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and
expenses. A facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt service
may be affected by future events and conditions including, among other things,
demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services
required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competition with other health care facilities, efforts by insurers and
governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state
rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost and possible unavailability of
malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third
party payor programs, government regulation and the termination or restriction
of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs. It also may be necessary
for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital
expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its
facilities, equipment, personnel and services. Hospitals and other health care
facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and
others in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that a
claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that
insurance coverage will be available to a facility.


Public Utility and Wholesale Electric Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of public utility issuers, including those selling wholesale and
retail electric power and gas. General problems of such issuers would include
the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary
period, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of the capital
market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable
prices and the effect of energy conservation. In addition, federal, state and
municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing, and
impose additional, regulations governing the licensing, construction and
operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect the ability of the
issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal and/or interest on
such bonds.


Water and Sewer Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers
whose revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such
bonds are generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include
the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.


Industrial Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue
bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant
to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the
operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers.
In some cases, a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as
security for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely
dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many
factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular
company or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings,
regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents
or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or
effected.


Lease Obligation Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are
secured by lease payments of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease
obligations"). Lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of
participation. Although the lease obligations do not constitute general
obligations of the municipality for which the municipality's taxing power is
pledged, a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant
to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation.
However, certain lease obligations contain "nonappropriation" clauses which
provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future
years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A
governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to
take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its
budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A governmental entity's failure
to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result
in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby.
Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are secured by the leased
property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove
difficult.


Higher Educations and Public Education Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, schools,
colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem
taxes or for higher education systems, from tuition, dormitory revenues, grants
and endowments. General problems relating to school bonds include litigation
contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part
from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a disparity in educational funds
available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or
legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the
payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating to college and
university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the
population consisting of "college" age individuals, possible inability to raise
tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the
availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds, the
uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding, and
government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or
costs of such issuers.


Airport and Transportation Bonds. Certain of the bonds in certain of the
Trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived
from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports, bridges,
turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major portion of
an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from
signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments
for leases, occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees. Airport
operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to
meet their obligations under the use agreements. From time to time the air
transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and
traffic, due to increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs,
deregulation, traffic constraints, acts of terrorism and other factors, and
several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties. Similarly,
payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents
from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in
revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of
a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel
and reduction or loss of rents.


Waste Disposal Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid
waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds
may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence
of certain circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or
condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of
raw materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a
project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the
operation of a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render
contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform
or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot
predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in
a Trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.


Original Issue Discount Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at
a market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a Trust were
lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of
comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly issued comparable
bonds increase, the market discount of previously issued bonds will become
greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline,
the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things
being equal. Investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a
market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market
premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds
purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the
prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium Securities and the prepayment
benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A bond purchased at
a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total
return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of
tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market
rates. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II. Market discount
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence
in the issue.


Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero
coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only
the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not
receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds
which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is
that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in
effect, on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which
pay interest.


"When, as and if Issued" Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been purchased
on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. The delivery of any
such bonds may be delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds begins
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. To
the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a Trust after their respective
expected dates of delivery, Unitholders who purchase their Units prior to the
date such bonds are actually delivered to the Trustee would be required to
adjust their tax basis in their Units for a portion of the interest accruing on
such bonds during the interval between their purchase of Units and the actual
delivery of such bonds. As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated
Current Returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated
in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year, assuming the
portfolio of a Trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the
Trustee (which may be reduced in the first year only) do not vary from that set
forth in Prospectus Part I. Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all
bonds in the portfolios including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed
delivery" bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the
evaluation of such bonds) from the date they commit for Units.


Redemption or Sale Prior to Maturity. Certain of the bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund
provisions, call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption
provisions or otherwise. A sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a
period of time for retirement of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which
is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the
issuer. A refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or
before maturity, by the proceeds of a new debt obligation. In general, call
provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is
at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par. The exercise of
redemption or call provisions will (except to the extent the proceeds of the
called bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of
principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest
distributions; it may also affect the current return on Units of the Trust
involved. Each Trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call
provisions, if any, with respect to each of the debt obligations. Extraordinary
optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of
certain events. Generally, events that may permit the extraordinary optional
redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include,
among others: a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable;
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project
for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; an exercise by a local, state or
federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or
substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used;
changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or
facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic; changes in law
or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the
agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance
the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes
excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed on the date the bonds are
issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds; an
administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial
part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds;
an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of
the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to
redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds
resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of
certain bonds in a Trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell, upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties all or any portion of its
rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such
bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for
redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party. A third party
pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to
a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for
redemption had it not sold such rights. The Sponsor is unable to predict all of
the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See
also the discussion of single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds
above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds.


To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the Trusts.


At any time after the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a
variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as, for
example, suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under
environmental protection statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the
tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such
nature can never be entirely predicted, each Trust has received or will receive
opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of
issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the
interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax. In addition, other factors
may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers
to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds.



Puerto Rico Risk Factors



Your Trust may significantly invest in bonds issued by issuers located in
Puerto Rico. Accordingly, an investment in such a Trust should be made with an
understanding of the general risks associated with the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico.


Geographic Location and Demography. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ("Puerto
Rico," or the "Commonwealth") is the fourth largest of the Caribbean islands and
is located approximately 1,600 miles Southeast of New York. It is approximately
100 miles long and 35 miles wide. According to the United States Census Bureau,
the population of Puerto Rico was approximately 3,808,610 in 2000 (3,954,037 as
of July 1, 2008, according to a United States Census Bureau estimate), compared
to 3,522,000 in 1990. However, the Puerto Rico Planning Board (the "Planning
Board") estimates that as of July 2010, the population will be approximately
4,022,446.


Relationship with the United States. Puerto Rico came under United States
sovereignty pursuant to the Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898, which
ended the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United
States since 1917. In 1950, after a long evolution toward greater
self-government, Congress enacted Public Law 600, which provided that the
existing political, economic and fiscal relationship between Puerto Rico and the
United States would remain the same, but Puerto Rico would be authorized to
draft and approve its own Constitution, guaranteeing a republican form of
government. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was drafted by a Constituent
Commission, approved in a special referendum by the people of Puerto Rico,
amended and ratified by the United States Congress, and subsequently approved by
the President of the United States. The official designation of the Government
or body politic has henceforth been "Estado Libre Asociado," which literally
translates to "Free Associated State," and has been called "Commonwealth" by the
United States Government.


The United States and the Commonwealth share a common defense, market and
currency. Puerto Rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal
affairs as any of the fifty states of the United States. However, it differs
from the states in its relationship with the United States federal government.
The people of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States but do not vote in
national elections (they can only vote in local (Puerto Rico) elections). The
people of the Commonwealth are represented in Congress by a Resident
Commissioner who has a voice in the House of Representatives and limited voting
power. Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth in association with the
United States. The chief of state of the Commonwealth is the President of the
United States. The head of government is an elected Governor. There are two
legislative chambers: the House of Representatives, 51 seats, and the Senate, 27
seats.


While Puerto Rico has authority over its internal affairs, the United States
controls interstate trade, foreign relations and commerce, customs
administration, control of air, land and sea, immigration and emigration,
nationality and citizenship, currency, maritime laws, military service, military
bases, army, navy and air force, declaration of war, constitutionality of laws,
jurisdictions and legal procedures, treaties, radio and television
communications, agriculture, mining and minerals, highways, postal system,
social security, and other areas generally controlled by the federal government
in the United States. Puerto Rican institutions control internal affairs unless
U.S. law is involved, as in matters of public health and pollution. The major
differences between Puerto Rico and the 50 states are Puerto Rico's local
taxation system and exemption from Internal Revenue Code, its lack of voting
representation in either house of the U.S. Congress, the ineligibility of Puerto
Ricans to vote in presidential elections, and its lack of assignation of some
revenues reserved for the states.


Economy. The Commonwealth has established policies and programs directed
principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy
and expanding and modernizing the Commonwealth's infrastructure. Domestic and
foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions, development
loans, and other financial and tax incentives. Infrastructure expansion and
modernization have been primarily financed by bonds and notes issued by the
Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities.


Economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of
education and occupational skills of the Commonwealth's population.


The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked to the United States economy, as
most of the external factors that affect the Puerto Rico economy (other than oil
prices) are determined by the policies and performance of the mainland economy.
These external factors include exports, direct investment, the amount of federal
transfer payments, the level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, and
tourist expenditures. During fiscal year 2008 (July 2007 through June 2008),
approximately 74% of Puerto Rico's exports went to the United States mainland,
which was also the source of approximately 47% of Puerto Rico's imports.


Puerto Rico's economy has been in a recession that began in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2006, a fiscal year in which the real gross national
product grew by only 0.5%. Although Puerto Rico's economy is closely linked with
the United States economy, for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, Puerto Rico's real
gross national product decreased by 1.9% and 2.5%, respectively, while the
United States economy grew at a rate of 1.8% and 2.8%, respectively, during the
same periods. According to the Planning Board's recent projections, the economic
contraction has accelerated in fiscal year 2009, with an expected further
reduction in real gross national product of 4.8%. While this trend was expected
to continue in fiscal year 2010, the expected positive impact of the U.S.
federal and local economic stimulus measures led the Planning Board to announce
revised projections for fiscal year 2010 reflecting a projected increase in real
gross national product of 0.7%. The Planning Board is also projecting increases
in real gross national product of 0.9% and 1.0% for fiscal years 2011 and 2012,
respectively.


The dominant sectors of the Puerto Rico economy are manufacturing and
services. The manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the
years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage, high technology
industries, such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, microprocessors,
professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery
and equipment. The service sector, including finance, insurance, real estate,
wholesale and retail trade and tourism, also plays a major role in the economy.
It ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic
product and leads all sectors in providing employment.


The Puerto Rico Planning Board's preliminary reports of the performance of
the Puerto Rico's economy during fiscal year 2008 indicate that the economy
registered a decrease of 2.5% over fiscal year 2007 in total real gross product.
Gross product in fiscal year 2000 was $41.4 billion and gross product in fiscal
year 2008 was $60.8 billion. This represents an increase in gross product of
46.9% from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2008. Aggregate personal income
increased from $52.3 billion in fiscal year 2007 to $56.2 billion in fiscal year
2008, and personal income per capita increased from $13,269 in fiscal year 2007
to $14,237 in fiscal year 2008. The significant increase in personal income in
fiscal year 2008 is due in part to the tax rebate program implemented by the
Bush Administration during that fiscal year.


Among the variables contributing to the decrease in gross national product
were the continuous contraction of the manufacturing and construction sectors,
as well as the current contraction of U.S. economic activity. Furthermore, the
decline in Puerto Rico's gross national product was not offset by the federal
tax rebates due to the high levels of oil prices during fiscal year 2008. The
persistent high level of the price of oil and its derivatives (such as gasoline)
during that period served to reduce the income available for other purchases
and, thereby, negatively affected domestic demand. Due to the Commonwealth's
dependence on oil for power generation and gasoline (in spite of its recent
improvements in power-production diversification), the high level of oil prices
accounted for an increased outflow of local income in fiscal year 2008. The
current difficulties associated with the financial crisis resulted in lower
short-term interest rates, but this did not translate into an improvement in the
construction sector.


According to the Department of Labor and Human Resources Household Employment
Survey, total employment for fiscal year 2009 averaged 1,168,200, a decrease of
4.1% from the previous fiscal year. The unemployment rate for fiscal year 2009
was 13.496, an increase from 11% for fiscal year 2008.


Debt, Revenues and Expenditures. The Constitution of Puerto Rico limits the
amount of general obligation (full faith and credit) debt that can be issued or
guaranteed by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's policy has been and continues
to be to maintain the amount of such debt prudently below the constitutional
limitation. Direct debt of the Commonwealth is supported by Commonwealth taxes.
Debt of municipalities of the Commonwealth, other than bond anticipation notes,
is supported by real and personal property taxes and municipal license taxes. As
of December 31, 2008, total public sector debt of the Commonwealth was equal to
$56,455 million.


The General Fund revenue projection for fiscal year 2009 was $8.488 billion,
an increase of $235 million, or 2.8%, from estimated net revenues for fiscal
year 2008 of $8.253 billion. The Commonwealth's budgeted expenditures for fiscal
year 2009 of $9.484 billion exceed projected revenues by approximately $1
billion.


Bond Ratings. As of January 2010, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the Commonwealth are rated BBB- (with a stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's
Ratings Services ("S&P") and Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
("Moody's"). Any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be
obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will
continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Puerto Rican issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and there is no
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local
obligations in the event of default.


The information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex factors
affecting the financial situation in Puerto Rico and is derived from sources
that are generally available to investors and are believed to be accurate. No
independent verification has been made as to the accuracy or completeness of any
of the preceding information. It is based in part on information obtained from
Commonwealth and local agencies in Puerto Rico or contained in Official
Statements for various Puerto Rico obligations.



Insurance on the Bonds



Insurance has been obtained by the issuer of bonds or by a prior owner of
such bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in an Insured Trust guaranteeing
prompt payment of interest and principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in
such Insured Trust. See "The Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in Prospectus
Part II. The premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer
of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any such policy or policies are
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are
outstanding and the preinsured bond insurer remains in business.


Bond Insurers. The following is a description of the various preinsured bond
insurers:


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty insurance
policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.


On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for ACA
Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration,
provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations and protection for
ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The settlement required that
ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash payment and a distribution of
surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the former collateralized debt
obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other counterparties with
approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial
Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on
actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.


As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets of
$436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a surplus
as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.


On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC,
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA Financial
Guaranty's request.


The information relating to ACA Financial Guaranty contained above has been
furnished by ACA Financial Guaranty or the rating agencies. No representation is
made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two
business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services. Ambac
provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to
pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating
expenses.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions.
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.


On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac Assurance
had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities, primarily
policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured finance
transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate action is
necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In conjunction with
the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has commenced
rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in the
segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or settlement
of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that it had
commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO of ABS
exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.


On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate in
the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac Assurance is
subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of Wisconsin and New
York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to conduct business.


Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December 31,
2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit was
$3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on
investment securities during the period.

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.


In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future
installments related to this transaction.


On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.


On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable outlook.
The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee market,
each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the quality of
each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On November 30,
2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a stable outlook.
The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that Assured Guaranty and
Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to mitigate the largest obligor
concentrations for a higher rating.


On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's updated
view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the financial
guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3, reflecting Moody's
view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile resulting from its
exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in the financial
guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 to Aa3, with a
negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results from Moody's
review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's said that adverse
trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on Assured's main
insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the insurance
financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal at
Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of
Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook. The January 17,
2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business franchise, expected
future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal.


Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to the
effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense,
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$3.10 billion.


The information contained above relating to Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal and their parent company, Assured, is based upon publicly available
information, or upon information that has been provided by the ratings agencies.
No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such
information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such information
subsequent to the date hereof.


Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and
began writing policies in September of 2012.


On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings
based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low
industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating
performance.


As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards
policyholders of $491.0 million.


The information relating to BAM contained above has been furnished by BAM or

Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.


On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near
term.


As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$189.1 billion.

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered into
a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG (together
with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").


On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral.
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3to Caa2,
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease is
primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of
approximately $3.5 million.


The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by CIFG or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to
the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for
public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or
additional risks.


The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS CDOs,
which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS, primarily
backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have resulted in a
substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus over time. On
November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the predecessor to
the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an order pursuant to

Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to, among other
things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently unable to
eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an out-of-court
Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent
of Financial Services of the State of New York (the "Superintendent") filed a
verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order
of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as rehabilitator
("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to take possession
of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business thereof, and

(iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the removal of the
causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation proceeding (the
"Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the commencement of
the Rehabilitation Proceeding.


Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from B1 to
Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On March
24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC
from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of
higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected loss,
and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC from CCC,
with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the ratings on
FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive
financial information will no longer be available.


As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.


On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.


The information relating to FGIC and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by FGIC or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to
the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."),
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance
guarantees.


On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp., announced
the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations following the
approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The restructuring
involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance operations into two
separately capitalized sister companies, with National Guarantee assuming the
risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring
the remainder of the portfolio, including all international and structured
finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC in 2008 has been
assigned to National Guarantee. To provide additional protection for its
municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee has also issued second-to-pay
policies for the benefit of the policyholders covered by the reinsurance and
assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which are a direct obligation of
National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New York Mellon as insurance
trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or FGIC, as applicable, do
not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the policyholders will then be able
to make a claim directly against National Guarantee under the second-to-pay
policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National
Public Finance Guarantee Corporation. Effective December 1, 2009, National
Guarantee was redomesticated to the State of New York and is subject to
insurance regulations and supervision of the State of New York. National
Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, Inc. and independently
capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources as of December 31,
2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation may
operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005-2007
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss
assumptions on its 2005-2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook.


As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets of
$5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus as
regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.


As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets of
$22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.

Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. ("Radian Group"),
headquartered in Philadelphia, provides private mortgage insurance and related
risk mitigation products and services to mortgage lenders nationwide through its
principal operating subsidiary, Radian Guaranty Inc. ("Radian Guaranty").
Radian, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radian Guaranty, is domiciled and licensed
in New York as a financial guaranty insurer. In the third quarter of 2008,
Radian discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business, including
accepting reinsurance.


On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating
of Radian, as well as the ratings of its operational affiliates, from A3 to Ba1,
with a stable outlook, reflecting the substantial deterioration in the credit
profile of Radian Guaranty, coupled with increased loss estimates on Radian's
pooled corporate exposures. On November 24, 2009, S&P lowered the financial
strength, financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB
from BBB- and left the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications,
reflecting S&P's view that adverse loss development in Radian's insured
portfolio has resulted in higher capital charges and could result in further
losses. On December 22, 2009, S&P lowered the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB- from BB, with a
negative outlook.


As of September 30, 2012, Radian Group had total assets of $6.45 billion and
total liabilities of $5.43 billion. As of September 30, 2012, Radian had a
statutory policyholders' surplus of $1.02 billion and a contingency reserve of
$290.9 million.


The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora Holdings
Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee insurance
company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to the public
finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States and
internationally.


In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's severely
impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory capital
requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On October
24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Syncora
Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance
financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with developing
expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the Syncora
Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow progress in
its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On January 29,
2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of Syncora
Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange criteria.
On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a result of the
large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora Guarantee on
its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which have resulted in
a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of December 31, 2008.
On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and financial enhancement
ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under
regulatory supervision because of its financial condition). Also on April 27,
2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from
CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay one or more of its financial
obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted
from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York
Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company must suspend any and all claims
payments until it has restored its policyholders' surplus to a level greater
than or equal to $65 million, the minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010,
S&P withdrew the D counterparty credit rating and the R financial strength and
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings
actions resulted from S&P's belief that there is not sufficient information to
judge Syncora Guarantee's claims paying ability.


As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17 billion
and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders' surplus of
$504.2 million.


On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after
July 21, 2010.

Portfolio Administration



The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,
will consider a variety of factors including (a) interest rates, (b) market
value and (c) marketability. The Sponsor, in connection with the Quality Trusts
and Investment Grade Municipal Trusts, may direct the Trustee to dispose of
bonds if the Supervisor determines that there exists any default in payment of
principal or interest, institution of certain legal proceedings, default under
other documents adversely affecting debt service, default in payment of
principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer, decline in
projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or decline in price
or occurrence of other market or credit factors, including advance refunding
(i.e., the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit of the proceeds
thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on their respective
redemption dates), so that in the opinion of the Supervisor the retention of
such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the Unitholders. In
connection with the Insured Trusts to the extent that bonds are sold which are
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality
of the bonds remaining in such Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. Except
as described in this section and in certain other unusual circumstances for
which it is determined by the Trustee to be in the best interests of the
Unitholders or if there is no alternative, the Trustee is not empowered to sell
bonds from an Insured Trust which are in default in payment of principal or
interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value has been
attributed for the insurance obtained by such Insured Trust. Because of
restrictions on the Trustee under certain circumstances, the Sponsor may seek a
full or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units in
an Insured Trust. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus
Part II. The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to
dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.


The Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes. The Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid
imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


The Sponsor will generally instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or
substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if

(1) the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written
opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such
bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received in
exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and
conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in
exchange or substitution for underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give
notice thereof to each Unitholder of the Trust thereby affected, identifying the
bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor. Except as stated herein and
under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding
the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a
Trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not
permitted.


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor within 30 days, the Trustee is
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell
the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby
incurred.



Sponsor Information



Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of the Trust. The Sponsor is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco Advisers"). Invesco
Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., a leading
independent global investment manager that provides a wide range of investment
strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net worth clients
around the globe. On June 1, 2010, Invesco Ltd. acquired the retail asset
management business, including Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (then known as Van
Kampen Funds Inc.), from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. The Sponsor's
principal office is located at 11 Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As
of September 30, 2012, the total stockholders' equity of Invesco Capital
Markets, Inc. was $95,560,974 (unaudited). The current assets under management
and supervision by Invesco Ltd. and its affiliates were valued at approximately
$683.0 billion as of September 30, 2012. (This paragraph relates only to the
Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other Series thereof. The information is
included herein only for the purpose of informing investors as to the financial
responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out its contractual
obligations. More detailed financial information will be made available by the
Sponsor upon request.)


The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.



Trustee Information



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted
by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any
applicable state or Federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is required
to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement on file in
its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during the usual
business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the bonds held
in the Trusts.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor.
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.



Taxation



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income
tax issues concerning your Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of
Trust Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Trust Units, as well
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S.
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your Trust. The Internal Revenue Service could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our
counsel was not asked to review the assets to be held by your Trust.


Your Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a "regulated
investment company" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will
not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its
Unitholders.


In addition, your Trust intends to hold a sufficient amount of its assets in
bonds that are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 103 of the
Code so as to qualify to distribute exempt-interest dividends to you. Such
exempt-interest dividends are not subject to regular U.S. federal income tax,
but may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Your Trust may hold bonds
issued by the Government of Puerto Rico or by its authority. Such bonds are
exempt from taxation by the U.S. federal government, the government of Puerto
Rico, any state or its political subdivisions, any possession of the United
States, or the District of Columbia.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Trust must, among other things,

(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or
currencies, and net income from qualified publicly traded partnerships; (b)
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year,

(i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is represented by
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. Government securities, the
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust's
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is
invested in the securities (other than U.S. Government securities or the
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the Trust controls (by owning 20% or more of the issuer's
outstanding voting securities) and which are engaged in the same, similar or
related trades or businesses, or the securities of qualified publicly traded
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net
short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes
net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income
each taxable year. Complying with these requirements may result in the capital
gains impact on Unitholders described in more detail in the next paragraph.


As a regulated investment company, your Trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends
paid), if any, and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain
over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders.
Your Trust intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually,
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain,
if any. If your Trust retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable
income, it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate
rates on the amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely
basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to
a nondeductible 4% excise tax. In order to avoid this excise tax, your Trust
must distribute during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at
least 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or
losses) for the calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess
of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year
period ending October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and
capital gains for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those
years. To prevent application of the excise tax, your Trust intends to make its
distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. At
certain times your Trust may recognize capital gains from securities sold to
generate cash to satisfy Unitholder redemption requests. In order to satisfy the
capital gains distribution requirement, your Trust may report a portion of other
income earned during the year, or "reclassify" previously distributed income,
including tax-exempt income, as taxable net capital gain, thereby avoiding the
need to sell additional securities to generate the necessary funds to meet the
distribution requirement. Further, if your Trust retains any net capital gain,
the Trust may report the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a
notice to Unitholders who, if subject to federal income tax on long-term capital
gains (i) will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes,
as long-term capital gain, their share of such undistributed amount, and (ii)
will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the
Trust against their federal income tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds
to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. A distribution will be
treated as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is declared by
your Trust in October, November or December with a record date in such a month
and paid by your Trust during January of the following calendar year. These
distributions will be taxable to Unitholders in the calendar year in which the
distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the
distributions are received.


If your Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income
were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and
profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend income.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to state, local, or foreign taxes in
connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal (including the
federal alternative minimum tax), state, local, and foreign tax consequences
that may affect them as a result of an investment in the Trust.



Termination of the Trust Agreement



A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the
Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of such
Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the original
principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the
event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust
would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount of such Trust.
If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the
Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement provides that each
Trust shall terminate upon the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last
bond held in such Trust, but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the
year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of an
IM-IT, an IM-IT Laddered Series, an Investment Grade Municipal, an Investment
Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust, an IM-IT Discount, a U.S. Territorial
IM-IT, a High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, a Long-Term State or a
National Quality Trust, or beyond the end of the year preceding the twentieth
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Strategic Municipal Trust
Intermediate Series, an IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, an IM-IT Intermediate
Trust, a State Intermediate Trust, a State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust,
an IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust, an Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate
Trust and a Quality Municipals Income Trust Limited Maturity Series. In the
event of termination of any Trust, written notice thereof will be sent by the
Trustee to each Unitholder of such Trust at his address appearing on the
registration books of a Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bond then held in such Trust and
shall deduct from the funds of such Trust any accrued costs, expenses or
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges. The
sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to
Unitholders of an Insured Trust, it should be noted that because the portfolio
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is applicable only while bonds
so insured are held by such Trust, the price to be received by such Trust upon
the disposition of any such bond which is in default, by reason of nonpayment of
principal or interest, will not reflect any value based on such insurance.
Therefore, in connection with any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for the
Trustee to, and the Trustee does not currently intend to, dispose of any bond or
bonds if retention of such bond or bonds, until due, shall be deemed to be in
the best interest of Unitholders, including, but not limited to, situations in
which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from
a significant risk of default. Since the Preinsured Bonds will reflect the value
of the related insurance, it is the present intention of the Sponsor not to
direct the Trustee to hold any of such Preinsured Bonds after the date of
termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from insurance on
defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be
distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as
practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and
applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the Trustee.



Description of Ratings



Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information
furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it
considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection
with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial
information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result
of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other
circumstances.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:


I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.


II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.


III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories.


NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.


Moody's Investors Service. Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the
investment quality of issuers and issues in the U.S. municipal and tax-exempt
markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default
probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues. The default and loss
content for Moody's municipal long-term rating scale differs from Moody's
general long-term rating scale.


Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt levels,
governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated individually and for
its effect on the other factors in the context of the municipality's ability to
repay its debt.


Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness
relative to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.



Equivalent Taxable Estimated Current Return Tables



As of the date of the Prospectus Part I, the following tables show the
approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are
equivalent to tax-exempt estimated current returns under combined federal and
state taxes (where applicable) using the published marginal federal and state
tax rates currently scheduled to be in effect in 2013. These tables illustrate
approximately what you would have to earn on taxable investments to equal the
tax-exempt estimated current return in your income tax bracket. The tables
assume that federal taxable income is equal to state income subject to tax, and
for cases in which more than one state rate falls within a federal bracket, the
state rate corresponding to the highest income within that federal bracket is
used. The combined federal and state tax rates shown reflect the fact that state
tax payments are currently deductible for federal tax purposes. The tables do
not reflect any local taxes, any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other
than personal income taxes. The tables do not show the approximate taxable
estimated current returns for individuals that are subject to the alternative
minimum tax. The tables do not reflect the effect of federal or state
limitations (if any) on the amount of allowable itemized deductions or credits.
See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II for a more detailed discussion of
federal tax rules applicable to an investment in the Trust.

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current returns
with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in
making an investment decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its
advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on
the Trusts and returns over specified periods on other similar Invesco
sponsored unit investment trusts with inflation rates and with returns on
taxable investments such as corporate or U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and
money market accounts or money market funds, each of which has investment
characteristics that may differ from those of the Trusts. U.S. Government bonds,
for example, are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.
Money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal, but
pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the short-term debt
market. The investment characteristics of the Trusts are described more fully in
the prospectus.



Estimated Cash Flows to Unitholders



The table below sets forth the per Unit estimated monthly distributions of
interest and principal to Unitholders. The table assumes no changes in expenses,
no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges, redemptions, sales or
prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or expected retirement
date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected retirement date. To
the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual distributions will vary.

Re:      Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1148 (the "Trust")




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel for Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. as depositor and
sponsor (the "Depositor") of the Trust in connection with the deposit of
securities (the "Securities") therein pursuant to the Indenture referred to
below, by which the Trust was created and under which the units of fractional
undivided interest (collectively, the "Units") have been issued. Pursuant to the
Indenture, the Depositor has transferred to the Trust certain bonds and
contracts to purchase certain bonds together with irrevocable letters of credit
to be held by the Trustee upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Indenture. (All bonds to be acquired by the Trust are collectively referred to
as the "Bonds.")


In connection with our representation, we have examined the originals or
certified copies of the following documents relating to the creation of the
Trust, the deposit of the Securities and the issuance and sale of the Units: (a)
the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust For Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal
Series, Effective for Unit Investment Trusts Established On and After December
4, 2012 (Including Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1130 and Subsequent
Series) and the Trust Agreement of even date herewith relating to the Trust
(collectively, the "Indenture") among the Depositor, Invesco Investment Advisers
LLC, as supervisor, The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and
Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., a subsidiary of the McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc., as evaluator; (b) the Closing Memorandum relating to the
deposit of the Securities in the Trust, which includes certification by an
authorized officer of the Depositor with respect to certain factual matters
contained therein ("Officer's Certification"); (c) the Notification of
Registration on Form N-8A and the Registration Statements on Form N-8B-2, as
amended, relating to the Trust, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"); (d) the Registration Statement on Form S-6
(Registration No. 333-185918) filed with the Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and all Amendments thereto
(said Registration Statement, as amended by said Amendment(s) being herein
called the "Registration Statement"); (e) the proposed form of final prospectus
(the "Prospectus") relating to the Units, which is expected to be filed with the
Commission this day; (f) the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Depositor, as amended, each certified to by an authorized officer of the
Depositor; and (g) certificates or telegrams of public officials as to matters
set forth upon therein.


We have assumed the genuineness of all agreements, instruments and documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to originals of all copies
thereof submitted to us. We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures
and the legal capacity of all persons executing agreements, instruments and
documents examined or relied upon by us.


Where matters are stated to be "to the best of our knowledge" or "known to us,"
our knowledge is limited to the actual knowledge of those attorneys in our
office who have performed services for the Trust, their review of documents
provided to us by the Depositor in connection with this engagement and inquiries
of officers of the Depositor, the results of which are reflected in the
Officer's Certification. We have not independently verified the accuracy of the
matters set forth in the written statements or certificates upon which we have
relied. We have not reviewed the financial statements, compilation of the Bonds
held by the Trust, or other financial or statistical data contained in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as to which we understand you have
been furnished with the reports of the accountants appearing in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus. In addition, we have made no specific inquiry as
to whether any stop order or investigatory proceedings have been commenced with
respect to the Registration Statement or the Depositor nor have we reviewed
court or governmental agency dockets.


Statements in this opinion as to the validity, binding effect and enforceability
of agreements, instruments and documents are subject: (i) to limitations as to
enforceability imposed by bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, insolvency and
other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights, and (ii) to limitations under equitable principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies.


We are not admitted to the practice of law in any jurisdiction but the State of
New York and we do not hold ourselves out as experts in or express any opinion
as to the laws of other states or jurisdictions except as to matters of federal
law. No opinion is expressed as to the effect that the law of any other
jurisdiction might have upon the subject matter of the opinions expressed herein
under applicable conflicts of law principles, rules or regulations or otherwise.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


(1) The Indenture has been duly authorized and executed and delivered by an
authorized officer of the Depositor and is a valid and binding obligation of the
Depositor in accordance with its terms.


(2) The registration of the Units on the registration books of the Trust by the
Trustee has been duly authorized by the Depositor in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture and issued for the consideration contemplated
therein, the Units will constitute fractional undivided interests in the Trust,
will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and will conform in all
material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus. Upon
payment of the consideration for the Units as provided in the Indenture and the
Registration Statement, the Units will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable by the Trust.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Registration Statement
and in the related Prospectus. This opinion is intended solely for the benefit
of the addressee in connection with the issuance of the Units of the Trust and
may not be relied upon in any other manner or by any other person without our
express written consent.


Very truly yours,

Brooklyn, NY 11217


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We are acting as your counsel in connection with the execution and delivery
by you of a certain trust agreement, dated as of today (the "Indenture"), among
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (the "Depositor"), Invesco Investment Advisers
LLC, as supervisor (the "Supervisor"), Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations,
Inc., a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (the "Evaluator"), and you, as
Trustee, establishing Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1148 (the "Trust"),
and the registration by you, as Trustee, on the registration books of the Trust,
of ownership of all of the units of fractional undivided interests ("Units") in
the Trust, as set forth in the prospectus, dated today, for filing as an
amendment to the registration statement heretofore filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (respectively
the "Prospectus" and the "Registration Statement"), relating to the Trust (File
Number 333-185918). The Trust consists of the securities set forth in the
Prospectus (including delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase
of certain securities not yet delivered and cash, cash equivalents, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a combination thereof, in the amount required
to pay for such purchase upon the receipt of such securities) defined in the
Indenture as "Securities" and listed in Schedule A to the Indenture (such
securities, delivery statements and cash, cash equivalents or letter of credit
being herein called the "Underlying Securities").


We have examined the Indenture and originals (or copies certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments,
certificates and documents, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of rendering this opinion letter. In such examination, we have assumed
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted
to us as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to this opinion letter, we
have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the
aforesaid instruments, certificates and documents.


Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1.   The Bank of New York Mellon is a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of New York with the powers of a trust company under the Banking
Law of the State of New York.


2.   The execution of the Indenture is within the authorization of the executing
officers of The Bank of New York Mellon.


3.   The Indenture is in proper form for execution and delivery by you as
Trustee.


4.   Upon receipt by you of the Underlying Securities you may properly register
the units on the registration books of the Trust in the name of Cede & Co.,
as nominee of Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Upon receipt of advice of
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, you may cause the Units to
be credited to, or upon the order of, the Depositor, as provided in the
Closing Memorandum being executed and delivered today by the parties to the
Indenture.


5.   You as Trustee may lawfully, under the Banking Law of the State of New
York, advance to the Trust such amounts as may be necessary to provide
periodic distributions or payment of expenses for the Trust, and be
reimbursed without interest for any such advances from funds in the income
or capital account for the Trust on the ensuing record date or as otherwise
provided in the Indenture.


In rendering the foregoing opinions we have not considered, among other
things, the merchantability of the Underlying Securities, whether the Underlying
Securities have been duly authorized and delivered and are fully paid for and
non-assessable or the tax status of the Underlying Securities under any federal,
state or local laws.


The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York and
the federal laws of the United States of America.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name and the reference to our firm
in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus.


Very truly yours,

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.
