A Customer Writes:
To the folks at Robert Craig ~

I don't believe I've ever written to a company in praise of a product before.  However, my experience with your hair color has finally prompted me to write.

I am 47 and have been coloring my hair since age 25, when I started getting my first grays.  I've used highlights, semi-permanent, demi-permanent, and permanent hair colors and with a few exceptions, have always colored at home using "drugstore" products.

I found Robert Craig hair color online while looking for a less damaging alternative to traditional permanent hair colors.  My hair was dry and fried from using drugstore products, and I was really tired of being dissatisfied with the condition of my hair.  I began using Robert Craig hair color in November 2007 and have finally gotten to the point where my hair has grown out and been cut enough that all the previously colored (with drugstore colors) hair is gone.  My hair is softer than it has been since I started coloring 22 years ago.  The Robert Craig hair color looks so incredibly natural, my hair looks like it did in high school again.  And the way it feels to the touch is completely different now.  It is soft again, not fried.

Thank you so much -- I will never use another hair coloring product.  Never!

New Items HAVE ARRIVED in our Shopping Cart
We have added a few new products so be sure and check the shopping cart by clicking on the button above marked "Shop for Products Here".
Our new vitamin supplement called Healthy Hair is here. After years of seeing prenatal vitamins have a positive health effect on our client's hair we decided to research a vitamin and mineral suppliment that would give you the healthiest hair possible. Since healthy hair starts from the inside out and is so dependant on one's diet this is sure to give you the best looking hair ever. Combine this with our 'no damage' hair color and you can experience a whole new you. Order from the shopping cart or read more here.
You have told us that it would be nice to apply the hair color with a brush. So, we have introduced a couple hair color applicator brush choices including an exciting foam brush hair color applicator kit. We also have a professional hair color bowl. In order to apply our color with a brush the below mentioned mixer does need to be used.
The most exciting new product is a hair color mixer to make mixing of the color very easy. It thickens the color much faster and more than shaking and makes it thick enough to be applied with a brush if you so desire. These new items are from your suggestions and we hope you will be as excited about them as we are.
We have also introduced our favorite styling brush, a boar bristle and vent brush in one. To read more click here.
