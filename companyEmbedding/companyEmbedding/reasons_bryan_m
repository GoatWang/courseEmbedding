Bryan & Jeffrey EisenbergProfessional Speakers, Best Selling Authors, Online Marketing PioneersOctober 21, 2011  by Bryan Eisenberg 23 Comments What Makes People Buy? 20 Reasons Why.
Our mentor, Roy Williams, described shoppers as operating in either one of two modes: transactional or relational, a few years ago. At that time some of us loafed around virtually, exchanging emails with friends, trying to complete a list of reasons that motivate people to buy things. (Thank you, Tom G. & Brett F.) More recently, we returned to compiling the list with the rest of my colleagues. Trying to understand these types of things is what drives us. It also benefits our clients.
What follows below is what we came up with, albeit likely incomplete. As you read this list, can you identify which of these motivations is relational and which are transactional? Can you see where they each fit within Maslow’s hierarchy of needs [define]? Will you help us find additional motivations?
Some of these are self-explanatory. The forces that influence whether people buy include:
Basic Needs – We buy things to fulfill what Maslow describes as the bottom of his hierarchy; things like food and shelter.
Convenience – You need something now and will take the easiest or fastest path to get it. Think about the last time you were running out of gas, or were thirsty and found the nearest beverage of choice. This could also be choosing the safe vendor (no one ever gets fired for hiring IBM), purchasing something to increase comfort or efficiency.
Replacement – Sometimes you buy because you need to replace old things you have (e.g., clothes that don’t fit or are out-of-date). This could be moving from a VCR to a DVD player.
Scarcity – This could be around collectibles or a perceived need that something may run out or have limited availability in the future. Additionally, there’s a hope to gain a return on investment, such as collectible or antiques; anything that accrues value over time.
Prestige or Aspirational purchase – Something is purchased for an esteem-related reason or for personal enrichment.
Emotional Vacuum – Sometimes you just buy to try to replace things you cannot have and never will.
Lower prices – Something you identified earlier as a want is now a lower price than before. Maybe you were browsing for a particular large screen TV and you saw a great summer special.
Great Value – When the perceived value substantially exceeds the price of a product or service. This is something you don’t particularly need, you just feel it’s too good a deal to pass up. (Like the stuff they place near the end caps or checkout counters of stores.)
Name Recognition – When purchasing a category you’re unfamiliar with, branding plays a big role. Maybe you had to buy diapers for a family member and you reach for Pampers because of you’re familiarity with the brand, even though you don’t have children yourself.
Fad or Innovation – Everybody wants the latest and greatest. (iPhone mania.) This could also be when someone mimics their favorite celebrity.
Compulsory Purchase – Some external force, like school books, uniforms, or something your boss asked you to do, makes it mandatory. This often happens in emergencies, such as when you need a plumber.
Ego Stroking – Sometimes you make a purchase to impress/attract the opposite sex; to have something bigger/better than others, friends, etc. To look like an expert/aficionado; to meet a standard of social status, often exceeding what’s realistically affordable to make it at least seem like you operate at a higher level.
Niche Identity – Something that helps bond you to a cultural, religious or community affiliation. Maybe you’re a Harvard alumni and Yankee fan who keeps kosher. (You can also find anti-niche identity by rebellion, assuming you’re pretty comfortable with irony.)
Peer Pressure – Something is purchased because your friends want you to. You may need to think back to your teen years to think of an example.
The “Girl Scout Cookie Effect” – People feel better about themselves by feeling as though they’re giving to others, almost especially when they’re promised something in return. Purchasing things they don’t need–or wouldn’t normally purchase–because it will help another person or make the world a better place incrementally is essential certain buying decision.
Reciprocity or Guilt – This happens when somebody–usually an acquaintance, or someone rarely gift-worthy–buys you a gift or does something exceptionally nice and/or unnecessary. Now it’s your turn to return the favor at the next opportunity. Examples:

Event – When the social decorum of an event (e.g., wedding, bar mitzvah, etc.) dictates buying something or another.
Holiday – ‘Nuff said.

Empathy – Sometimes people buy from other people because they listened and cared about them even if they had the lesser value alternative.
Addiction – This is outside the range of the normal human operating system, but it certainly exists and accounts for more sales than any of us can fathom.
Can you think back to the last time you bought something and fully explain the reason why?
Fear – From pink Taser™ stun guns to over-sized SUV’s to backyard bomb shelters–and even stuff so basic as a tire pressure gauge–are bought out of fear. So, before you go knocking “fear” as a motivator, ask yourself: Are you Y2K compliant?
Indulgence – Who doesn’t deserve a bit of luxury now and then? So long as you can afford it, sometimes there’s no better justification for that hour-long massage, that pint of Cherry Garcia ice cream, or that $75 bottle of 18-year single malt scotch other than “you’re worth it” (best when said to self in front of mirror with a wink and/or head tilt).
These are the things we’ve helped clients think about. We hope this list at least gets you started. And let us know if you need help understanding your customers motivations. It’s what we do. But in the meantime…
What do you feel motivates people to buy? More importantly, what makes them buy your product of service?

I think that sometimes we purchase to retain something we’re losing. An example could be our health, professional accreditation (eg lawyers attending courses so they can continue to practice) and so on.

Lance,
#21 reason for myself. Education and health maintenance. Most definitely I feel I am losing my vocabulary, writing skills and spelling. It keeps deteriorating over the years and I want to get it back and continue to enhance it. Memory skills are in need of updating – talk about an over abundance of information and technology. I no longer even remember phone numbers.
Possibly this could fall under the ‘Replacement’ category!

I think there is also an important point regarding post-sales and ongoing support. These days added services and value encourage people to purchase, they could buy it cheaper elsewhere but the decision has already been made to purchase, now its finding a site who can be ‘trusted’ or meets similar ideals as the purchaser. If your site charges a few percent more than a less trusted or compatible supplier, but wins on other key points, it will make someone purchase especially in the after-sales and added value areas.

I challenged myself to come up with a motivation that wasn’t listed here, mentally scanning through the information retained from all the articles, studies, blog posts, reports, and books I’ve read over the years.  I came up empty-handed. This list is fantastic in its thoroughness (and the simplicity of its examples/explanations). This though, of course, is anything but surprising considering who wrote the list. Thank you for the post Bryan; this one’s a permanent bookmark that will definitely be shared with many.

Scarcity – This could be around collectibles or a perceived need that something may run out or have limited availability in the future. Additionally, there’s a hope to gain a return on investment, such as collectible or antiques; anything that accrues value over time. (Because it’s a memory that you can share with anyone and will never be able to capture that moment again exactly as it was at that specific time and day. It’s tied to emotions hopefully of love, family, health, happiness, fulfilment and feeling good about yourself. A memory or a story of our life that is self explanatory for anyone to see or share it with)

[…] Buying products and services has become easier for customers. We do not need to walk to the shop to buy all the things we need, online stores are making life easier for us. We can review and compare products before buying. The social media provides information about products we want to purchase. There are reviews on products and services that make you trust the product. I like the idea of online chat on websites because you can get some of your questions answered and doubts cleared before buying.

The Brainpower it Takes To Buy a Salad | My Blog

[…] Bryan Eisenburg feels there are twenty reasons or categories to why people make the purchasing decision they do. He starts with the most realistic reason of “basic need”. I am going to take you on a little journey myself of a purchase I have made that fits this category. A salad. So this little green wonder is simple enough, but the ridiculously quick process of thought my brain went through to reach this leafy conclusion includes more than what can fit under the basic need category.

Is there data (or, in marketing parlance, “analytics”) on the different mindsets of a consumer purchasing a product (e.g., pair of shoes) and professional services (e.g., psychotherapy or education)? I appreciate all your input and suggestions.

Don’t forget that money depreciates and if you dont buy it today it will be more expensive the next day. Not for technology though.
