Why Digital Power Corporation (DPW) Exploded to a One-Year High Today
Digital Power Corporation (DPW) soared to a one-year high on Wednesday after the company announced it had received a five-year contract from Israel Aerospace Industries. Digital Power will provide its low-voltage power supply multiple outputs converter to IAI for the duration of the contract, which covers the manufacturing and delivery of the LVPS modules. IAI will use the LVPS to power the TAMAM Modular Azimuth Position System (TMAPS) navigation system, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) uses in tactical warfare. The LVPS is designed to operate in battlefield scenarios in which jamming or other methods have disturbed GPS. It features a capability that should supply the TMAPS with continuous, stable power through multiple sources regardless of the operating conditions.
