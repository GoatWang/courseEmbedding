History[edit]
The company was formed in December 2002 when American Financial Group transferred its outstanding common stock for Infinity Insurance Companies, Leader Insurance, Windsor Auto, Atlanta Casualty Companies, and Great American Personal Lines into Infinity Property & Casualty. Infinity became a publicly traded company in February 2003 with its listing on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. Infinity Insurance received an A rating from the Better Business Bureau.[1] A.M. Best rates Infinity's financial strength as “A” (Excellent).[2]
Products[edit]
Infinity offers three types of personal car insurance policies, which differ based on the amount of coverage they provide. Infinity also sells commercial vehicle insurance and classic collector or exotic automobile insurance.
Competition[edit]
According to its web site, Infinity is the third largest provider of nonstandard car insurance through independent agents in the nation.

Competitors include other writers of nonstandard insurance like GEICO, Progressive, and The Hartford as well as more traditional providers like Allstate, State Farm, USAA, and Nationwide.
Emerging markets[edit]
According to an annual Brand Survey administered by the independent research group Sentenium[3] Infinity was called, "the most recognized brand among Hispanics" in California for 2007 and 2008.
Eco-friendly focus[edit]
According to a press release,[4] Infinity replaced its fleet of 400 sport utility vehicles with a more fuel efficient model. This move to become climate neutral is one part of an overall effort by Infinity to "go green".
President and CEO Jim Gober discusses Infinity's new eco-friendly vehicle fleet.[5][6]
