The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

日本が誇る蒸留酒、焼酎 — MIZUNOMAI


















































日本が誇る蒸留酒、焼酎








SHOCHU, THE JAPANESE SPIRITJapanese shochu (焼酎) is a distilled spirit that is remarkably smooth and light with delicate, earthy notes seldom found in Western spirits. These distinctive flavors are a tribute to the local harvests - typically barley, sweet potato, sugar cane or rice - and are rooted in a deep appreciation for the purity and perfection found in nature. To capture the true essence of these ingredients, ‘honkaku’ (authentic style) shochu is distilled only one time. The traditional method of single distillation preserves and highlights the naturally occurring oils and aromas that deliver the spirit’s unfamiliar, yet exquisite flavors.Today, there are roughly 500 working distilleries producing over 5,000 unique brands of shochu in Japan. Most of these are scattered throughout the pristine countryside on the island of Kyushu. Once perceived to be old-fashioned, an old man’s liquor, shochu is now the favorite of a younger generation of Japanese drinkers. It has even become more popular than sake; an ongoing trend that has been fueled by both men and women in their 20’s and 30’s who are rediscovering the complexities of the 500 year old spirit. Some of the appeal has been brought on by a number of reported health-related benefits, most notably that shochu has a lower calorie count when compared to other spirits. The “sho” character (焼) means fired or burned, and the “chu” character (酎) means to concentrate, giving the meaning that shochu is a type of alcohol concentrated by fire.

Notes
Mizu is proudly distilled by the Munemasa Shuzo Co. of Arita, Japan. While honoring the traditional shuzo methods, Munemasa is driven by a passion to craft the unexpected and to create shochu of uncommon character. Founded in 1985, Munemasa infuses creativity, innovation and a unique perspective into the traditional ese spirit. This is the way of our master distillers, Wada-san and Okoba-san, who make the Mizunomai in the artisanal, old-style method, while adding unusual and unconventional twists for the more bold shochu lover. Japanese shochu is a distilled spirit that is remarkably smooth and light with delicate, earthy notes seldom found in Western spirits.
These distinctive flavors are a tribute to the local harvests – typically barley, sweet potato, sugar cane or rice – and are rooted in a deep appreciation for the purity and perfection found in nature.
