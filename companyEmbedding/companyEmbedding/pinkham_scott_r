Biographies of Directors and Executive Officers

Mark M. Comerford was elected President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company in October 2008. Before joining the Company, from 2004 to 2008, Mr. Comerford was President of Brush Engineered Materials Alloy Division and President of Brush International, Inc., affiliates of Materion Corporation, formerly known as Brush Engineered Materials, Inc., a company that manufactures high‑performance materials. The Board believes Mr. Comerford’s years of experience driving international growth at various advanced materials manufacturing companies provide valuable strategic insights to the Board. In addition, his leadership experience and acumen in strategic and operating roles based in the United States and Asia, as well as his experience as a top executive at Haynes, all make him well qualified to serve as a director.

Michael L. Shor has been a director since August 1, 2012.
