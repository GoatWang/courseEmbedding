Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Ronald Roach  By Ronald Roach  September 2, 1996   He's the latest red-hot executive to hit restaurant-rich Bethesda, but Norman J. Abdallah has his eyes on a distant market. Last month Red Hot Concepts Inc. hired Abdallah away from Brinker International Inc. in Dallas to expand Red Hot's overseas property, the Chili's Grill & Bar restaurant chain, based in Bethesda. Abdallah had impeccable credentials for the job because he already had managed the launching of 31 Chili's franchises abroad for Brinker, which controls the 500 restaurants in the Chili's chain, including 11 in the Washington area. Red Hot bought franchise development rights for Chili's in Britain, Australia and New Zealand from Brinker two years ago. "Over the past two years in our relationship with Brinker's, Norman has been the key person dealing with the international market," said Colin Halpern, Red Hot's founder and chairman, who vacated the position of president to make way for Abdallah. "I decided that it was time to bring someone of Norman's background and experience in to help build the company." Abdallah, 33, has been in the restaurant business for 18 years, having begun as a boy in his family's soup and sandwich restaurant in Waxahachie, Tex. When his father turned down his request for wages, he found a paying job at K-Bob's steakhouse, where he worked during high school and college, eventually rising to direct franchise operations and development. Abdallah joined Brinker International in 1987 as an assistant manager at a Chili's in Dallas after hearing founder Norman Brinker give a motivational speech. Brinker is a pioneer in the casual-dining business. He started the Steak and Ale chain in 1966 and his company is one of the largest in the field in the United States, operating five restaurant chains, including the flagship Chili's Grill & Bar. A succession of Brinker International jobs led to Abdallah's promotion three years ago to vice president of franchise operations and development, with oversight of the management of 146 franchise restaurants in the United States and 12 other countries. At Red Hot, Abdallah will have to sell the idea of casual dining to consumers unfamiliar with American-style chains. "There's a pretty big gap between Americans and the others," Abdallah said. Australians dine out an average of 2.2 times a week while Britons venture into restaurants nearly three times a week. Americans, meanwhile, eat an average of five meals a week away from home. The gap "is closing gradually," Abdallah said, adding that the key to winning over diners in foreign markets unused to casual-dining restaurants will be to sell the core concept of the restaurant while adapting the overall theme to accommodate local interests and tastes. Before Abdallah's arrival Red Hot Concepts had opened three Chili's units in Britain and two more in Australia. A third Chili's is scheduled to open this week in Australia. Halpern said he expects to build 80 to 100 of the restaurants over the next five years in countries where Red Hot has exclusive rights. Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president of Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based restaurant consulting firm, said U.S. companies attempting to export the casual dining restaurant concept abroad need to pair up with well-established business partners in the host countries and cater to local cultural traditions. "You have to adapt to the local markets and pick good locations when you build franchises in overseas markets," he said. Abdallah's challenge will be bringing profitability to two-year-old Red Hot as it exports the casual-dining idea. In 1995 Red Hot Concepts generated $1.09 million in revenue but suffered a loss of $1.31 million. First-quarter 1996 figures for the public company show revenue of $1.55 million with a loss of $403,000. The losses reflect company start-up and development costs, Halpern said. "The restaurant business is a fairly capital-intensive business. To build a restaurant in {Britain}, it costs roughly $1.2 million to $1.4 million." Red Hot raised $6 million in August 1995 in an initial public offering on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company's stock, traded under the symbol RHCS, closed Friday at $3.12 1/2, down slightly from its high of $3.37 1/2 the day before. In the quarter ended June 30, the company reported a loss of $888,345, compared with a loss of $150,957 for the same period a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter was $2.2 million, compared with $13,016 a year ago. Abdallah has moved to restructure the company's British operations by installing a new operations chief in the London headquarters and rewriting the strategic plans for the market in Britain. He said the company is conducting focus group tests to improve Chili's brand-name recognition in Britain. Under consideration is a name change for the restaurants in Britain: from Chili's Grill & Bar to Chili's Texas Grill, the name used in Australia. Along with overseeing the construction of a new home for his family in Frederick, Md., Abdallah will spend the next several months traveling between Britain and Australia. In the first two weeks on the job, he traveled to England and Australia, and he was scheduled to attend today's opening of the company's newest restaurant in Ringwood, Australia, a suburb of Melbourne. "When I was in England over a week ago, it really hit me that this job will be the greatest challenge I've had in my career," he said. NORMAN J. ABDALLAH Age: 33 Position: President, Red Hot Concepts Inc. of Bethesda Previous: Vice president of franchise operations and development at Brinker International Inc. of Dallas. Personal: Married with two sons, ages 7 and 12. Education: Studied business administration at East Texas State University.
