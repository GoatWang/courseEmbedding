Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SunEdison Semiconductor First Quarter Results. At this time, all phone lines are in listen-only mode. Later on, there will be an opportunity for a question-and-answer session, with instructions given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded.
And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Chris Chaney. Please go ahead.
Chris Chaney
Thank you, Nick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining SunEdison Semiconductor’s first quarter 2016 results conference call. As Nick mentioned, I am Chris Chaney, Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Shaker Sadasivam, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Hall, our Chief Financial Officer. After my remarks, Shaker will provide an overview of the significant events and commentary on the Company’s performance, and Jeff will then give a review of the financial results.
Our discussion today will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation has been provided in our earnings press release financials published yesterday. Please note that this call may contain – also contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s current expectations.
Further information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ from management’s expectations are provided in our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC this morning and also available on our website. In addition, this call includes only information available to us at this time. So, to the extent you are listening to this call at a later date via a replay, please note that information may be outdated or incomplete. The Company disclaims, however, any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
With that being said, I’ll now turn the call over to Shaker.
Shaker Sadasivam
Thanks, Chris. Good morning. Thank you all for joining the conference call today. We continue to execute well, with our revenue up modestly from the prior quarter, and our cash position declined slightly to $80 million at the end of the first quarter. In my prepared remarks last quarter, I commented on us building good momentum with leading edge design wins on products for advanced nodes and for new products with our customers.
As a validation of my comments, we received a $34 million customer deposit this quarter, which will be used to invest in related production capabilities. This investment will fund new leading edge production capability in our Korean facility. This customer believes our newest products have the best performance in the process and would like us to ship a higher mix of these wafers for the advanced products. This improvement in mix is expected to increase the profitability of our Korean operation starting in 2017.
For the quarter, our factory utilization was about 90%, especially for 300 millimeter, which is higher than that for 200 millimeter. Pricing, as always, remains competitive. However, given the tightening supply demand picture in 300 millimeter, inventories at seasonal levels and the strengthening yen, we hope the competitive landscape becomes more disciplined.
With respect to our cost improvement plans, we continue to be on schedule to close our Ipoh, Malaysia facility end of September and to transfer all this manufacturing capacity to our factory in Italy. As a result of strong execution from our teams, we expect to exceed the EBITDA benefits related to the Ipoh closure we forecasted earlier. We will be in a better position to provide further details later in the year.

Now switching topics. We have received many questions regarding the recent Chapter 11 filing of our former parent, SunEdison, Inc. As you know, we separated from them in a public offering nearly two years ago. And since then, we have been a fully independent company. As such, we are not a party to the Chapter 11 filing. As you also know, they were our primary source of polysilicon in the past. Over the past 12 to 18 months, we have been making changes to our crystal processes to allow the use of multiple forms of poly, including both chunk and granular. This enhances our flexibility to use poly from a wider variety of sources.
We have not been buying polysilicon from SunEdison since year-end, and we believe we are positioned to procure all the poly we need from other sources at good prices. Our polysilicon supply chain is as strong as it has ever been. In conclusion, we continue to execute well and improve our market position. Our cash position and current coverage are also good. The review of strategic options we announced in February continues, and there is nothing new to report today. At this time, we remain committed to meeting our long-term business profitability targets. Our unique global footprint with facilities located next to our biggest customers, our industry-leading technologies in epi and SOI, and our strong focus on operational execution, all position us well.
Now, I will turn it over to Jeff, who will go through our Q1 results in more detail.
Jeff Hall
Thank you, Shaker. Overall, we executed a solid quarter in a market that, while strengthening remained tough. Revenue rose modestly, as higher volume more than offset slight price erosion. Gross margin was basically flat. And, as Shaker said, we received a $34 million customer deposit, validating our strength on leading-edge technologies. Revenue for the quarter was $182.3 million, up slightly compared to the prior quarter. The slight increase was driven by higher unit volumes of 300 millimeter wafers, which were partially offset by lower average pricing, mostly in epi.
The foundry-driven inventory correction appears to be behind us, and we are seeing positive signs in this segment again. Pricing for other product categories was basically flat. Gross profit was $15 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter, as increases in volume, lower depreciation and amortization, and manufacturing efficiencies offset headwinds from SX and SunEdison-related charges.
SG&A and R&D totaled $26.3 million for the first quarter. This was up $1.6 million or 6.5% sequentially, as spending increased from Q4 levels, but still well below prior-year’s 8% down. Interest expense was $4 million for the first quarter, down $7.5 million compared to the prior quarter, which included $3 million of non-recurring expenses related to refinancing, as I discussed on our last call.
First quarter 2016 interest expense now reflects the new lower interest rate on the Korean won-denominated financing we closed last year. EBITDA was $20.1 million, down $3.6 million sequentially to a 11.6% of sales from 13% of sales in the prior quarter as a result of higher operating expenses and lower depreciations. In May, the SMP poly facility in Korea filed an application for rehabilitation under Korean law, which is similar to reorganization under U.S. bankruptcy law.
The uncertainties resulting from this filing and the Chapter 11 filing of SunEdison, SMP’s largest investor and customer – triggered an interim impairment analysis, resulting in the recording of an $86.9 million other than temporary impairment charge in the quarter. This impairment charge is recorded in equity and loss of equity mechanism investments in our consolidated statement of operations. As a result of this impairment, our equity investment in S&P is now recorded on our balance sheet at zero value.

Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $11 million, down from $21.8 million in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of changing and working capital in the prior quarter. CapEx for the first quarter was $41 million. As Shaker described in his comments, we received a $34 million deposit from a customer to fund increased capability that will allow us to ship a higher mix of leading-edge wafers to this customer, which we expect to increase profitability starting in 2017.
About $18 million of this deposit was used in the first quarter, offsetting a large portion of our first quarter CapEx spend. The remainder of the deposit is reflected on our balance sheet in other long-term assets, and we plan to spend it over the course of this year. The deposit will be credited against the wafer shipments over three years, beginning in Q1 of 2018, and is specifically excluded from all debt covenant calculations. Despite the sequentially higher first quarter CapEx, our cash balance decreased only $3.8 million to $79.7 million from $83.5 million in the prior quarter, as we continue to manage our cash, taking advantage of our strong market position and product portfolio when opportunities arise.
Earlier this year, we announced our Board of Directors has authorized a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives following the receipt of unsolicited preliminary indications of interest in the Company. We do not have an update or timeline at this point, but we’ll issue updates as appropriate. And, as you might expect, we are unable to provide additional comments on this topic today. As I have mentioned before, our top priorities in operating the business are to continue growing EBITDA by executing on margin improvement initiatives, including factory consolidation, improving mix, trying to drive price increases, and balancing our CapEx spend with our sources of cash.
Thank you for joining us today and we’ll now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari
Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. The first one is on pricing. You guys talked about inventory being seasonal and how the appreciation of the Japanese yen could potentially lead to more discipline at your competitors. Based on that, what’s kind of your outlook in terms of pricing for both 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter going into Q2 and perhaps going into the back-half as well?
Shaker Sadasivam
Hey, Toshiya, this is Shaker.
Toshiya Hari
Hi.
Shaker Sadasivam
Sorry, did you want to say something?
Toshiya Hari
No, no, please.
Shaker Sadasivam
Okay. So in my prepared remarks, we talk about 300 millimeter supply demand getting tight again. And we are in a similar situation in the first half of 2015. And it weakened some in the second half, but our customers continue to add capacity, whereas I don’t really see suppliers adding any meaningful capacity. So it is going to tighten as you look forward. But unfortunately, what we see is that the competitors seem to have lost the pricing muscle memory.
The industry used to – as supply tightened, the typical cycle we’ve followed was increased pricing. And as demand decreased and supply exceeded demand, the pricing would go down. But that that behavior has completely been forgotten, and it’s important that the industry regains the pricing muscle memory. And we expect the demand to continue to stay tight if the market demand does stay strong. And there’s a good opportunity if the competitive landscape stays disciplined while price increases in the second half.
Toshiya Hari
Okay. So is it fair to say that base case pricing is flattish in Q2 and into the back half? Or could there be a scenario where you could actually see a pricing increase in the back half? Or too early, is that…

Shaker Sadasivam
We don’t specifically give forecast, but what I will say is we are not as bearish as what maybe some of the other comments have been out there in terms of pricing expectations.
Toshiya Hari
Okay, thank you. And quickly, as my follow-up, I had a question on CapEx as well. So you spent about $41 million in Q1, and I appreciate that you had received a deposit from your customer to partially pay for that $41 million. But I was wondering what the new steady-state is for you guys in terms of CapEx going forward? I think you had spent somewhere between $20 million and $30 million per quarter over the past couple of years. Is the $41 million a one-off number? Or are we kind of in a new steady-state? Thank you.
Jeff Hall
Yes, well, we certainly don’t think $40 million is steady-state, just to make that clear. The way I look at Q1 is, you’ve got to subtract from the $41 million the approximately $18 million that we spent on – related to the specific customer deposit, which we look at as a great investment for us. We’ve got a customer that loves how our product is yielding. They think it’s the best they’ve seen. As a result, they want us to increase the mix for them and drive a higher mix of that leading-edge product.
And they are willing to put their money where their mouth is by basically giving us the capital, essentially five years, for use of money to drive a profitability improvement product – project for us that also is going to increase theirs. So it’s a great case of win-win in that case. So I subtract that from the $40 million – that gets me to about $23 million of CapEx. We said that in a normal environment, we think $70 million to $80 million is what we’ve been running, and that we manage that kind of up or down, depending on balancing it with our uses of – sources of cash and with the ability to invest in high ROI projects.
We’ve said it was a little higher than that over 2015 as a result of spending on SOI, which is certainly coming to an end. And I think in general, you see that CapEx tends to be a little bit more frontend-loaded. So we continue to as we look forward trying to balance our sources and uses of cash with CapEx, but certainly would not think that $40 million is the new run rate. You’d have to subtract the prepayment CapEx from that.
Toshiya Hari
Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Shaker Sadasivam
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong
Thank you much. So on the question of cash, your cash and equivalents balance – I think it was $70 million – nearly $80 million – do you have any plans to boost that balance above anything that might come in from operation and cash flows? Are there any other sources of cash that you are looking into?
Jeff Hall
We have no plans today, David, to do anything to raise cash other than through operations. As we’ve said many times, our goal is to drive EBITDA growth. We think we have a lot of good opportunities to do that. We’re happy with how we’re executing on those priorities. And, as EBITDA grows, the cash is going to go along with it. Right now, no other plans.
David Wong
Right. And, Jeff, do you have a minimum number for cash and equivalents that you are comfortable with? What can that drop to and still be okay? And when would you actually take some action to boost the balance?
Jeff Hall
It’s always hard to be specific on a question like that. I think, on one hand, you can never have enough cash, but on the other hand, you’ve got to balance how you invest that and what kind of returns you make. We feel good with the levels we have today. And, as I said, we don’t have any plans to go out and raise capital at this point.
David Wong
Okay and one final clarification. So, the customer deposit you mentioned, you put the balance of that in long-term assets, and that can be used for some form of CapEx. Are there any other parts of your other assets balance on your balance sheet that are essentially cash, which you can use for CapEx or any other types of cash expenses?

Jeff Hall
No, is the simple answer to that.
David Wong
Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So let me start out with a clarification. Given the impairment charges that you have to record for S&P, do you still plan to procure a majority of polysilicon from SunEdison at the contracted price when the facility is up and running? Or is that plan completely suspended? And if you do decide to procure from other sources, do you still expect the price to be competitive compared to if you were to buy from SMP down the road?
Shaker Sadasivam
So in terms of what we have done pretty since the IPO in the last 12 to 18 months has significantly improved our flexibility to use alternative sources of polysilicon. And where we are today is we have the capability to use any one of the industry standard electronic grade polysilicon suppliers. And the way we are managing our own polysilicon supply situation is we’ve built sufficient inventory of granular polysilicon to last us well through 2016 and some into 2017.
And we have also secured supply agreements with key electronic grade polysilicon suppliers to take care of our supply. And from a pricing perspective, there is some headwind, but we hope to mitigate a lot of it through cost reduction actions and the factory consolidation actions we are taking. But generally, the team has done a good job of negotiating good prices for us on the polysilicon contracts that they have gone to from upsell. And SMP today is no more a viable alternative.
Sidney Ho
Okay, that’s clear. Maybe a longer-term question. You have a semiconductor market growth seems to have kind of stalled with smartphones growing slower and PCs actually declining for a few years now. And those two markets account for roughly 50% of wafer demand. Understanding no one is building new wafer capacity, but does that actually make sense to start cutting unproductive assets? And kind of related to that, is there any other facilities, other than at Ipoh, that you currently operate, has suboptimal cost structure? And is it a possibility to convert some of them to SOI facility where the pricing and profitability probably is better?
Shaker Sadasivam
I think if you could clarify your comments about cutting productive, are you talking about us cutting product capacity or…
Sidney Ho
Yes, you, but also the industry as a whole, but more focused mainly on you.
Shaker Sadasivam
Yes, you know if you look at the industry in terms of supply demand and utilization perspective, where there is really weakness is in 150 millimeter, but 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter continue to be strong and our customers are adding incremental capacity, definitely more capacity than what’s being added by the silicon wafer supplier. So I don’t really see a real opportunity for taking away productive capacity either for us or from a competitive perspective, as long as they feel like they have the right profitability.
And for us the Ipoh consolidation, like we have talked about before, is really taking two subscale factories and creating one scale factory to achieve the profitability that we want to achieve on our long-term profitability. And we continue to do the same with that other factory – there is really no further consolidation plan. We’re just improving the profitability of existing facilities to get to the 20% to 25% long-term goal that we’ve talked about in terms of EBITDA.
Sidney Ho
Great and if I could squeak in one more question. With the yen and the won both strengthening lately, how should we think about the impact on you? Is there like a rule of thumb to help us think about – for example, a 10% move equates to roughly a certain impact in gross margin, operating margin?

Jeff Hall
It’s hard to be that precise because really I would say the impact is two-fold. Obviously, we have operations in Japan and Korea. So, as kind of a first order, there is some headwind from those currencies strengthening as a result of conversion of those costs. But that’s a smaller impact, quite frankly. We saw the same thing in reverse last year right where we have a tailwind from those currencies devaluing, but in our view, that was more than offset by the price reductions it allowed our competitors in Japan to take. So we look at it, what Shaker said earlier, is yes, we’ve got a little bit of a headwind; we’re working hard to mitigate that, but what we’re – if we wanted to be optimistic about it, we would say that the strengthening of those currencies is going to help us significantly in a pricing standpoint.
Sidney Ho
Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.
Shaker Sadasivam
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go now to Jagadish Iyer with Redstone.
Jagadish Iyer
Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have one clarification and two questions. So first on the SMP joint venture, I just wanted to clarify should we anticipate no more polysilicon from that? In the event that this asset is being taken over by somebody, do you think that you guys can get your percentage of stake in terms of cash from that venture? And then I have two questions, please.
Jeff Hall
Yes. So, as we said, at this point, we do not expect to source any poly – we’re not counting on any sourcing any polysilicon from SMP. We’re comfortable with both the inventory we have and the changes we’ve made to our process to allow different forms that we’re comfortable we can get the poly we need from other sources. The fact that we wrote it down to zero – I would look at that as – that’s purely an accounting-based decision. There’s a bunch of uncertainty related to the SunEdison bankruptcy.
There’s also uncertainty – they are the biggest shareholder, the biggest customer. There is not an lot of uncertainty of the rehabilitation filing of SMP. So as we looked at those two uncertainties and the fact that we are not expecting to source polysilicon from it, we felt like the best answer from an accounting standpoint was to write the asset down to zero. Whether we’ll be able to realize some value from that in the future or whether they will be able to get it up in production remains uncertain, quite frankly. Certainly, if they’re able to produce poly and it meets our spec and it’s a good price, we would be happy to use it.
Jagadish Iyer
That’s helpful. So Shaker, you talked about the pricing situation for 2016. How should we think about volumes as we progress through the year?
Shaker Sadasivam
You know…
Jagadish Iyer
For both 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter.
Shaker Sadasivam
I don’t want to give any forecast, but if look at just the silicon wafer volumes year-on-year, typically the growth has been more robust than the revenue. For example, 2013 to 2014, the unit growth was closer to about 11% to 12%; 2014 to 2015, it was in the other 4% to 5%, so typically unit growth is a lot less cyclical and a lot more robust than revenue growth. So I would say from a units perspective, relative to what the revenue forecasts are – because a lot of it is covered by what’s happening with pricing and memory et cetera, unit growth should be much better than what industry revenue forecasts are.
Jagadish Iyer
Fair enough. And also can you just guys let us know what the SOI sales were in the first quarter? And how should we think about SOI sales for 2016 versus 2015? Thank you.
Shaker Sadasivam
So, Jagadish, for SOI definitely had a strong year last year with significant double-digit growth year-on-year and we expect a similar growth in 2016. We are not breaking it out in 2016 for competitive reasons, but the market continues to be strong. And even though smartphone sales have slowed down, the amount of content tied to SOI is still strong. And so we expect it to continue to be a good growth opportunity for our business.

Jagadish Iyer
Would it be fair to say that they could be 10% of your sales this year?
Shaker Sadasivam
Yes, about.
Jagadish Iyer
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Shaker Sadasivam
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, speakers. At this time, there are no further questions in queue.
Shaker Sadasivam
Okay, thank you. Thank you all for joining the call. So to summarize the quarter, I’d like to say we have continued to execute well and improve our market position. We’re also making good progress with our factory consolidation plans that will add incremental $30 million to our EBITDA starting in 2018 with $15 million of that coming in 2017. And with that, I turn it back to Chris.
Chris Chaney
Thank you, Nick. And please give the instructions for the redial and everyone thank you for joining our call today. Have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Direct of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Chaney. Please go ahead, sir.Chris ChaneyThank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you all for joining SunEdison Semiconductor’s fourth quarter 2014 results conference call. I am Chris Chaney, Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Shaker Sadasivam, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer.After my remarks, Shaker will provide an overview of the significant events and commentary on the Company’s fourth quarter performance and Jeff will then review the financial results. Our discussion today will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures has been provided in our earnings press release financials published earlier last night.Please note that this call may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. In addition, this call includes only information available to us at this time. To the extent that you are listening to this call and/or later day via a replay please note that the information may be outdated or incomplete. The Company disclaims however any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.With that, I’d like to now turn the call over to Shaker.Shaker SadasivamThanks Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining our conference call. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. While revenue for the fourth quarter was down following a stronger second and third quarter, demand held up better than last year. And we continue to make good progress on our key goal of improving profitability.Unit volumes were essentially flat for the quarter but average pricing was lower compared to last quarter due to customer and product mix. Despite lower revenue we grew our EBITDA sequentially. We reduced operating expenses, continue to drive operational improvements in our factories and generated positive operating cash flow.Our 300 millimeter factories continue to operate close to full capacity and 200 millimeter utilization increased in the quarter. Our view remains that the continued tightness in the 300 millimeter market and some segments of the 200 millimeter market will lead to price increases in 2015 and we are continuing our efforts to raise prices.While we see signs of improved pricing, we do not see meaningful increases at this point and expect lower pricing to continue in the first half of 2015 despite our efforts to raise prices. Improved pricing is an important step to meet our goals and to allow us to continue investing in R&D and the capacity needs of our customers. We made rapid progress in SOI during the fourth quarter. Our volumes grew 20% sequentially and our capacity's fully booked for the remainder of the year. We continue to see high interest in our SOI capabilities and expect to complete a significant capacity expansion in the first half of this year to serve demand.Earlier this year, we received the Best Partner Award from Samsung, one of our largest customers. This award is presented to the supplier that provides the most outstanding products and service. 2014 was the second time in the last three years that we have received this award. Also, in October we were awarded the Preferred Supplier Award from Infineon in recognition of outstanding supplier performance in the front-end material wafer category. I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers for this recognition and our employees whose dedication and hard work enabled these achievements. 2014 was a transition year for our business. We went public in May, concluded a three year long-term agreement with Samsung to grow our business, secured new business opportunities and SOI in other product segments and improved our EBITDA margins by 20%. We remain focused on improving the profitability of the business by delivering high quality value added and leading edge products that allow us to raise our prices and improve our mix. We believe our unique global footprint with facilities located next to our biggest customers, our industry leading technologies in EPI and SOI and our strong focus on operational execution and cost all position us well. Now I will turn it over to Jeff who'll go through our Q4 results in more detail.Jeff HallThank you, Shaker. Q4 was another solid quarter for us. EBITDA grew 8% despite 3% lower revenue, SOI demand continued to grow and our capacity is now fully booked through 2015. Cash from operations was $8.9 million and we beat the flash numbers we provided in early January. Before I get into the details, I’d like to take a moment to thank our outstanding finance team who were able to get us these flash numbers at year end in only seven days. Thank you.Revenue for the quarter was $205.9 million, down 3.4% compared to the prior quarter. This decline was primarily the result of lower pricing as demand remained strong, but our mix was skewed towards lower end products. Rapidly growing and higher ASP products such as EPI and SOI are expected to improve our sales mix later this year.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

Thanks, Chris and thank you all for joining the call this morning. I would like to begin by highlighting some of the key areas where we made good progress in 2015. First, we successfully completed a partial refinancing of our debt, lowering future interest payments, enhancing our capital structure flexibility and improving covenant coverage.
We also maintain closed to a flat position on cash throughout the year, while making significant investments in SOI and enhancing factory capability to make advanced products. And finally we improved our gross margin and EBITDA margins year on year, despite tough market conditions into second half of 2015.
Turning now to the fourth quarter, our revenues were down sequentially driven by market weakness, impacting volumes of smaller diameter wafers and pricing in general. Although our total volume were sequentially lower, our overall utilization is high and our 300 millimeter utilization continues to be over 90%.
Our fourth quarter EBITDA margins grew with to 13% from 12.8% in the prior quarter due to good controls of our marketing and administration and R&D expense. We are continuing to make good progress with our previously announced closure of our Ipoh, Malaysia facility and they transfer of this manufacturing capacity to our factory in Italy.

We expect to see meaningful benefit to our EBITDA following the closure. We have a high degree of confidence in our estimates of a $15 million benefit in 2017 and an incremental benefit of another $15 million into 2018. That is an annual EBITDA benefit of $30 million per year starting in 2018.
I would also like to highlight the work we have done since our IPO in May 2014 to secure our polysilicon supply chain. We have improved our manufacturing flexibility to use various types of electronic grade polysilicon while also diversifying a supply base. Also, this year we will begin to qualify polysilicon from SMP our joint venture in Korea.
With all these actions we believe that the recent announcement from SunEdison on closing the polysilicon plant in Texas will have little to no impact for our poly supply. Actually, our poly contingency plan is a best it has ever been. And as I highlighted in my opening comments, we've finished the quarter pretty close to flat on cash and completed refinancing a portion of our debt.
I strongly feel that we are much better positioned today across the entire business, financial, operations, customer positioning and research and development compared to where we were at the same time last year. We continue to build good momentum with design wins on products for advanced nodes and for new product with our customers.
A few weeks ago, we announced that we were beginning the process of evaluating a range of strategic alternatives, which include among other things a merger or sale of the company or continuing to pursue our existing operating and growth plan. We have talked consistently about a need for industry consolidation, we continue to believe this makes sense with the right partner.
While we evaluate these options, we remain committed to executing to our current business plan and making good progress in 2016 towards our long-term EBITDA margin goals of 20% to 25%. We believe our unique global footprint with facility located next to our biggest customers, our industry leading technologies at FE and SOI and our strong focus on operational execution and cost all position us well.
Now, I will turn it over to Jeff, who will go through our Q4 and year-end results in more detail.
Jeffrey L. Hall
Thank you, Shaker. Overall, a better sales mix and tough expense management helped us to execute a good quarter despite the difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter. We were able to mostly offset a 3.9% decline in revenue with better product mix and tough decisions on SG&A and R&D expenses.
As a result, our EBITDA declined only $400,000 and our EBITDA margin grew from 13% from 12.8% in the prior quarter. In addition, we were able to refinance a portion of our debt, lowering our interest expense while significantly improving our flexibility and covenant coverage.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $181.7 million down 3.9% compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of lower volumes of smaller diameter wafers combined with slightly weaker pricing. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $15.1 million or 8.3% of revenue, down sequentially primarily due to lower pricing volume. Full-year gross margin grew to 9.9% in 2015 compared to 9.4% in 2014 despite a 7.5% decline in revenue, as we were able to offset price erosion with manufacturing cost reductions.
SG&A and R&D total $24.7 million for the fourth quarter down about $2 million after excluding the $2.8 million pension charge in the third quarter. This is an addition to the $2 million reductions in operating expenses we achieved in Q3. For the full-year, we reduced SG&A and R&D cost by about 7% compared to 2014.
EBITDA for the quarter was $23.7 million or 13% of revenue compared to $24.1 million and 12.8% in the prior quarter. For the full-year, EBITDA was $103.6 million up 12.2% despite to 7.5% decline in revenue. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $21.8 million, up from $8.4 million in the prior quarter, as a result of improvements in working capital.

CapEx for the fourth quarter was $23.5 million down from the $29.9 in the third quarter. For the full-year, our CapEx totaled $106.3 million and we made significant investments in leading edge products. As I mentioned earlier, we successfully refinanced a portion of our debt through a prepayment of our U.S. denominated term loan. Using fund from a new loan facility in Korea the nominated in Korean Won.
The new debt carries a lower interest which will save us about $1 million annually in interest expense. In addition, the new debt allows for better currency matching, enhances our capital structure flexibility and improves our covenant coverage. As part of the refinancing process, we also improved the definition of indebtedness and now exclude unfunded letters of credit.
Debt to EBITDA under the new calculation was well below our covenant of 2.5 times in Q4. Interest expense was $7.5 million for the fourth quarter include two non-recurring expenses related to the refinancing. $1.4 million pre-payment premium and $1.6 million from the write-off of unamortized deferred loan cost and discounts. Our cash balance decreased $7.3 million in the quarter to $83.5 million from $90.8 million in the prior quarter. For the full-year, cash declined $4.7 million despite spending $103 million on CapEx.
As Shaker said earlier, on February 18, we announced our Board of Directors has authorized the process to explore a range of strategic alternatives. Following the recite unsolicited preliminary indications of interest in the company. We do not have an update or timeline at this point, but we will issue update as appropriate. And as you might expect we are unable to entertain questions or provide additional comments on this topic today.
As I have mentioned before, our top priorities are to continue to grow EBITDA by executing on the margin improvement initiatives we have, including factory consolidation, improving mix and trying to drive pipe increases. Driving industry consolidation and balancing our CapEx spend with our sources of cash.
Thank you for joining us today and we will now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Our first question today comes from a line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho
Thanks for taking my questions. I understand there is a little bit of amount you can talk about the strategic alternatives, but the idea of consolidation has been out there for while. Just curious why you choose now to disclose the discussion? And related to that do you think there is anything you can do internally from a manufacturing or Op expense point that can help improve your position in these negotiations?
Jeffrey L. Hall
Sure, I said a few minutes ago, the reason we disclosed discussion now is because we received two indication of interest on solicited. Are there things we can do? Of course there are things we can do, we are aggressively managing our costs, we are driving towards EBITDA targets, we got an aggressive factory consolidation initiatives underway that Shaker said is going to save us $15 million in 2017 and $30 million a year starting in 2018. We are driving our business to grow an FE and SOI. We are working on price increases, we continually focus on taking cost out of OpEx. So we are working very hard to improve our business overall.
Sidney Ho
Okay great. My follow-up question is that there are some constrains that your former parent company may have some liquidity issues. Can you walk us through your thoughts if that does happen, what it means to your equity stake in SMP? And what is the impact on your long-term poly agreement with SMP. Is there any clause in the supply agreement that protects you guys? And lastly, is there like a change of control provision in supply agreement?

Jeffrey L. Hall
Overall, as we talked about related to SMP in poly, since our IPO, we've been working very hard to improve our contingency plans in the rate of poly. And as Shaker said, we feel our contingency plans are better today than they have the ever been in the past. So we feel pretty good about that. In the supply agreement, if we end up using supply other than SunEdison or SMP, we are confident that we will be able to negotiate prices that approximate the pricing to get there. So we feel good about our contingency plan and feel good about the ongoing ability to operate in our business.
Sidney Ho
Thanks, so much.
Operator
And we do have a question from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
David Wong
Thanks very much. In the quarters what will your CapEx run rate be?
Jeffrey L. Hall
We have sense specific about forward guidance on CapEx as we continue to say we are focused on balancing our sources and uses of cash. We achieved this balance pretty well in 2015 as we are only used 4.7 of cash while investing about 106. Historically run rates about $80 million spent higher recently due to the spending on SOI. If we felt like we need to take CapEx down to keep the balance of cash, we could come well below the $80 million number.
The other side of that is if we got more pre-payments or cash in from customers to fund specific capability initiatives, then CapEx could go up. So we are trying to keep our flexibility open, we've got a pretty wide range of possibilities, but really the top goal for us is to balance sources of cash with uses of cash while continuing to grow the profitability of our business.
David Wong
Great and do you expect to reduce operating expenses rather other from the December quarter levels or what we see in December reflects your cost cutting efforts?
Jeffrey L. Hall
Yes, I don't see a lot more downward possibility, I actually said the same thing back in Q3 and we managed to squeeze a little more out in Q4. So I don't think there is a lot more downward possibility. We feel reasonable at these levels, every year as you crossover year-end, there is always upward pressure on OpEx that as a management team you got to go in and try to overcome the effect of inflation and et cetera.
So we're working hard on that right now, trying to see if we can hold at these levels, we think we can at this level, if we saw pricing increase or revenue increase, there might be a little bit of upward pressure, but I don't think there is lot of downward possible at this point.
David Wong
Great. Thanks, my final question, I mean, putting all of that together from what you see a current business and expense trends, do you expect net debt will grow over the next few quarters or will you be able to hold it at the current levels?
Jeffrey L. Hall
It's hard to comment specifically on that without having forward guidance out there, right, I mean, the headwinds and tailwinds of the business. As we go through that we will continue to manage our business and really as I said our focus is balanced.
David Wong
Great, thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Redstone. Please go ahead.
Jagadish Iyer
Shaker, what is your best estimate for MSI growth this year for the industry and how should we think specifically for SunEdison SEMI in terms of MSI growth for this year, given what all has happened last year. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that?
Shaker Sadashivam
Okay. We don't do our own internal forecasting for the markets, so we pretty much rely on forecasts that you look at and you definitely have a better angle on those, but just in terms of how we are looking at the market for 2016. Look at to a primary thing, one is our general view of the market, and two is our positioning in the market that is with respect to customers. And as we look into 2016, we feel comfortable about both, both our positioning of customers and we feel comfortable with how the market is shaping up so far. So I would leave it at that.

Jagadish Iyer
Okay. So just generally and this is might be even relevant for Jeff as well. So I just wanted to understand, how do you manage in terms of the pricing situation here, because three of your competitors have a favorable currency on their back. So how should we think about the FX impact on pricing as we look at the next couple of quarters and also some thoughts on general. I know you laid out something, but I wanted to get your thoughts on how the volume pricing dynamics is going to play out, particularly if there is going to be still the U.S. dollar is going to be stronger?
Shaker Sadashivam
I think so far what we've seen is that the pricing is - I mean the foreign exchange advantage for our key competitive has definitely been a headwind for the pricing in general for the industry, because from a supply demand perspective 300 millimeter has really been at capacity and in some cases at quarters where demand has exceeded capacity.
So we were actually expecting price increases in 2015 didn't play out, if the market and like I said before, stay strong in the first half of 2016 and when we go into negotiation with second half, it definitely puts us in a better position.
And I think there has been some weakening or strengthening in the Yen recently which should help and I think everybody uniformly has been talking about wanting to increase pricing in order to be able to justify investment. Currently with the current pricing, it doesn't make sense for any of us, any of the competitors even with the weakening currency to make investments in capacity and our customers are continuing to add capacity. So the situation from a supply and demand perspective should only get worse.
And I think first step there would be all of us has discipline, prices go up and go up sufficiently for us to be able to just by adding capacity, but we will be careful about from our perspective very careful in how we add capacity and our [indiscernible].
Jagadish Iyer
Okay. Finally, just wanted to understand this better, why can’t you completely liquidate your position in SMP and get the cash if the polysilicon market seems to be reasonably stable in your opinion in terms of pricing? So why can’t you just get out of there completely of the SMP and get the cash from that so that you can make that strategic investments that you need going forward? Thank you.
Jeffrey L. Hall
We did as we said, we sold a portion of our investment, we did comment in the K which I'm sure most of you didn’t had a chance to read yet, but that transaction has now closed. We did received a third-party approval so we've closed on that sale. We would certainly be willing to consider additional sales of SMP, but obviously any sell takes a buyer on the opposite side. So we haven’t announced anything at this point and it's hard to really comment on any more detail than that.
Jagadish Iyer
Thank you.
Shaker Sadashivam
Thank you.
Operator
And we do have a question from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari
Hi good morning. My first question is regarding volume trends and pricing trends, could you maybe give us some idea as to have both volumes and pricing trended by different diameters in Q4? And what your outlook is for Q1 and perhaps Q2 and beyond?
Jeffrey L. Hall
Yes, so we don’t breakout volume changes by diameter, we think that’s getting too close to competitive information and we don’t really want to provide that level of detail to all of our competitors and customers. As Shaker said, volume remains tight, we saw some inventory correction in the back half of 2015 it now appears to us that inventory corrections over, we are seeing demands strengthen overall a little bit. And it looks pretty tight across certainly 300 and into 200, but other than that we don’t really comment specifically on that diameters.

Toshiya Hari
Okay thank you. My second question is regarding your strategy going forward, you mentioned in your prepaid remarks that industry consolidation would make sense with the right partner. Could maybe point to specific characteristics you would look for in a potential partner?
Jeffrey L. Hall
Well, I mean if you think about industry consolidation, I mean you look at just the overlap of what we do right. We all sell to the same customers, we all make the same product, we do a lot of the same research and development, and we do a lot of the same marketing.
So just by consolidating that we would see potential large synergy in OpEx. In addition, there is the potential to further optimize scale right, we look at the two bigger guys in our industry and they defiantly have scale benefits from being much larger that go beyond just OpEx. Buying more of the key supplies that we buy gives us more purchasing power.
So we think there is lots of synergy just from putting company together and getting to a bigger scale and it also gives us the bigger percentage of share with our customers to allow us to have better standing in those negotiations as well. So that’s the simple reason why we think it makes sense.
Toshiya Hari
Okay helpful. And finally is there is strict deadline at which you would inform us, your customer and your employees of your future plans. I ask because I’m sure the current situation adds a bit of uncertainty to I guess everyone?
Jeffrey L. Hall
No, there is no deadline. We going to work through it carefully and thoughtfully and make the right decision and when we are at a point to tell you more, we will tell you more, we may end up doing nothing, we may end up with other alternatives. So it's hard to say at this time.
Toshiya Hari
Very clear, thank you very much.
Shaker Sadashivam
Thank you.
Operator
And we do have a question from the line of Amanda Scarnati with Citi. Please go ahead.
Amanda Scarnati
Hi thanks for taking the questions. Just on order linearity throughout the quarter, we saw cuts [indiscernible] late in the quarter which impacted the suppliers and [indiscernible] supply chain. Did you see any sort of order follow-up towards the end of the quarter or your lead time, a little bit different where you would see more of a fall of this quarter instead of your fourth quarter? Thank you.
Shaker Sadashivam
We don’t get into detail on a monthly basis, but in general, majority of our volume and revenue for the quarter, we have a pretty good feel going in to the quarter. And there is not big changes once we know what the numbers are at the start of the quarter, but it's not a case where - there can be some minor changes in terms of ups and downs, but not significantly.
Amanda Scarnati
And then what are your typical lead times in terms of order to shipment?
Shaker Sadashivam
Order to shipment, we typically have a backlog and a forecast at the start of the quarter. And if demands come in beyond that to the quarter depending on how much open capacity we have, we can accommodate those with shorter lead times, but where we have to go do some adjustments to the mix that will take a longer lead time. So there is no - people where we have the backlog clearly book, it's done. And depending on capacity utilization it can affect the lead times for the rest of the demand that comers in.
Amanda Scarnati
And then you mentioned that mix was better this quarter, assuming then it would be [indiscernible] mix that was a little bit stronger, what has helped to kind of offset the weakness in 200 millimeter, is that the correct way of thinking that?
Shaker Sadashivam
Yes, so essentially the product mix you talk about is primarily FE and SOI. And we have talked about those two being key advantages for us and we continue to use that to leverage our mix and our pricing in the margins.

Amanda Scarnati
Great. Thank you.
Shaker Sadashivam
Thank you.
Operator
And we have a question from the line of Yoshi Azuma with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Yoshi Azuma
Hi Shaker, the first question regarding the China, do you have any plan to supply ingot or bare wafer to Chinese wafer manufacturer or like provide some technologies?
Shaker Sadasivam
Today we supply all the key customers and China.
Yoshi Azuma
No, no I’m talking about the supply ingot or bare wafer to Chinese wafer manufacturer not Chinese chip makers.
Shaker Sadasivam
Yes, I think it's pretty unlikely that we would supply work in process kind of material to Chinese wafering houses. And it’s probably even more unlikely that we would supply intellectual property to Chinese wafering guys.
Yoshi Azuma
Okay. Got it. The second question is regarded polysilicon, you mentioned that SMP going to produce polysilicon a semiconductor grade polysilicon, but as far as I know that SMP cannot produce semiconductor grade polysilicon. So now you are procuring polysilicon from [indiscernible] at a much cheaper cost than your competitors, from now on you cannot take advantage of a cheap polysilicon anymore in the future, is that correct?
Shaker Sadasivam
No, I would like to correct at misconception. SMP has actually got a better technology across the whole factory both the front end for making silane and also the back end with a crude bed reactors. And the factory is designed to also make semiconductor grade polysilicon, the silane actually will have purity, equivalent if not better than what we get at Pasadena and the reactors have higher productivity.
But in terms of quality, they have the same capability as Pasadena. So we already do have initial samples of semiconductor grade polysilicon from SMP and we have so design wise, it's designed for making some of the grades, we also have samples and technically it's a design for a much better technology than what we had Pasadena.
Jeffrey L. Hall
And I would say and as for a long-term supply we have a 10-year contract for polysilicon supply, which has pricing lower than we had in 2015 and continuing lower over the course of that 10-year contract. So we feel pretty good about that as well.
Yoshi Azuma
Let me go on with that 10-year contract with SMP?
Jeffrey L. Hall
A 10-year contract with SunEdison.
Yoshi Azuma
Okay. But the SunEdison is going to close all the polysilicon facilities, right or how can they procure or how can they provide you?
Jeffrey L. Hall
Through SMP.
Yoshi Azuma
Okay got it [indiscernible] so how can you make free cash flow into positive, your free cash flow has been negative for four years and this year is likely to be rough than last year given that the price already [indiscernible] and the volume probably roughly the same. I don't think to 200 millimeter, 300 millimeter SOI alone can increase cash flow by [indiscernible], so what is your game plan?
Jeffrey L. Hall
So, it's the things you have been talking about right, as we've got a factory consolidation and optimization project underway that's going to when complete have $30 million a year of free cash flow or sorry of EBITDA. We have the poly supply contract, I just talked about, we continue to drive manufacturing and OpEx efficiencies. Volume actually looks tighter now than it has been going forward. So we'll look at that, I think those are pretty good set of tailwinds.
Shaker Sadasivam
Yes and since you have gone through our IPO, even in tough market conditions, we've shown our ability to improve profitability and manage our cash. So I don't see any reason why, we cannot execute to the same level going forward and that's how we will execute.
Yoshi Azuma
But if you so confident that you can improve your free cash flow, why you are thinking about strategic alternatives?

Jeffrey L. Hall
Yes, it's what I have said, I think twice now on the call so far, which is the reason we're considering strategic alternatives, because we received unsolicited preliminary indications of interest from outside parties.
Yoshi Azuma
Okay. So it means that it is not your intention?
Jeffrey L. Hall
No, it means unsolicited.
Yoshi Azuma
Okay.
Jeffrey L. Hall
We have said, what our intention is at the end of the day. We've been talking about industry consolidations since our IPO that we think industry consolidation makes a lot of sense and can create a lot of value for the industry. The reason we are now talking about strategic alternatives publically is because we received indications of interest unsolicited and that made us feel like we needed to disclose that.
Yoshi Azuma
Okay got it, understood. Thank you.
Shaker Sadasivam
Thank you.
Operator
And we do have a follow-up question from Jagdish Iyer with Redstone. Please go ahead.
Jagdish Iyer
Thanks for taking the follow-up. A quick question Jeff or Shaker, how should we think about gross margins going into 2016, do you think that essentially your gross margins has troughed at Q4 and you should start to see some uptick graduals going through the rest of the year? Thank you.
Jeffrey L. Hall
Well I mean, unfortunately there is lot of moving parts, we can talk about headwinds and tailwinds, I just talked about a lot of the tailwinds we see, it's hard to anticipate is where pricing us going to go. We did a nice job, we think over the course of 2015 offsetting the negative price impact through manufacturing efficiencies, certainly that's our goal for next year and certainly we see a lot of tailwinds and we're working on a lot of initiatives, but it's impossible to predict where pricing would go. Although as we said earlier, we feel like the industry is very tight.
Jagdish Iyer
Thank you.

In order to reduce operational costs and maximize beer freshness, Anheuser-Busch InBev is constantly identifying new tracking technologies to help them stay on top of their shipments. Many carriers have their own digital portals showing the location and route of their trucks, but since ABI contracts with hundreds of different carriers, the time and complexity needed to manage shipment logistics requires a different solution.
As a result, they’ve developed an application that allows logistics managers to log into a single portal and see real-time tracking on all trucks.  Unlike other existing portals, ABI’s aggregates many different carriers’ data feeds in a single user interface. In addition to seeing where the trucks are, they can also see what routes they’ve taken to get there, the contents of each truck, and the estimated time of delivery. The application is available to wholesalers as well, allowing them to plan ahead for the unloading process.

The technology also allows ABI to utilize a tracking technology called “geofencing.” As soon as a truck crosses these virtual fences, a sensor pings their distribution centers and lets them know its exact location and the time it arrived at that location. It also gives them insight into their operational efficiency (i.e., how quickly the trucks are being unloaded and turned around).
By using these technologies, ABI is able to have greater visibility of its supply chain on a granular level. They can then take this information to identify the most efficient carriers and negotiate rates.
In the video above, Dan Hazlett and Matt Gordon of ABI describe some of the innovative technologies they are employing to improve the visibility of their payloads. This is a highlight of their presentation at the 2016 Boeing Center Industry Conference at Washington University.

Supply chain pros share expertise


October 22, 2015 by The Boeing Center 

Early morning sunlight bathed the stoic face of Knight Hall as action-oriented executives from diverse industries gathered at Washington University for the 7th annual Boeing Center for Technology, Information and Manufacturing (BCTIM) Industry Conference.  The theme was Supply Chains Disrupted:  Disruptive Technologies, New Business Models, and Operational Impact.  Executives from top companies in the region delivered presentations to quench the audience’s thirst for knowledge, and highly-skilled chefs from the Knight Center served delectable cuisine to sate its hunger.
Throughout the day, the angles of the shadows outside grew shorter, and then longer again, as theoretical and practical knowledge was transmitted between supply chain practitioners.  After a warm welcome address from Prof. Panos Kouvelis, the director of BCTIM, the attendees settled in for what would be a full day.
Tom Luft from Express Scripts kicked things off with a presentation about turning pharmaceutical manufacturer monopolies into commodities. John Vu talked about Belden’s expansion into strategic markets, inventory management improvements, and governmental regulations on the logistics industry. Mark Waight from Edward Jones spoke about how organized movement enables operational excellence in the service industry. Then, Prof. Kouvelis gave a special presentation explaining how effective risk management can foster innovation resulting in business model breakthroughs.

After lunch, Jeremy Soucek and Julien Marin-Couilloud discussed how Emerson manages risk in its own supply chain. Jim Kinnett went on to tell the audience about Monsanto’s journey through the creation and implementation of a digital supply chain, while Jeff Wieringa from Boeing described some disruptive technologies in the next generation of aircraft.
Finally, Chris Pickett impressed the crowd by explaining Anheuser-Busch InBev’s complex beer supply chain and logistical considerations.  All day long, pens feverishly scratched across notebooks in an attempt to capture the wisdom that can only be acquired from long years in operations management.

Garnishing ToolsFrom margaritas to lemon drops and myriad other cocktails, a salt- or sugar-rimmed glass is the perfect finish to an expertly crafted drink. With the right tools, you can elevate your mixed drinks from the ordinary to the extraordinary, giving your guests a professional-quality cocktail to enjoy with just the right garnish. Williams-Sonoma can help get you there with a collection of cocktail garnishing tools that you’ll find in fine restaurants and bars all over the world. Our product selections include elegant stainless-steel cocktail picks, which are a definite step up from an ordinary toothpick, and a professional cocktail rimmer that can allow you to put everything from kosher salt to cookie crumbs around the rim of a glass.Cocktail rimmers allow you to add small dry garnishes to the rim of a cocktail glass. This is a standard way of giving an extra dimension of flavor and texture to the lucky individual who gets to consume the drink inside the glass. The drinker’s lips will make direct contact with whatever you use to rim the glass, so it’s best to choose something that will enhance the flavor of your drink. You can use anything from herbed salt to fine, colored sugar or even sprinkles - anything that will taste good, enhance your presentation and impress your guests.Creativity is a major hallmark of modern bartending. If you have a well-stocked bar cart with all the right tools and liquors, don’t neglect your garnishes. Our reusable stainless-steel cocktail picks can add just the right touch to your drinks. While stuffed olives and cocktail onions are classic choices, modern bartenders are pushing the limits and introducing new garnishes to their drinks, much to their patrons’ delight. You can keep it simple by opting for a delicious Luxardo cherry garnish rather than the electric-red maraschino, or you can get creative and skewer everything from cubes of cured meat and pickles to stuffed jalapenos or mini kebabs of fruit and herbs.Our cocktail garnishing tools enable you to add extra color, flavor and texture to your mixed drinks. If you want to step beyond the traditional olive garnish for your regular martini, opt for a cocktail pick stacked with pickled peppers instead. Or, if you prefer a sweet drink, try rimming your glasses with flavored sugar before adding your shaken cosmo. These tools can help you expand your horizons and harness your bartending creativity, bringing your home bartending routine into a whole new dimension.

View All SaleWhether you’re in need of a new tea kettle, want to buy a new cookware set for your home or apartment or want some specialty cookware to try out some new recipes, everything you need is at Williams-Sonoma, from tabletop items to kitchen electrics, to stock your kitchen so you can make every meal memorable. If you need quite a few items but are worried about breaking your budget, you can view all sale and clearance items so you’re able to find the pieces you need without going over budget.One of the most important things about a well-stocked kitchen is its cookware and serveware. Having professional-grade, quality equipment that’s easy to clean and maintain can make so much of a difference when it comes to your joy of cooking. If you’re in need of necessities and staples, there is a wealth of items such as fry pans and skillets, braisers, Dutch ovens and more on sale so you can stock – or restock – your kitchen. Choose from durable materials that cook food evenly, such as stainless-steel or copper cookware. There are also many different stove-top items, like saucepans and frying pans, with nonstick surfaces. Easy to clean by hand, many of these pieces are also dishwasher safe to make cleaning up after a long night of cooking a breeze.Having a few specialty items at your disposal can make for some interesting and inventive meals. If you’ve grown a bit tired of making the same handful of meals every week, branch out and try something different. For instance, a pressure cooker allows you to make everything from steamed vegetables to full entrées to rice, while a stove-top pizza oven allows you to fire homemade pizza right on your stove top. A waffle maker is great for making memorable breakfasts, while a miniature outdoor grill lets you have a barbecue party right in your backyard. Or you can take a small, portable grill with you to the beach or park. Other handy gadgets to have around include popcorn poppers, stand mixers and espresso makers, for that perfect cup of joe.Having the right tools at your disposal can also make your cooking adventures more seamless. Look for an array of different cooks’ tools on sale to simplify your process, or add some more cutlery to your kitchen ensemble. Having the right knife to prepare certain foods means a lot if you need to julienne or dice. It’s also a good idea to stock up on baker’s tools or bakeware, even during the summer months. Whether you’re whipping up an apple pie for an outdoor barbecue or are thinking ahead to Thanksgiving, any time is a good time to bake.When it comes to your tabletop and bar, look for bright and cheerful tablecloths, runners and linen napkins to make any occasion that much more special. When it comes to your bar, think about stocking up on needed tools before the outdoor barbecue season hits. Having shakers, jiggers, ice tongs and other equipment helps you play bartender at every gathering. The right glassware also helps your cocktail party or formal dinner look elegant and professional.Beyond equipment and accessories, there are also many special offers when it comes to food as well. Look for entire entrées to treat dad on Father’s Day, or opt for freezer-to-table pastries to serve at your next gathering. Sauces, glazes and marinades also easily turn your backyard barbecue from blah to fantastic, while desserts and candies are great treats all year long. For your home, freshen up your space with specialty soaps, lotions and candles, allowing a pleasant breeze to infuse your space both day and night.

TableclothsSpruce up your dining decor and keep your table in tip-top condition. Linens such as tablecloths and table runners are as practical as they are stunning. Add a splash of color or a bold print to your dining area to transform the space from bland to beautiful. Protect wooden table surfaces from hot serving dishes, drips and spills. Williams-Sonoma features a great selection of designs and colors, from neutrals to vibrant prints. Our collections also include other linen essentials to mix and match with your tablecloth.Mixing and matching tablecloths with your other dining room decor can be fun and easy. To start, take stock of the other colors in the space. If your walls, furniture and curtains are neutral, you can choose nearly any color or print. If your walls or drapes feature a bold hue, you can opt for a print that picks up on one of the colors in the room or features a contrasting shade. White and neutral tablecloths work in virtually any space, so these are a safe option. Whites and neutrals work well in small kitchens and dining nooks, as they do not overwhelm smaller spaces.The occasion can also play a role in your color and print choice. White and neutral tablecloths are great choices for formal events, as they let the food and centerpieces play a central role in your tabletop decor. Prints and bright colors are appropriate for casual dining and everyday dinners, and they show off your personality when guests come over. Florals and country-inspired patterns work well with traditional decor schemes, whereas bohemian and geometric prints look great with contemporary room decor styles. You can also get festive with a holiday-inspired linen design when Halloween, Thanksgiving or winter rolls around.If you want to protect the surface of a wood table, consider adding a table pad underneath your linens. Pads are usually made from water-resistant materials, which help keep liquids away from your wood. A thick fabric, coasters and a few trivets can provide some additional protection.Tablecloths come in several different sizes, so measure your table before choosing new linens. Pair square cloths with round and square tables. If your table is rectangular, measure both the length and the width. The amount of drop over the edge depends on both your personal tastes and the occasion. Longer tablecloths lend a formal aesthetic to your dining area, so these work well for fancy dinner parties and special occasions. Shorter drops have a casual and easygoing look, and they tend to be more practical for everyday dining. If your table features unusual measurements, play around with different linens to decorate your table. Layer a square tablecloth diagonally over a rectangular one or get creative with table runners.To complete your tabletop design, add other linens to your decor. If you opt for a printed tablecloth, add solid napkins. Pick up on the colors in the cloth to create a cohesive design. Small prints can sometimes have the same effect as solid shades, so these can also work with printed tablecloths. If you choose a solid or neutral piece, add a table runner to bring some color to the table. Runners are narrow strips of fabric that run along the center of your table, so these work well for adding some personality without overwhelming your dining space. Printed place mats are also great for adding some accents to a neutral tablecloth.We offer plenty of tabletop accessories to complete your dining area. Although tablecloths offer some protection from spills and drips, they do not protect wood surfaces from heat. If you want to serve hot platters, serving dishes or saucepans on your table, add a few trivets for protection. Lazy Susans are useful accessories for family dinners and dinner parties. Simply add small platters or appetizers to the sides and spin it around to serve your delicious dishes to your guests. Choose serving bowls and platters in colors that pick up on the shades in your printed tablecloth. If your linens are neutral, choose dramatic hues to make your tabletop pop.

Dinnerware CollectionsNo matter the occasion, Williams-Sonoma has a dinnerware collection that fits your entertaining needs. Host a formal dinner party in your house with a full setup of place settings, or just have a couple of friends over for lunch using some classic plates, bowls and mugs. Our dinnerware collections give you coordinated options for serving guests so you can incorporate beautifully matched – or mismatched, if that’s your style – plates and bowls you love. Find a wide selection of colorful, patterned dinnerware collections, or go with a bold, solid color to let your food stand out.When the harvest season comes around, make sure you have a dinnerware collection to celebrate the special time of year and the food it brings. Plates that feature pumpkins, squash, sunflowers and heirloom tomatoes allow you to serve guests in style. These plates are also great to keep out on the dining room or kitchen table as pure decoration. Find plates made of high-fired porcelain that are durable and can stand up to many Thanksgiving meals. Plates that are microwavable let you easily reheat leftovers, while dishwasher-safe plates are easy to wash, especially if the kids are helping out with cleanup.For the modern household, find a dinnerware collection that features plates, platters and bowls that feature hand-painted black-and-white designs. Plates made of earthenware are durable, and designs are all unique. For the complete dinnerware collection, find a set that includes dinner and salad plates along with soup bowls and a platter for setting out the main course. Other modern designs include a festive Spanish-themed set made of glazed stoneware that can withstand temperatures of up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit in the oven, and a set with unique floral folk art that adds charm to the table.Not every fancy meal is one you have to eat around the dining room table. Take your party outdoors with a collection of outdoor dinnerware specifically made to handle the rigors of the elements in almost any season. Find a dinnerware set made of melamine that mimics the rich, glazed look of ceramic but resists chipping and wears beautifully. If you drop a melamine dish on the concrete of a patio or the wood of the deck, it resists shattering. These plates also resist scratching from rough outdoor surfaces. Melamine is safe to place in the dishwasher and is BPA free. Because melamine is made of 30 percent renewed bamboo fiber, it is a sustainable choice that helps you be more environmentally conscious too.A good white dinnerware collection works for every occasion, from weddings to breakfasts in bed. We offer several plain white collections that feature all of the essential items, including dinner plates, salad plates, saucers, cups and soup plates. Find a set made of high-fired porcelain for the classic dining experience. Plates are available in classic round shapes, while square plates make any meal a little more modern.Formal dinnerware collections take all of the elegance of white dinnerware and add flair for extra-special occasions, such as weddings and retirement parties. Many formal dinner pieces feature a white center and a border with an intricate design. Some of the borders are even lined with gold for added sparkle and glamour.We also offer seasonal dinnerware collections for Halloween with black cats and spooky witches on them. This dinnerware collection comes with a set of glass tumblers emblazoned with a white moon and silhouettes of bats. For an extra-special treat on Halloween, pick up a dinnerware collection of pumpkin serving pieces, including a large gourd with a ladle to serve punch out of, two smaller gourds for items like candy and a smaller pumpkin-leaf gravy boat. The white finish of these pumpkins looks great against a colorful tablecloth.

Unfortunately, increasingly busy lifestyles make this a bit difficult at times, so it s important to create a nutritional safety net for yourself by consuming diet and nutritional supplements that can boost your health. The wide variety of diet and nutritional supplements can make it difficult to know what s right for you, so learning the basics of choosing nutritional supplements is the first step to getting the best supplements for your needs   along with talking to your doctor about what you might need to take. With the wide selection of diet and nutritional supplements available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart, you can easily find all the vitamins and minerals that make it easier to lead a healthy lifestyle. Why should you use supplements? Nothing can replace a diet rich in minerals and vitamins, but when life gets busy and your stress levels rise, you may struggle to find the time to source and prepare nutritious dishes every day. By choosing nutrition supplements, you and your entire family can get the nutrition you need every day, no matter what life throws at you. Alternatively, if you're overweight and would like to lose weight, you may find it helpful to use dieting supplements such as appetite suppressants or fat inhibitors that can control your appetite and help you deal with the constant feeling of hunger. Vitamins and minerals Besides supporting general health, vitamins and mineral supplements may help head off chronic conditions, so it's important to make sure that your risk of dietary deficiencies is low by taking supplements. Before making your choice, ensure that you know what to look for in a multivitamin supplement.  Start by reading the label to identify the nutrients included as well as the amounts per serving.  If you're looking for a daily supplement that's suitable for most individuals, get a combination of basic vitamins and minerals. Some of the essential ingredients in such supplements include vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, A, folic acid, Vitamin E, iodine, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron. Multiple types of multivitamins are targeted at helping individuals with specific conditions or nutritional needs. Women, for example, could take a supplement with folic acid when they're pregnant to help avoid some congenital disabilities. Middle-aged women can take calcium and vitamin D supplements to lower the risk of osteoporosis. Check the percentages to determine whether a certain supplement offers you 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamins and minerals included. You shouldn t take multivitamins that exceed the 100 percent recommended dose. Proteins and meal replacements Protein powders, protein bars and meal replacement supplements are a popular choice for those who engage in sports regularly. The human body needs large amounts of protein as part of a balanced diet, but just like in the case of vitamins and minerals, it may be difficult to get all the amount you need from food. protein shakes are available in multiple types, with the most common of them being protein concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. Meal replacement shakes are often made with skim milk, and they're high in protein and fiber while being low in fat. They offer a high-energy meal, but they only have around 200 to 300 calories per serving. Protein bars are ideal for those moments you want a nutritious snack on the go. Diet supplements If losing weight is your goal, diet supplements can help you by curbing cravings and suppressing your appetite. Remember that these supplements aren't magic pills for losing weight and that they work well in combination with a nutritious, low-calorie diet and regular exercise. Chromium diet supplements are available in tablet form and they do a good job at reducing excess body fat while helping your body maintain normal sugar levels. Control your diet with an everyday weight loss kit that come complete with everything you need to embrace healthy eating, offering you a variety of breakfast options and snacks. Slimming powders combine appetite suppressants with protein and other nutrients to boost your metabolism. Diet-specific supplements are available at Walmart, so you can find options that are tailored to the specific phases of various diets.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167700707, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement. These popular supplements come in a wide variety of forms: pills, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, drinks (liquids and powders) and more. With so many options, it should be easy to find one that works for you. Vegetarians and vegans If you're a vegetarian, you may have deficiencies in protein, vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, zinc, iodine, riboflavin, calcium and selenium. Vegans are especially likely to be low in protein, selenium and B12. In addition to a multivitamin and mineral supplement, you might want to consider adding a vegan-friendly protein shake or two to your daily regimen. There are a wide variety of shake powders on the market, typically available in, but not limited to, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors. One scoop of protein powder usually provides approximately 25 grams of protein, but it varies from one supplier to another. Macrobiotic diet If you're on a macrobiotic diet, which is fixed on ideas about the types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D and other nutrients. The goal as a macrobiotic is to bring enlightenment, or healthy well-being, by teaching you how to thoughtfully choose what you eat. But it may come at a cost of some important vitamins. As with vegetarians and vegans, consider a solid multivitamin as a nutritional supplement. More support for seniors Seniors living in their own homes are often deficient in vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium and zinc and occasionally vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Older adults need more calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bone health. Try three daily servings of vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. Other calcium-rich foods include fortified cereals and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables and canned fish. These are all great additions to your daily meals, but be sure to take a multivitamin with age-adjusted doses of nutrients for people aged 50 years and older. Workout warriors For those who like to workout with weights, supplements can aid the recovery process and build muscle. Strength training on a regular basis breaks down your muscles so they can grow back bigger and stronger. Be sure to have a solid meal plan, get plenty of rest between workouts, lots of water and consider a protein supplement in the form of powders that can be mixed or protein bars. You can also add creatine to help build muscle and a variety of other workout supplements to assist with your fitness goals. At Walmart, you'll find a wide selection of vitamins and other supplements to help you keep up with your nutritional needs. Save money.
