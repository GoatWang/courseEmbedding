History[edit]




Oriental Hotel, Bangkok



The Mandarin, Hong Kong


The two hotels (with their original names) that formed the modern-day Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group in 1985


Although 1876 was the ‘official’ opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‘Oriental’ side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865.[2]
However, the history of the ‘Mandarin’ side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963, in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which continues to use a separate brand today, opened in Causeway Bay.
In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company, with the intention to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two "flagship" hotels for the company.[1]
In 1985, the Company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of "Mandarin Oriental International Limited." Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Victoria City, manages the activities of the Group’s hotels.[1]
Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates, or has under development, 41 hotels representing over 10,000 rooms in 27 countries, with 18 hotels in Asia, 12 in The Americas and 12 in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the Group operates, or has under development, 13 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, connected to the Group’s properties.[1]
Starting in September 2005, Mandarin Oriental showed the "Moments of Delight at Mandarin Oriental" at all hotels.[3] In 2007 this video was slightly updated to add new scenes and in 2014 it featured lyrics by Chinese singer, Sa Ding Ding.[4]
Current properties[edit]

History[edit]




Oriental Hotel, Bangkok



The Mandarin, Hong Kong


The two hotels (with their original names) that formed the modern-day Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group in 1985


Although 1876 was the ‘official’ opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‘Oriental’ side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865.[2]
However, the history of the ‘Mandarin’ side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963, in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which continues to use a separate brand today, opened in Causeway Bay.
In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company, with the intention to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two "flagship" hotels for the company.[1]
In 1985, the Company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of "Mandarin Oriental International Limited." Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Victoria City, manages the activities of the Group’s hotels.[1]
Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates, or has under development, 41 hotels representing over 10,000 rooms in 27 countries, with 18 hotels in Asia, 12 in The Americas and 12 in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the Group operates, or has under development, 13 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, connected to the Group’s properties.[1]
Starting in September 2005, Mandarin Oriental showed the "Moments of Delight at Mandarin Oriental" at all hotels.[3] In 2007 this video was slightly updated to add new scenes and in 2014 it featured lyrics by Chinese singer, Sa Ding Ding.[4]
Current properties[edit]

History[edit]




Oriental Hotel, Bangkok



The Mandarin, Hong Kong


The two hotels (with their original names) that formed the modern-day Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group in 1985


Although 1876 was the ‘official’ opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‘Oriental’ side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865.[2]
However, the history of the ‘Mandarin’ side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963, in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which continues to use a separate brand today, opened in Causeway Bay.
In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company, with the intention to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two "flagship" hotels for the company.[1]
In 1985, the Company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of "Mandarin Oriental International Limited." Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Victoria City, manages the activities of the Group’s hotels.[1]
Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates, or has under development, 41 hotels representing over 10,000 rooms in 27 countries, with 18 hotels in Asia, 12 in The Americas and 12 in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the Group operates, or has under development, 13 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, connected to the Group’s properties.[1]
Starting in September 2005, Mandarin Oriental showed the "Moments of Delight at Mandarin Oriental" at all hotels.[3] In 2007 this video was slightly updated to add new scenes and in 2014 it featured lyrics by Chinese singer, Sa Ding Ding.[4]
Current properties[edit]

History[edit]




Oriental Hotel, Bangkok



The Mandarin, Hong Kong


The two hotels (with their original names) that formed the modern-day Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group in 1985


Although 1876 was the ‘official’ opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‘Oriental’ side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865.[2]
However, the history of the ‘Mandarin’ side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963, in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which continues to use a separate brand today, opened in Causeway Bay.
In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company, with the intention to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two "flagship" hotels for the company.[1]
In 1985, the Company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of "Mandarin Oriental International Limited." Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Victoria City, manages the activities of the Group’s hotels.[1]
Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates, or has under development, 41 hotels representing over 10,000 rooms in 27 countries, with 18 hotels in Asia, 12 in The Americas and 12 in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the Group operates, or has under development, 13 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, connected to the Group’s properties.[1]
Starting in September 2005, Mandarin Oriental showed the "Moments of Delight at Mandarin Oriental" at all hotels.[3] In 2007 this video was slightly updated to add new scenes and in 2014 it featured lyrics by Chinese singer, Sa Ding Ding.[4]
Current properties[edit]

History[edit]




Oriental Hotel, Bangkok



The Mandarin, Hong Kong


The two hotels (with their original names) that formed the modern-day Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group in 1985


Although 1876 was the ‘official’ opening year of the Oriental Hotel, the origin of the ‘Oriental’ side of the Mandarin Oriental can be traced back as early as 1863, when two Americans, Captain Atkins Dyer and William West, opened the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand): however, the original building burnt down only two years later, on 11 June 1865.[2]
However, the history of the ‘Mandarin’ side of the group is comparatively recent: the Mandarin hotel opened only in 1963, in the Central District of Hong Kong Island. In 1973, The Excelsior Hotel, which continues to use a separate brand today, opened in Causeway Bay.
In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company, with the intention to expand into Asia. That year, the company acquired a 49% interest in the Oriental Hotel, resulting in two "flagship" hotels for the company.[1]
In 1985, the Company combined the two hotels under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. In 1987, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group was floated on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong under the name of "Mandarin Oriental International Limited." Mandarin Oriental International Limited, is incorporated in Bermuda, and listed in London, Singapore and Bermuda. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group Limited, which operates from Victoria City, manages the activities of the Group’s hotels.[1]
Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates, or has under development, 41 hotels representing over 10,000 rooms in 27 countries, with 18 hotels in Asia, 12 in The Americas and 12 in Europe and North Africa. In addition, the Group operates, or has under development, 13 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, connected to the Group’s properties.[1]
Starting in September 2005, Mandarin Oriental showed the "Moments of Delight at Mandarin Oriental" at all hotels.[3] In 2007 this video was slightly updated to add new scenes and in 2014 it featured lyrics by Chinese singer, Sa Ding Ding.[4]
Current properties[edit]
As of 2015[update], Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group operates hotels in China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, Spain, Turkey, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, United States and Morocco .[5]

Description:  Mandarin Oriental was known as an Asia-based hotel group with a strong balance sheet, significant ownership of its properties, which typically served high-end ...                        







Mandarin Oriental                             Hotel Group (A)12/2009-5554This case was written by Gabriel Szulanski, Professor of Strategy at INSEAD, Jessica Zee, Research Associate, andJenifer Raver, Research Associate. It is intended to be used as a basis for class discussion rather than to illustrateeither effective or ineffective handling of an administrative situation.Financial support from Capgemini Consulting is gratefully acknowledged.Copyright © 2009 INSEADTO ORDER COPIES OF INSEAD CASES, SEE DETAILS ON THE BACK COVER. COPIES MAY NOT BE MADE WITHOUT PERMISSION.IntroductionWhen Edouard Ettedgui took over as Chief Executive Officer of Mandarin Oriental HotelGroup in 1998, one of the questions he asked himself was, “How can I add value to thiscompany?” Looking at the business portfolio of the 12 Mandarin Oriental properties at thetime,1 he knew he had inherited a collection of first-class hotels that were consistently ratedamong the top three in their respective destinations including Hong Kong and Bangkok.Mandarin Oriental was known as an Asia-based hotel group with a strong balance sheet,significant ownership of its properties, which typically served high-end corporate executives,and an extraordinary brand reputation in Asia where 9 out of its 11 hotels were located.However, it was also clear that the Group had “a very limited brand profile outside of Asia” atthat point in time.2Ettedgui felt that more could be done with the Group by transforming it into an internationalbrand, and he had the ultimate aspiration of creating a brand that stood for ‘legendary’ hotels.Succeeding in key cities like New York, London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong would have ahuge impact on any luxury brand, but for Mandarin Oriental it would make future expansionwithin or beyond Asia, even more likely and impactful. He also believed that in the future,leisure (as opposed to business) guests would define the brand.With this vision in mind, he began working with his key executives to craft the plan forbringing the brand to the rest of the world. In 2000, Ettedgui and his team launched theGroup’s very first global advertising campaign for the brand. Previous advertising effortswere managed by and focused on individual hotel properties. The company hired M&CSaatchi to design the “She/he’s a fan” campaign, which was shot by the world famousphotographer and British royal, Lord Lichfield.3 The campaign elegantly connected theGroup’s well-recognised symbol – the fan – with international celebrities such as MichelleYeoh, I.M. Pei and Lance Armstrong, who regularly stayed at the hotels and were fans of theGroup.4The $5 million campaign focused on the USA and Western Europe, the two markets thataccounted “for the majority of high net worth individuals’ wealth,” according to the WorldWealth Report 1999 by CapGemini and Merrill Lynch.5 The campaign’s core theme, focusingon the brand as a whole rather than individual hotel properties, made an enormous impact forthe Group and was an immense success, with one of the highest recall rates. Magazines with aluxury leisure focus, such as Architectural Digest and Condé Nast Traveler US, beganregularly featuring the brand and its properties. As a result, it became well known to theluxury leisure travel community and among luxury hotel developers.1 Mandarin Oriental International Limited Annual Report 1998, Irasia,      <http://202.66.146.82/listco/sg/mandarin/annual/98/98annual.pdf> (14 November 2008).2 John Witt.

Henceforth, the mission was todecide how best to define, translate and project Mandarin Oriental’s legendary hospitalityexperience in New York, a destination which was not only far removed in terms of distancebut also culture.The IndustryAccording to the World Travel & Tourism Council, travel and tourism accounted for $3,575billion (10.8% of global GDP) and 200 million jobs worldwide in 1999. The industry wasimpacted by the Asian economic crisis in 1997, particularly in Asia, where declining visitorarrivals resulted in fierce price competition. Quantified as an economic engine for developedand developing economies worldwide, travel and tourism was estimated to grow from 3.5% in2000 to 4.2% in 2010. In the long run, its economic contribution was expected to grow to$6,591 billion (11.6% of global GDP) in 2010, supporting 250 million jobs.6The global hotel industry generated total revenues of over $99.7 billion in 1999 and waspredicted to grow at 8.1% to $107 billion in 2000.7 Projected industry revenue was estimatedto exceed $567.5 billion by 2012.8 Geographically diverse, the hotel industry servicedconsumers around the globe with 16.3 million hotel rooms worldwide as of 2000,9 and manythousands more under development. The luxury hotel segment was unique in the global hotel industry. It could be definedprimarily by premium room rates, a clientele with high average net worth, and comprehensiveluxury amenities and facilities such as spa services, celebrity chef-run restaurants, luxuriousdesign aesthetics and, most importantly, an emphasis on offering superior service for apositive customer “experience”.The key players in the luxury hotel sector as defined by brand position, number of rooms andbusiness models, included Accor Hospitality (Sofitel), Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental,Starwood Hotels & Resorts (St. Regis), The Peninsula Hotels and Marriott Hotels (Ritz-Carlton). Among them, Starwood, Accor and Marriott had brand portfolios covering multiplecustomer segments from economy to luxury, while Four Seasons, Peninsula and MandarinOriental had established individual collections of luxury hotels under their respective flagshipbrands. Most of the key incumbents adopted an asset-light strategy, with the exception ofPeninsula and Mandarin Oriental, which both owned the majority of their properties.

These two “legendary” hotels,10 widely recognised by respected travel associations andpublications, gave rise to Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, an international hotel investmentand management company whose strategic objective was to be recognised as the world’s bestluxury hotel group.11 In Ettedgui’s words, the Group was in the business of running“legendary hotels, not five-star hotels.”12 In his view, “A legendary hotel does not need arating system because its standing is obvious.”13By 1999, the Group employed some 6,000 people and operated 12 luxury hotels worldwidegenerating revenues of $342 million, an increase of 1% over 1998.14 Out of the 12 hotels,Mandarin Oriental San Francisco and Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London, were the onlytwo operating outside Asia. Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park was known for its history because“Members of the Royal Family have always been frequent visitors and even the Queenlearned to dance within the glorious ballroom.” It also boasted the only private royal entranceto the park.15As a result of the economic downturn, 1998 and 1999 were challenging years, with thedecline in travel and tourism in Asia impacting most of the hotels in the Group. JardineMatheson, a Hong Kong-based trading conglomerate, at that time owned about 53% of thecompany through Jardine Strategic Holdings. (For the Group’s recent financial performance,see Exhibit 1).The Group’s executive committee was made up of regional managers and operational heads.A majority of the executive management team members were sourced from around the world,while customer service functions in each hotel were carried out by local employees to ensurean authentic feel. The management team (see Exhibit 2) focused primarily on operationalissues. The business was operationally intensive in the sense that the hotels’ success dependedon continuous and close attention to detail – the nuts-and-bolts of service excellence – whichultimately distinguished Mandarin Oriental Hotels’ operations and service delivery from thecompetition.10 Source 1: “Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong Review”, Fodor’s website,      <http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/hong-kong/review-32068.html>, (14 September 2008).

In addition to a top-down strategy-making process, thebottom-up communication within the organisation created a constant information flow wheregeneral managers and operational heads filtered out and forwarded staff suggestions to themanagement team. Decisions were communicated via meetings and internal publications,with several intermediate rounds of back-and-forth discussions before final decisions weremade.The Senior DirectorsEdouard EttedguiSince 1998, Ettedgui had been CEO of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, having formerlyserved as Finance Director in another subsidiary of the parent company, Jardine MathesonGroup. A French national and graduate of ESSEC in Paris, Ettedgui had extensive finance andbusiness development experience with major international corporations. He was a member ofthe World Travel & Tourism Council and had been appointed Advisor on External Trade inHong Kong by the French government. Ettedgui was a passionate believer in the totalalignment of all decisions towards growing Mandarin Oriental into an international luxurybrand, including its geographical locations, architecture and decor, marketing campaigns,human resources and customer service guidelines.John WittAfter he came on board, Ettedgui promoted Witt, a qualified chartered accountant fromCanada with an INSEAD MBA degree, to be the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. Witt hadextensive international experience in financial planning and control as well as in businessdevelopment in consumer industries. Ettedgui described him as “a very important businesspartner capable of critical evaluation and lateral thinking, he is someone who can go acrossdepartments and bring it back to what it means to the bottom line.”16 Witt received his firstdegree, a Bachelor of Commerce, from Trinity College, University of Toronto.Terry StinsonAn American lawyer and mechanical engineer by training, Stinson joined Mandarin Orientalin 1997 as Group Development Director, overseeing the continued development andexecution of new projects around the world. He was the Group’s most senior representativefrom the US. With his vast experience in hotel development and initially as General Counsel,Stinson had been central to the Group’s growth. In Ettedgui’s words, he was a “very seniorguy” whom others viewed as having substance: “You see him, you see gravitas.”17Led by Ettedgui, this trio demonstrated a commitment to establishing Mandarin Oriental as achain of legendary hotels offering a holistic experience of 21st century luxury with orientalcharm, by defining the corporate brand strategy. The three men had always been keenlyobservant of industry developments and were kept well informed by staff members within the16 Edouard Ettedgui. Interview by MOS Project Group, INSEAD, 7 April 2008.17 Ibid.Copyright © 2009 INSEAD  4                                                  12/2009-5554Group via small group meetings and collegial communications. As the brand’s chiefambassador, Ettedgui came up with “intuitions” concerning brand strategies based onpersonal analysis. Witt played the dual role of independently assessing the quality ofEttedgui’s intuitions, helping him to articulate them as well as to give them economicmeaning. He also helped Ettedgui identify tradeoffs in the larger scheme of development. Asa well-respected industry veteran, Stinson offered invaluable perspectives within the trio,thinking through and sketching out potential developments for Mandarin Oriental hotels.Perspectives on the CompetitionEttedgui viewed the luxury hotel segment as fundamentally a growth industry, but cyclicaland fragmented. The Group looked at competitors from two broad dimensions. First, from astrategic development standpoint, Four Seasons remained the strongest competitor given itssolid brand reputation for customer services, its creation of modern luxury, and its sustainedtrack record, especially in the North America market. Ritz-Carlton, recently acquired byMarriott, was another major competitor in the luxury hotel segment. Operating third-party-owned hotels under management contracts, Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton had achieved areputation for excellent service with extensive global geographical coverage. In addition,individual properties, such as The Carlyle in New York, Claridges in London, and the Crillonin Paris were also seen as major competitors owing to their historical success as stand-alonehotels. They were often targets for acquisition by development conglomerates or sponsorshipby private equity with the objective of leveraging their brand recognition to expand andgenerate returns to the parent company or investors. Another group of competitors were thosewith an Asian service concept and/or similar focus on internationalisation, such as Shangri-La, Raffles and Banyan Tree.Secondly, within each destination the Group defined five primary competitor hotels, basedstrictly on standards of luxury and geographical proximity, regardless of the brand.The BrandMandarin Oriental Hotel Group’s brand was strongly identified with subdued elegance,traditional oriental values and the concept of “delighting our guests”. (For the Group’sdefinition of “delight” see Exhibit 3).“Mandarin Oriental stood for 21st century luxury with oriental charm,” said Ettedgui.18 Tohim, 21st century luxury was the right mix of tradition, quality and innovation. Looking at thecompetition, consisting of mostly management contract-driven incumbents, Ettedgui believedthat the Group’s ownership or significant interest in hotel properties enabled proprietarycontrol of all aspects of the hotel and its services, thereby allowing it to take risks to innovate,customise and differentiate, particularly as “all innovations in the industry came from owner-operated hotels.”19 At Mandarin Oriental, 21st century luxury was achieved via the use oftechnology, food and beverage offerings, and the Mandarin Oriental Spa. While integratingthe unique sense of place and culture of each destination, the Group’s hotels reflected orientalcharm in the hospitality experience through subtle Asian touches in its dining offerings, spaservices, decor and staff.18 Edouard Ettedgui. Interview by MOS Project Group, INSEAD, 7 April 2008.19 Ibid.Copyright © 2009 INSEAD  5                                                  12/2009-5554Mandarin Oriental’s strength ultimately derived from the customer’s belief in what the brandstood for,20 i.e., the guests defined the brand. While the perception of a ‘legendary’ hotel wasrather intangible and subjective, guests often recalled specific memories or experiences at oneor more hotels when expressing appreciation for the brand. These vignettes were often passedon from guest to guest. A typical example came from a customer of the terrace restaurant ofthe Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London, where “a terrace butler was on hand on hotsummer days with a selection of sunscreens, cooling iced towers, water sprays and sunglassescleaning service…”21 Furthermore, Ettedgui and his team believed that generations of localpatrons were central to Mandarin Oriental’s two legendary hotels in Hong Kong andBangkok. The hotel lobby and its adjacent Captain’s Bar at Mandarin Oriental Hong Kongwere popular meeting venues for local senior executives and decision makers,22 while theClipper Lounge, on its mezzanine floor, was one of Hong Kong's most popular places for hightea among local socialites and ladies of society.23While each and every Mandarin Oriental hotel delivered exceptional services, Ettedguibelieved that building and enhancing the brand was the only way to fully capture andarticulate the value of the collective strengths of all Mandarin Oriental hotels. With theultimate aspiration of creating a brand that stood for ‘legendary’ hotels, the management teamaligned corporate strategy at every customer touchpoint to strengthen global brand recognitionvia building critical mass, developing a more balanced geographical coverage, and leveragingcore competencies and heritage.Under the leadership of Ettedgui, the Group underwent international expansion from its 12hotels in 1999, with a plan to establish more than 10,000 rooms in a portfolio of more than 40hotels around the world over the next few years. (For the Group’s development timeline, seeExhibit 4). According to Witt, as the management team grew the brand on the basis of the‘legendary’ image, the team would manage it “as a luxury brand rather than a hotel brand.”24Highly brand focused, it evaluated new hotel projects based on whether they “have thepotential to be a legendary hotel in the community or its resort over time, and have the abilityto add value to the existing hotels.”25At Mandarin Oriental, the food and beverage offerings, the spas and the consistent delivery ofexceptional service enabled the brand to communicate to two target audiences: the localcommunity and travellers. Over time, the brand as a whole had become far greater than thesum of these individual elements.Food & Beverage OfferingsContrary to the generic industry model whereby hotel restaurants were mainly a cost centrefor the purpose of servicing guests, Mandarin Oriental had both the capability and the20 Ettedgui, Edouard. “The way forward” (Mandarin Oriental Group internal publication), 2007.21 “City restaurant pops up in temporary English garden”, July 24 2008, Springwise Newsletter website,      <http://springwise.com/weekly/2008-07-24.htm>, (17 September 2008).22 “Meeting Lobbies,” Kiwi Collection website,      <http://www.kiwicollection.com/sensations_section/ITEM=72/>, 05 December 2008.23 Oriental Travel website, <http://www.orientaltravel.com/hotel/city/det_mandarin_oriental.htm>, 05      December 2008.24 John Witt. Interview by Jessica Zee and Gabriel Szulanski, INSEAD, 27 June 2008.25 Ibid.Copyright © 2009 INSEAD  6  12/2009-5554tradition of running good restaurants in its hotels, many of which had, over time, becomepopular in the local community for regular dining, such as business lunches betweenexecutives, social meals among friends and family, as well as celebratory events like weddingbanquets. It was not uncommon to find at least two restaurants in each of its hotels thatcatered to the varying needs of international travellers as well as to a local clientele.Consistent Delivery of Exceptional ServiceThe management team saw exceptional service as the “crux of everything”,26 the essentialingredient for any hotel to become legendary. The Group had come a long way from verballyhanding down service traditions, to sharing written standards among individual hoteloperations, and now to measuring performance via a proprietary standard – LegendaryQuality Experiences (LQE). Over time, the Group incorporated guest feedback,commissioned detailed consumer research and hired professionals to define elegant yetauthentic service with the help of cutting-edge technology and rigorously trained staff toensure consistent delivery of exceptional service.The Spa at Mandarin OrientalA definitive brand identifier championed by Ettedgui in 1999 – the development of The Spa atMandarin Oriental – was aligned with the company’s goal of providing “21st century luxurywith oriental charm”,27 its brand heritage and name, as spas were already very much part ofthe culture in Thailand, India, Japan and China. At that time, spas typically existed in resortdestinations, not the urban locations where Mandarin Oriental (and its competitors) operated.During a three-week trip to Northern India with their wives, Ettedgui and his team wereintroduced to and experienced Ayurvedic spa and yoga. They assessed the validity andfeasibility of implementing the spa experience in every Mandarin Oriental hotel, andconsidered whether or not to ultimately incorporate the spa experience into the brand.While spas were costly to build and had a generally lower return rate per unit area than that ofhotel rooms, Ettedgui saw their potential to attract customers who would pay a premium for aquality spa service and, more importantly, choose to stay at the hotel specifically for the spaexperience. Equally, if defined and implemented well, spas could be a unique, tangible andcredible element of Mandarin Oriental’s holistic ambience and experience that would furtherdistinguish the brand from its competitors, enabling it to attract a leisure audience and furtherheighten its prestige.Leveraging this thinking, Mandarin Oriental Bangkok’s existing spa operation (the world’sfirst well-known hotel spa), and experts recruited from the spa industry, The Spa at MandarinOriental was built to provide an exclusive, highly personalised and holistic approach towellness in a generous space, offering therapies including Chinese, Ayurvedic and Europeanalternative treatments from yoga to pilates, impressive heat and water therapies, privaterelaxation, spa cuisine and bespoke spa products. It was well known that “One does not cometo the Mandarin Oriental Spa for a quick one-hour appointment.”28 The spa offered “Time26 Edouard Ettedgui. Interview by MOS Project Group, INSEAD, 7 April 2008.27 Ibid.28 “Like mother, like daughter”, Condé Nast Traveller, February 2005.Copyright © 2009 INSEAD  7                                                  12/2009-5554rituals” and “journey experiences akin to a rite of passage.”29 Over the years, The Spa atMandarin Oriental had become a prominent yet integral part of the holistic hospitalityexperience. They were regularly featured in various media, particularly those with a luxuryleisure audience, further enhancing the Group’s appeal to travellers around the world and tothe local community.Next Stop …New YorkEver since its inception, the Group had strongly focused on a real estate-driven strategy,owning a significant equity share in its hotels. While Ettedgui believed that control over theproperties allowed management to take risks and innovate (which was key to the success ofany luxury brand), he made it his mandate to fully leverage the power of the brand and todevelop Mandarin Oriental at the international level. Executing this mandate was particularlychallenging at the beginning as the Group had a limited brand profile outside Asia, the orderof expansion into new geographical boundaries was unclear, and it was unfamiliar withspecific locations. To Ettedgui, North America was a major market in which the company hadto strengthen its overall corporate presence30 in order to become an international brand thatwas strong both within and outside Asia. It was therefore logical that this market became thefocus of Mandarin Oriental’s first global branding campaign. As a destination, New York wasabsolutely essential: not only was it among the world’s top three cities but it was also thecentre of the luxury media industry. At the time, Ettedgui noted:       “New York is also an important feeder market for Mandarin Oriental Hotel       Group’s properties; Manhattan is achieving exceptionally high occupancies and       rates within the luxury hotel sector, with limited additional room supply       anticipated in the near future.”31The management team asked themselves several key questions. How would the flagship hotelin New York be developed? What were the absolute essentials of the brand? What woulddefine Mandarin Oriental, New York? Regarding the first question, the management team hadtwo potential options: to acquire and transform an existing hotel, or to work with a developerto build a brand new hotel. In reality, the availability of prime location sites or propertieswould very much drive the decision. The latter questions were more abstract and a delicatebalance would need to be achieved between the two. To the management team all threequestions were intertwined.Conceiving Mandarin Oriental, New YorkMandarin Oriental Group aimed to preserve the core brand values of its holistic hospitalityexperience in New York. However, it was unclear how it would be received in New York, adestination that was far removed from Asia both in terms of culture and distance. Anotherunknown was how Mandarin Oriental could succeed as a brand with a “very limited brand29 Ibid.30 Ettedgui, Edouard. “The way forward” (Mandarin Oriental Group internal publication), 2007.31 “Mandarin Oriental Announces Luxury Hotel in New York”, 23 September 1999, the Mandarin Oriental      website, <www.mandarinoriental.com>, 23 September 1999.Copyright © 2009 INSEAD  8  12/2009-5554profile outside of Asia”.32 Would Mandarin Oriental New York be able to become a legendaryhotel, appealing to local patrons in New York, like its counterparts in Bangkok and HongKong? This was another uncertainty.While the importance of consistent delivery of exceptional service was indisputable,replicating Mandarin Oriental’s very own exceptional service model was consideredimpossible by many from outside of the Group, based on their belief that cheap labour costs inAsia was the pre-condition for this model – labour costs were known to be high in New York.In addition, a quick scan of factors such as dining and leisure habits in New York at that timerevealed potential differences in the perception of hotel restaurants and spas, as outlinedbelow.In Asia, restaurants had been much better integrated into hotels, generating revenues fromlocal patrons as well as travelers, whereas in New York restaurants in luxury hotels wereoffered as a service to guests rather than a serious part of hotel operations. At worst, they wereseen as a “necessary evil” and tended to be viewed as cost centres. The best restaurants werenot to be found in hotels because hoteliers focused mainly on international travellers whotypically went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast.Furthermore, introducing the spa concept would be controversial. At the time, full urban spaswere a new concept to New York and involved expensive investment in terms of propertyspace and operating costs. Stinson, as Development Director, shared the views of mostproperty developers: his priority was to extract maximum value from every investment. Whileacknowledging the Mandarin Oriental Spa as an important brand identifier, he was concernedabout the high costs involved and the uncertain return from the spa business in this very newmarket.However, Ettedgui was passionate about introducing the full brand experience to New York.He was also confident that travellers would be willing to pay a premium for a quality spaexperience, and that the spa would attract leisure business from both locals and travellers whowould otherwise not come to the hotel at all. In his view, in the scheme of building legendaryhotels, the hotel’s reputation would ultimately depend upon leisure customers rather thancorporate travellers. The full spa offering in an urban setting would be particularly importantin attracting the right customers to this key destination. It would also help position the hotelin the local community as the fullness of the experience would also attract local patrons.As Ettedgui walked to the conference room to meet the rest of the team in preparation for theupcoming discussion with potential developers in New York, he wondered how MandarinOriental New York would ultimately be defined.32 John Witt.
