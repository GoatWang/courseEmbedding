IL-4 modulate the tumor microenvironment and response to cancer therapies  Cancer Res July 15 2016 
Read more





















 Welcome to Medicenna 
Medicenna is a clinical stage, immuno-oncology company developing novel first-in-class, Interleukin-4 Empowered Cytokines™ (IL4-ECs) that specifically target the Interleukin-4 Receptor (IL4R).  Unlike normal cells, the IL4R is over-expressed in 20 different cancers corresponding to an annual incidence of over 1 million IL4R positive cancers.
   Read more 
Our Mission
Our mission is to be the leader in the development and commercialization of targeted Empowered Cytokines™ and Superkines™ for the treatment of cancer. We aim to achieve our goals by drawing on our expertise with that of world-class collaborators to develop a unique set of Superkines™ that can be fused with pro-apoptotic proteins in order to precisely deliver potent cell-killing agents to cancer cells, the immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment and cancer stem cells without harming healthy cells.
Our Name
The name, Medicenna, is derived by fusing the word “Medicine” with the name, Avicenna, who has, for a thousand years, retained his original renown as one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history. He is regarded, as the father of Evidence Based Medicine.

Home»Our Science»Why Target The IL4R









WHY TARGET THE IL4R

Expression levels of IL4R are low on the surface of healthy and normal cells, but increase several fold on cancer cells and non-malignant cells of the TME
Analysis of over 2,000 cancer biopsies, shows that the IL-4R is over-expressed in 20 different types solid and hematological cancers corresponding to an annual incidence rate of over a million IL4R positive cancers
The IL-4/IL-4R axis plays a prominent role in supporting the establishment and maintenance of a robust TME, thereby protecting the cancer from the body’s own immune system and immunotherapies
The IL-4/IL-4R bias continues to be identified as a marker for highly aggressive forms of cancer and is generally associated with poor survival outcomes
Cancer stem cells also thrive in the presence of IL-4

	Medicenna Therapeutics, Corp. - Our Science - The Challenge





































Skip to main content








































Home»Our Science»The Challenge









THE CHALLENGE
Cancer continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, there were 14M new cases of cancer worldwide in 2012. In 2030 there will be nearly 22M.  Although advanced targeted therapies have improved survival outcomes for some cancers, the cure rates for the majority of cancers still remain low. 
There are many reasons for the challenges that lie ahead. For instance, in a wide range of tumor types, there exists a typically small subpopulation of cells within the cancer that have been termed tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have been shown to be more chemotherapy and radiation resistant than non-CSCs. 
Furthermore, although cancer cells and CSCs are the driving force of tumor development and progression, these transformed cells cannot do it alone. It is the complex interaction between the cancer and surrounding non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME), that helps drive the process of cancer progression. So progression from normal to benign, benign to malignant, malignant to metastatic is driven not just by what's happening inside the cancer cell itself but also by what's happening around it. 
The big advantage cancer cells have is their ability to mutate and develop resistance following conventional therapies. Fortunately, non-malignant host cells of the TME do not mutate or develop resistance. Therefore, within the context of ecology and Darwinian evolution, the most efficient way to kill a species (cancer cells and CSCs) is to alter its ecosystem (TME).

	Medicenna Therapeutics, Corp. - Our Science - Our Approach





































Skip to main content








































Home»Our Science»Our Approach









OUR APPROACH
At Medicenna, our  approach is to develop and commercialize a novel class of multi-targeted fusion  proteins, we call Interleukin-4 Empowered Cytokines (IL4-ECs). These  proprietary, first-in-class targeted Molecular Trojan Horses are designed to  harness the exceptional specificity and affinity of Superkines™ (engineered  cytokines) to selectively and simultaneously deliver cell killing Payloads to  the bulk tumor, tumor microenvironment (TME) and cancer stem cells (CSC). 

The interleukin-4  receptor (IL4R) is an attractive target for the development of cancer  therapeutics, because it is frequently and intensely expressed on a wide  variety of human carcinomas. The recent determination of a pivotal role for  IL4R in the emergence and advancement of the malignant phenotype,  overexpression on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and its dominant role in the tumor  micro-environment (TME) validates our approach of pursuing with the IL4R as an  important cancer target.
Components of the  TME, such as Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs), Myeloid Derived Suppressor  Cells (MDSCs) and a Th2>>Th1 profile, are each attributed to a robust  IL-4/IL-4R bias and generally associated with highly aggressive forms of cancer  and poor survival outcomes. We believe that  major improvement in cancer outcomes can be achieved if a multi-pronged  approach was deployed. Medicenna’s IL4-ECs are capable of ablating the bulk  tumor, depleting cancer stem cells (CSCs) weakening the angiogenic pro-tumoral  microenvironment (TAMs) and stripping the immunosuppressive cloak protecting  the tumor (MDSCs). By doing so, IL4-ECs have the potential to radically improve  patient outcomes.

Our Target Centric approach  is complemented by our Patient Centric approach in that, by selecting patient  populations that have a biased IL-4/IL-4R profile, we believe that our IL4-ECs  will have a higher probability of clinical, regulatory and re-imbursement  success.

Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. Key Developments

Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. and Medicenna Biopharma Inc. Appoint Jay Stoudemire as Chief Scientific Officer
Jul 17 17
Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary Medicenna Biopharma Inc. announced that it has appointed industry veteran Dr. Jay Stoudemire as Chief Scientific Officer. He joins Medicenna from Mirna Therapeutics, where he was Vice President of Preclinical Development, Regulatory, and Quality Assurance and led the team driving oncology drug development efforts for multiple microRNA-based therapeutics spanning discovery- to clinical-stage programs.


Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. Reports Earnings Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended March 31, 2017
Jun 16 17
Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. reported earnings results for the fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, net loss was $4,355,743 compared to a net loss of $197,732 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily the result of clinical trial costs associated with enrollment and development initiatives as well as site costs related to the initiation of the Phase 2b clinical trial of MDNA55.

For the year, net loss was $7,631,265, compared to a net loss of $1,334,064 for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net loss in the year ended March 31, 2017 compared with the year ended March 31, 2016 was primarily a result of a one-time non-cash listing expense of $1,784,414 related to the Transaction, costs associated with initiating the Phase 2b clinical trial of MDNA55 (including headcount necessary to support the ongoing trial), intellectual property costs (including a one-time license payment of $636,000 related to the Transaction), professional fees related to the Transaction and increased general corporate expenditures necessary to establish and operate a public company.


Brainlab and Medicenna Therapeutics Corp Announces Phase 2B Clinical Trial of MDNA55
Jun 8 17
Brainlab and Medicenna Therapeutics Corp. jointly announced that recurrent Glioblastoma (rGB) patients in a Phase 2b clinical trial of MDNA55, a targeted immunotherapy agent, have been treated at three clinical centers in the United States using innovative drug delivery technology from Brainlab. The investigators used convection enhanced delivery (CED) to inject MDNA55, together with an imaging agent, directly into the tumor. When combined with real-time image guided MRI, CED allows delivery of MDNA55 at high concentrations into the tumor tissue while avoiding exposure to the rest of the body. The current Phase 2b clinical trial plans to enroll 43 adult patients with rGB at leading brain cancer centers in the United States. Precise targeting is an integral part in the treatment of brain tumors to achieve significant coverage. iPlan Flow planning software from Brainlab helps determine trajectories for drug infusions while VarioGuide, a universal instrument holder, is then used to guide the drug delivery device into place for treatment. Designed specifically for planning drug delivery procedures, iPlan Flow software determines trajectories and infusion parameters based on patient-specific image data. The combination of this technology with clinical trial  support services allows Brainlab to offer a comprehensive drug delivery solution to pharmaceutical companies.
