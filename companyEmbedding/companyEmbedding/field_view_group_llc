                                    Climate FieldView™ Cab captures and stores all your data and accurate, high-resolution maps.
                                

                                    What do those maps tell you? Everything you want to know about every pass, every row, every foot. They tell you what you can do to improve your performance.
                                     
                                    Was the spacing as good as it can get? Did singulation swing on your triple stack? How did your hybrids compare? How did that clay knob affect down force?
                                     
                                    Add your own field notes, photos, anything. You’ll have the ideal scouting tool. You’ll learn more, you’ll understand more. You’ll build on that. You’ll realize your best possible yields.

Your Field in High Definition

                        Climate FieldView™ Cab is the HD mapping, take-anywhere,
                        accessible and actionable tool for your fields.
                    


RealTime,
                        HD Maps

                        Climate FieldView™ Cab shows you exactly what you’re planting, how you’re planting, as you’re planting it, in high definition.
                         
                        Pick out patterns that would be impossible to identify with data alone.
                         
                        Suddenly, detailed data is now accessible and actionable with maps and simple reports.
                    


Compare & Contrast, Visually

                        See patterns in your field that you couldn’t see with raw data alone.
                         
                        Speed & Down Force. Hybrid A & Hybrid B. Population & Yield. Is there a correlation? Take a
                        look — you’ll be amazed at the insights you gain.
                    


See What Matters

                        Climate FieldView™ Cab’s reports bring relevancy to all the summaries you see.
                         
                        Prioritize items you want to look through, in simple reports that bring clarity to planter data.
                        Diagnose planter issues while in the field — and fix them.
                    


Your Maps are Mobile

                        Your maps go with you into the field on foot — they’re not locked in your cab monitor.
                         
                        Scouting in your field is easy when you can take your iPad with you. Photograph issues to show others in your operation.
                         
                        Mark locations in the field with pins that will sync to all your operations’ devices.
                         
                        These in-field events will be evident when harvest comes, and Climate FieldView™ Plus will remember.

            Innovating at the intersection of 
        

            agriculture and technology
        


        In a few short decades, the world’s population is on pace to grow 50 percent.¹ For farmers, that rapid growth translates to an urgent need to find more efficient, sustainable ways to grow substantially more food. Now more than ever, farmers need access to tools that support the decisions they make every day to maximize their return on every acre. At The Climate Corporation, we are dedicated to creating technologies that transform field data into meaningful insights that help farmers sustainably enhance yield potential, improve efficiency, and manage their risk.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
