According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, hemolysis as indicated by an elevated ETCO (End-Tidal Carbon Monoxide) value is a major risk factor for developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Learn why it’s so critical for physicians and nurses to determine which newborns are at greater risk due to an underlying hemolytic condition, and why the CoSense Monitor is the only monitor available for the accurate measurement of ETCO, which may be used for the detection of hemolysis in newborns.

Cluster Headaches - Capnia















































Therapeutics



			Cluster Headaches          








Cluster headaches are characterized by recurring bouts of excruciating pain in one side of the head. Episodes of pain typically last from 15 minutes to three hours. The headaches can occur several times a day over several months of time before remission. However, the same pattern often recurs multiple times over a patient’s lifetime. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients have chronic cluster headaches with continuing pain with no remission. The pain of cluster headaches may be significantly greater than other conditions, such as severe migraine.
In order to combat this debilitating condition, an investigator-sponsored clinical trial is being conducted by to evaluate its proprietary nasal, non-inhaled carbon dioxide (nasal CO2) technology for the treatment of cluster headaches. The trial is designed to explore Capnia’s nasal CO2 technology in a clinical setting, and the company looks forward to the product’s future in potentially treating this rare and severely painful neurological condition.
For more information on this clinical trial please visit ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02381795).

CoSense® ETCO Monitor          



Overview
Technology
Clinical References
Other Applications
Product Resources







Jaundice is a highly prevalent condition.
9 million babies are born in the US and Europe each year.1 60-80% of these babies will develop jaundice.2,3

In many babies, this is a normal condition that can be easily treated.
Babies with both HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA and HEMOLYSIS are at greatest risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.4
HOWEVER, in some newborns, jaundice is not normal and is caused by an underlying HEMOLYTIC CONDITION.
Untreated jaundice has a range of clinical and financial impacts for patients and hospitals.
According to the AAP Guidelines, newborns with a hemolytic condition need to receive phototherapy at lower levels of bilirubin than other newborns.5








Since 2004, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended the use of ETCO testing.
AAP Guidelines recommend the use of ETCO testing in newborns 35 weeks’ gestation or more who:5

are receiving phototherapy, or
have TSB rising rapidly, or
have TSB approaching transfusion levels, or
have jaundice unexplained by history and physical.






Published data show that ETCO testing, unlike blood tests, provides an accurate measure of hemolysis.6 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended the use of ETCO to directly measure bilirubin production rates in newborns.5 Multiple clinical trials have validated the ability of the CoSense ETCO Monitor to measure ETCO, which may be used to detect the rate of hemolysis in newborns.7,8

Capnia Acquires Neonatal Pulmonary Resuscitation Solutions From NeoForce Group, Inc.

Acquisition Strengthens Capnia's Presence in Neonatology

NeoForce President and Chief Executive Officer to Join Capnia as General Manager of Neonatology

	REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Sept. 8, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capnia, Inc. (NASDAQ:CAPN), focused on the development and commercialization of novel products based on its proprietary technologies for precision metering of gas flow, today announced that it has acquired substantially all assets from privately-held NeoForce Group, Inc., a developer of innovative pulmonary resuscitation solutions for the inpatient and ambulatory neonatal markets.

	Under the terms of the agreement, Capnia will pay to NeoForce a $1.0 million upfront payment, which represents less than one times of NeoForce's 12-month forward looking revenue, plus a low single-digit royalty on sales of NeoForce products for a period of 36 months. NeoForce's currently marketed products include the NeoPIP™ Infant T-Piece Resuscitator and the CPRNome Resuscitation Timer. Additionally, NeoForce President and Chief Executive Officer, Otho Boone, will join the Company as General Manager of Neonatology. Mr. Boone, who founded NeoForce in 2005, brings to Capnia over 25 years of medical device sales, operations and product development experience at neonatology focused companies such as Drager, Hill-Rom Air Shields and Ohmeda. Prior to founding NeoForce, Mr. Boone was Vice President of Global Marketing at Drager.

	"The acquisition of NeoForce further underscores our commitment to leveraging technology to address unmet medical needs in Neonatology, which is one of the most attractive segments in the healthcare business today," said Anish Bhatnagar, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Capnia. "As General Manager of Neonatology, Otho brings a depth of expertise and broad relationships with top tier hospitals across the United States which we can leverage to accelerate the adoption of our CoSense® ETCO monitor. Neonatology is a high-growth area, and we believe that the addition of Otho and the NeoForce product line, together with the ongoing commercial rollout of CoSense®, significantly strengthen our presence in this area."

	"I am excited to be joining the Capnia team and advancing the Company's commercial efforts," said Otho Boone, President and CEO of NeoForce. "NeoForce is a revenue generating, profitable entity that will benefit greatly from additional commercial manpower to further scale its operations. We also have a number of new products that we would like to bring to the market. Capnia's expertise is highly complementary, and I look forward to calling on new and existing hospital customers to maximize the potential of our combined platform of products, as well as bring more innovation to the market."

	For additional information on NeoForce, please visit www.neoforcegroup.com.

About Capnia

	Capnia, Inc. develops and commercializes novel products based on its proprietary technologies for precision metering of gas flow. Capnia's lead product CoSense® is based on the Sensalyze™ Technology Platform. It is a portable, non-invasive device that rapidly and accurately measures carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaled breath. CoSense has 510(k) clearance for sale in the U.S. and has received CE Mark certification for sale in the European Union. CoSense is used for the monitoring of CO from internal sources (such as hemolysis, a dangerous condition in which red blood cells degrade rapidly), as well as external sources (such as CO poisoning and smoke inhalation). The initial target market is newborns with jaundice that are at risk for hemolysis, comprising approximately three million births in the U.S. and European Union. Capnia's proprietary therapeutic technology uses nasal, non-inhaled CO2 and is being evaluated to treat the symptoms of allergies, as well as the trigeminally-mediated pain conditions such as cluster headache, trigeminal neuralgia and migraine.
