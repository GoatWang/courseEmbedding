                            Who We Are
                        












We've been around a long time.






Longevity
In 1894 Edward Maritz started the E. Maritz Jewelry company, a wholesaler and manufacturer of fine jewelry and engraved watches.





Innovation
Reinvention is in our DNA. We pioneered the incentives industry, revolutionized meeting planning, and are transforming customer experiences. In short, we never stop exploring what's next.





People-Focused
It's always been about people for us. Whether you're our client, employee, or a program participant, we value you as a person. It's our strength. And when you work with us, it's yours. 











We're always looking ahead, but we have a very rich history.
– Steve Maritz

















Backed by Science

At our core, we’re a behavior company. The scientific study of human behavior is a central component of Maritz’ DNA, and ingrained in the design of our solutions.
Under the leadership of Chief Behavioral Officer Charlotte Blank, we’re uncovering the latest aha moments in behavioral science and sharing their potential with the modern business world. By connecting our network of leading-edge behavioral science experts and Maritz’ Fortune 500 clients, we’re a catalyst for solving today’s business challenges.
 










Every person can make
                        a difference.
                    
—Brian Bergman, Senior Analyst and Teach for America Maritz Motivation Coach




















Giving Back
in more ways than one.









Education
People drive communities, too. That's why Maritz gives both our dollars and time to educational programs that help children and adults reach their full potential.









Community
We give to non-profit partners who share our values of innovation and results. Together, we make a real impact on our communities. Read our giving guidelines >
Read our community impact report >











Diversity
When businesses focus on diversity, everyone wins. As a St. Louis Minority Business Council member, we’re committed to identifying and strengthening minority and women-owned businesses.









Environment
We want future generations to thrive. And we do our part by reducing waste, water consumption, power usage and paper dependence. We're a St. Louis Green Business Challenge Award Winner.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Software Meets Customer ExperienceThe MaritzCX platform
turns big data into
business results
The MaritzCX Platform is the big data engine that powers your CX solution—and the complete technology foundation that allows you to quickly collect data from all of your different feedback channels, turn it into a cohesive source of customer information, and make it available to everyone in your organization.
Here are a few of the technology solutions we can offer your business:

REQUEST MORE INFOBring All Your Customer Data TogetherToday, businesses receive crucial customer feedback through dozens (or hundreds) of different channels, from internal operational data and CRM systems to enterprise surveys and social media. The MaritzCX Platform makes sure you can use all of it, by making it easy to capture, collect, integrate, and normalize data from every customer channel—and make it directly available to the people and CX tools that need it.




A Data Collection Engine You Can Depend OnToday, businesses receive crucial customer feedback through dozens (or hundreds) of different channels, from internal operational data and CRM systems to enterprise surveys and social media. The MaritzCX Platform makes sure you can use all of it, by making it easy to capture, collect, integrate, and normalize data from every customer channel—and make it directly available to the people and CX tools that need it.




Add New Data Sources without Relying on ITThe MaritzCX Platform is fast and powerful. It’s also surprisingly easy, thanks to a self-service approach that allows anyone in your organization to add new data sources, design enterprise surveys, create reports, manage samples, administer users, and much more—with minimal training and without involving IT.
A Smart Technology Foundation for Your Entire CX ProgramTurning customer feedback into business results is about much more than simply collecting and storing massive amounts of multi-channel data. With the MaritzCX Platform, every byte of customer data you gather feeds a collection of CX technologies and tools that transform it into actionable information within minutes—from sophisticated text analytics and data mining to responsive dashboards and case management tools.

Frequently Asked QuestionsHow much data can the MaritzCX Platform handle?


The MaritzCX Platform is built to process and analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data quickly—with a robust architecture that features Hadoop, Elastic Search, a NoSQL-based infrastructure, and other proven, enterprise technologies. That means MaritzCX is ready to quickly collect, analyze, and transform all of your customer data into actionable business insights—no matter how large, diverse, or complex your organization becomes.


What types of data sources can we add to the MaritzCX Platform?


Thanks to a wide range of connectors and a flexible integration kit, MaritzCX makes it easy to add data from your own internal systems and a wide range of external data sources, including operational data, CRM tools like SalesForce, social media sites, and more. In most cases, you can add new data sources with drag-and-drop ease—and without involving your IT department.


What’s the best way to deploy the MaritzCX technology platform?


You can deploy the MaritzCX platform as an on-premise solution in your own data center—or as a hosted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution—depending on your organization’s needs and preferences. With the SaaS option, your solution always stays completely up-to-date, and you can get your CX solution up and running quickly and with little or no involvement from IT.
