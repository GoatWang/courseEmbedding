        HL Financial Services acquires Hilliard Lyons

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — HL Financial Services LLC, a newly formed company owned by employees of Hilliard Lyons and Houchens Industries Inc., has completed the acquisition of Hilliard Lyons from The PNC Financial Services Group.Hilliard Lyons will retain its name, employees and management team and will remain headquartered in Louisville, Ky.

“Today marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the long history of Hilliard Lyons,” said Jim Allen, CEO of Hilliard Lyons, in a press release, “We are very pleased to announce that the employees of Hilliard Lyons have successfully teamed with Houchens Industries, Inc. to complete the purchase of Hilliard Lyons from PNC.”Hilliard Lyons has more than 1,000 employees, including 405 financial consultants, with 76 branches located in Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.Alpha raises $460M from two securities offeringsCoal producer Alpha Natural Resources has raised $460 million from a pair of securities offerings.Alpha says it plans to pay off $175 million in debt with part of the money. The rest could go toward acquisitions, investments in businesses or products, or repaying other debt.Alpha says one of the offerings that closed Monday involved almost 4.2 million shares sold at $41.25 per share.The other involved $287.5 million in low interest convertible notes.Alpha says it also has amended its credit line, increasing the amount it can borrow to $375 million from $275 million.Alpha is based in Abingdon, Va., and operates 58 coal mines in Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky.84 Lumber closes thirty stores nationwide, citing declining housing marketEIGHTY FOUR, Pa.— 84 Lumber Co. said Monday it is closing another 30 stores across the country, but stores in West Virginia apparently will not be affected.Frank Cicero, the privately held company’s executive vice president of store operations, said Monday the move will help 84 Lumber weather the housing market decline.The store closings will affect about 230 employees, according to spokesman Jeff Nobers. States affected include Arizona, Texas, Florida, California, New Jersey, North Carolina and Ohio.Last month, 84 Lumber consolidated nine stores into other facilities.84 Lumber has 368 stores and 13 manufacturing facilities in 37 states.

Several stores and plants are “mothballed” and will reopen when conditions allow, the company said.The company has stores in Huntington, Milton, Ashland and St. Albans.UPS cuts 1Q profit due to higher fuel costsATLANTA — United Parcel Service Inc., the world’s largest shipping carrier, cut its first-quarter profit guidance Tuesday, citing lower volume and higher fuel costs.The company said it now expects earnings per share of 86 cents or 87 cents.Previously, the company said it expected first quarter profit between 94 cents and 98 cents per share.Atlanta-based UPS said a shift away from premium products and higher fuel costs also contributed to the guidance cut.The move comes after the company warned last month it may not meet first-quarter earnings guidance and plans to focus more on growth opportunities overseas because of the uncertain U.S. economy.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Mondelez International (NYSE:KFT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
