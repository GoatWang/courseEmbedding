Synthesis of the Missing Oxide of Xenon, XeO2, and Its Implications for Earth’s Missing XenonDavid S. Brock and Gary J. Schrobilgen* Department of Chemistry, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4M1, CanadaJ. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, 133 (16), pp 6265–6269DOI: 10.1021/ja110618gPublication Date (Web): February 22, 2011Copyright © 2011 American Chemical Societyschrobil@mcmaster.caAbstractThe missing Xe(IV) oxide, XeO2, has been synthesized at 0 °C by hydrolysis of XeF4 in water and 2.00 M H2SO4(aq). Raman spectroscopy and 16/18O isotopic enrichment studies indicate that XeO2 possesses an extended structure in which Xe(IV) is oxygen bridged to four neighboring oxygen atoms to give a local square-planar XeO4 geometry based on an AX4E2 valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) arrangement. The vibrational spectra of Xe16O2 and Xe18O2 amend prior vibrational assignments of xenon doped SiO2 and are in accordance with prior speculation that xenon depletion from the Earth’s atmosphere may occur by xenon insertion at high temperatures and high pressures into SiO2 in the Earth’s crust. Supporting InformationHydrolyses of [Cs][XeOF3] and XeOF2; synthesis of XeO2 in nonaqueous media; site symmetry analyses for the XeO4 moiety in the polymeric structure of XeO2 (Table S1); Natural abundance Raman spectra of yellow-orange, incompletely polymerized product(s) and yellow, macromolecular XeO2 (Figure S1).

The previously reported α-phase (orthorhombic, ...The highly shock-sensitive binary xenon oxide, XeO3, crystallizes in three phases, α-, β-, and γ-XeO3, which have been characterized by low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The α phase was obtained upon evaporation of XeO3 dissolved in aqueous HF, whereas the β phase was only obtained upon slow evaporation of an aqueous solution of XeO3. The γ phase was obtained by the rapid evaporation of CH3CH2CN or aqueous solutions of XeO3. The structures of all three phases are best described as networks formed through secondary Xe---O bonds. The α and γ phases of solid XeO3 and a concentrated aqueous solution of XeO3 were also characterized by Raman spectroscopy.Abstract | Full Text HTML | PDF w/ Links | Hi-Res PDFThe Chemistry of Xenon(IV)Chemical ReviewsHaner and Schrobilgen2015 115 (2), pp 1255–1295Abstract | Full Text HTML | PDF w/ Links | Hi-Res PDFXeOF3−, an Example of an AX3YE2 Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Arrangement; Syntheses and Structural Characterizations of [M][XeOF3] (M = Cs, N(CH3)4)Journal of the American Chemical SocietyBrock, Mercier and Schrobilgen2010 132 (31), pp 10935–10943Abstract: The XeOF3− anion has been synthesized as its Cs+ and N(CH3)4+ salts and structurally characterized in the solid state by low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations.
