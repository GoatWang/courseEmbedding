Bioprinted Human Tissue

Organovo’s proprietary bioprinting platform captures the unique synergistic potential of engineering and biology to enable the reproducible, automated creation of living human tissues that mimic the form and function of native tissues in the body. Genomics and proteomics have revolutionized research through the creation of highly reproducible tools for studying the genome and proteome.

Organovo’s scientific founder, Gabor Forgacs, presents on bioprinting at TEDMED.
Our goal is to build living human tissues that are proven to function like native tissues for in vitro and therapeutic applications.
Organovo’s ExVive™ 3D Bioprinted Human Tissues are developed for use in Organomics™, the study of living organs in vitro. Our 3D bioprinted human tissues are constructed with precision from tiny building blocks made of living human cells, using a process that translates tissue-specific geometries and cellular components utilizing the NovoGen Bioprinter® Platform. These bioprinted tissues share many key features with native tissue, including tissue-like cellular density, presence of multiple cell types, and the development of key architectural and functional features associated with the target native tissue.
Significant science and discovery is required to develop a tissue therapy, ensure safety and efficacy through controlled clinical trials, and gain regulatory clearance as a medical device. Supplemental tissue therapies that could come in forms of tubes, patches, or organoids are a developmental possibility today.

Bioprinting Process

Organovo’s bioprinting process centers around the identification of key architectural and compositional elements of a target tissue, and the creation of a design that can be utilized by a bioprinter to generate that tissue in the laboratory environment.
Once a tissue design is established, the first step is to develop the bioprocess protocols required to generate the multi-cellular building blocks—also called bio-ink—from the cells that will be used to build the target tissue.
The bio-ink building blocks are then dispensed from a bioprinter, using a layer-by-layer approach that is scaled for the target output. Bio-inert hydrogel components may be utilized as supports, as tissues are built up vertically to achieve three-dimensionality, or as fillers to create channels or void spaces within tissues to mimic features of native tissue.
The bioprinting process can be tailored to produce tissues in a variety of formats, from micro-scale tissues contained in standard multi-well tissue culture plates, to larger structures suitable for placement onto bioreactors for biomechanical conditioning prior to use.

See how we create functional human tissues starting with cells from any source.

Organovo Holdings, Inc.'s Biggest Win in 2016
Organovo more than tripled its revenue in 2016 compared to the prior year, but its biggest win of all was something different.











                Keith Speights
            

                (TMFFishBiz)



            
            Dec 13, 2016 at 7:03AM
            
            





This turned out to be great year for Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO). Shares of the 3D-bioprinting company climbed over 30% during 2016. Organovo had several important developments during the year, but what was the company's biggest win?

Image source: Getty Images
Launch of second commercial product
In September, Organovo announced the launch of its second commercial product, ExVive human kidney tissue. This kidney tissue enables customers to study the effects of drug exposure in the human kidney as part of their drug discovery and development processes. The company's first product, ExVive human liver tissue, hit the market in 2014.
Organovo was receiving orders for its new 3D-bioprinted kidney tissue even before the launch was announced. The company said that multiple contracts had been signed, including with two of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The primary benefit to customers for using the 3D-bioprinted kidney tissue is that it can allow drugmakers to detect toxicity earlier than conventional approaches such as animal testing. This early detection can potentially save pharmaceutical companies a lot of money.
Why was this the biggest win of the year for Organovo? The addition of a second product immediately added to the company's revenue growth. It also opened up a new market that is a natural extension to Organovo's liver tissue business. Organovo's executives think that the kidney tissue business could eventually generate annual revenue of $100 million or more.
Honorable mentions
While the launch of the ExVive human kidney tissue was arguably Organovo's biggest win in 2016, the company did have several other successes. Honorable mentions go to more than tripling revenue from the prior year and to a couple of important scientific publications and presentations.
In March, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Organovo scientists presented data at the Society of Toxicology's annual meeting. These presentations focused on the benefits and potential of using 3D human liver tissues to detect drug-induced liver toxicity.
In July, researchers from Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) and Organovo published data in the scientific journal PLOS One. This publication discussed the effectiveness of Organovo's human liver tissue in detecting toxicity. In particular, the data compared the 3D-bioprinted liver tissue to traditional pre-clinical testing methods, including animal models. 
Although the collaborations with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche weren't quite as critical as the kidney tissue launch, they were nonetheless important to Organovo's future. The biggest hurdle to the company's success is resistance to adopting the new 3D tissues. Having major customers publicly endorse use of these tissues and citing data to back up why they're going do is huge.





Looking ahead to 2017
I expect Organovo to sustain its momentum in the new year. The company thinks that it will continue to grow revenue by triple-digit percentages well into the future. My hunch is that outlook will be true for 2017, at least.
Look for more presentations and publications in the new year like the ones with Bristol and Roche in 2016. The more Organovo gets the word out with solid data backing up its claims, the more traction it will get.
Organovo plans to expand its offerings to include metabolism studies. That's a smart strategy that fits well with what the company is already doing. Organovo hasn't announced a timeline for its metabolism program efforts. My prediction, though, is that its biggest win in 2017 will be the launch of this new service.

How Risky Is Organovo Holdings, Inc.?
It's not yet profitable. Its products still face some customer skepticism. Is Organovo too risky?











                Keith Speights
            

                (TMFFishBiz)



            
            Sep 12, 2016 at 12:51PM

What a difference a year makes. In 2015, Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) lost nearly two-thirds of its market cap. This year, though, the 3D bioprinting leader's stock is up over 50% so far. Organovo just launched its second product, ExVive human kidney tissue. Shareholders are probably feeling more confident than they have in quite a while. But just how risky is Organovo right now?
Dilution
When the cash begins to run out for a company that has yet to reach profitability, the primary options available are to either borrow or raise money through a secondary stock offering. If the company takes the latter route, existing shares are diluted in value and the stock price typically takes a beating.
Organovo reported $53.5 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of June 30. The company also posted a loss of just under $8.8 million in its last quarter. Simple math shows that Organovo can't keep on losing that amount of money for too long before more cash will be needed.
I expect Organovo's bottom line will improve, however, especially with its kidney tissue now on the market. That should allow the company to stretch out its cash. I don't think there's an immediate dilution risk for Organovo, but I wouldn't be surprised if the company issued more shares within the next year or so. 
Inertia
If you asked Organovo CEO Keith Murphy what his company's biggest challenges are, it's quite likely that he'd include winning over customers who remain skeptical about 3D bioprinted tissues. Organovo faces something akin to the physics law of inertia. It can be difficult to get a customer to move to something new.
The risk for Organovo is that this customer inertia could potentially result in a much longer time frame required for the company to reach profitability. It could also prevent the company from achieving its long-range vision of making $100 million and more in annual revenue.
How significant is this inertia risk? I wouldn't underestimate the challenges that Organovo faces. The company's exVive3D human liver tissue has been commercially available since November 2014 and will probably generate less than $6 million in the company's current fiscal year.
On the other hand, Organovo is making headway. Merck (NYSE:MRK) became one of the first major drugmakers to join forces with Organovo. The two companies entered into a multiyear research collaboration in April 2015 to develop custom tissue models using Organovo's bioprinting platform. Merck also gained access to exVive3D human liver tissue for use in its drug development efforts.
Organovo is also trying to influence perception of 3D tissues through scientific publications. In July, researchers from Organovo and Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) published an article in PLOS One that described advantages for using Organovo's 3D bioprinted human liver tissue in drug development.  





Competition
Keith Murphy has downplayed the threat from competition in the past. When asked about other 3D bioprinting companies, Murphy replied that Organovo's rivals only had small percentages of market share and were "not a major driver" in terms of competition.
My impression is that Organovo is doing a better job of marketing itself than others -- for now, at least. Collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies give credibility that smaller rivals won't have. 
I wouldn't be too dismissive of competitive risks, however. In some ways, Organovo's success in winning customers like Merck and Roche could help pave the way for those same companies to entertain 3D bioprinted products from other suppliers. Privately held n3D Biosciences is one smaller rival that is talking to some of the same prospects that Organovo is going after.
How risky?
Organovo's stock is without question risky. But so is every stock. The question investors must ask themselves is whether the level of risk is acceptable for the potential rewards owning the stock could bring. The answer to this question will vary by investor. 
While I suspect dilution will happen at some point, that's just a temporary negative for investors. It's still early in the game for 3D human tissues. I think recognition of the advantages in detecting drug toxicity will increase dramatically over the next two to three years, resulting in a decrease in the inertia risk.
If I'm right, Organovo should reap the rewards. Its rivals could also benefit, but I think Organovo will be the biggest winner. My take is that Organovo's stock isn't too risky, considering the possibilities for its technology.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
