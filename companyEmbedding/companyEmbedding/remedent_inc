GLAMSMILE VENEERS
GlamSmile, features a unique tray delivery system that allows simple, fast seating of a full arch of high quality, ultra thin veneers, all in one smooth single movement.
 
Unlike traditional one-veneer-at-a-time placement methodology, proprietary GlamSmile technology makes creating a beautiful smile with veneers a time-saving, comfortable treatment as well for the dentist and the patient.


The high quality GlamSmile veneers provide a fast, painless and affordable cosmetic dental solution for patients with severely stained, misshapen, chipped, misaligned and discolored teeth.

SMILE CONSULTANCY
Do you have questions about the aesthetics of your teeth? Would you also like to know your options for a stunning smile?
 
GlamSmile offers personalised advice. The principle is easy: make an appointment, free of obligation, with one of our Smile Consultants. He/she will assist you from A to Z: an appointment will be made in one of the GlamSmile Studios or with one of our GlamSmile partner dentists.


After an extensive - but quick! - photo shoot and an exploratory conversation, the dentist will look at your teeth and make an analysis. Armed with that information the dentist will discuss with you your options for life with a radiant new smile.

The Opening of GlamSmile Madrid
Last week I attended the opening of the GlamSmile Studio in Madrid. It is our franchise partner, José Avila, his first studio for GlamSmile Iberica. I was really impressed by the look and the feeling the Studio gave me. GlamSmile Spain did an exquisite job in installing their first studio, located in Calle de Goya 102, Madrid. There even was a ‘GlamSmile Scent’ in the Studio.
To launch their Studio GlamSmile Madrid was present at the Madrid Fashion Week. Check out some pictures of the new studio here, a picture of the Madrid Fashion Week you can see here.
I wish our new franchises partner all the luck with their new Studio and may it be the first of many in Portugal and Spain!

GlamSmile Hong Kong and their new VIP lunch concept with celebrities
“Just got back from Hong Kong where former Miss Hong Kong hosted a VIP lunch highlighting GlamSmile. Great concept we want to enroll in other cities too! Top veneer clients invited their jetset family & friends for an exquisite lunch in Hong Kong’s outstanding Conrad Hotel. Also the press attended to see how 2 Chinese celebrities (who are great GlamSmile ambassadors) were interviewed by Miss Hong Kong in between delicious courses (see picture attached). All guests were very excited about the location, lunch, the celebs, the information and the concept of this refined approach.
A recent try-out by our Chinese partner Mr David Lok for advertising not the Smile Consultancy concept but the veneer product itself has delivered excellent results. Check here how GlamSmile talks in China’s Next Magazine about the width of veneers, the strength in megaspascal, the high quality porcelain, and the 3D technology. Very interesting approach with great results!”

another glamsmile asia record for the month of may

	As i stated in my previous update. We were on track to have a thrid record in a row. We did - thanks to a good start in Wenzhou. Beijing studio always on a roll. Hong Kong on target. Shanghai due to some personell shift a little under expectations, but that should be resolved in the month of JUne. Looks like we are on track to start working on a new studio in Changsha.

	That is it for now.
May. 29th 2012
Wenzhou

	A lot of exciting things happening. Our Chinese studios have posted 2 record months back to back and are on track to do this for the 3 rd month in a row. Our Beijing studio (oldest one) is doing increasinly better. We are signing two more studios in June for opening after the summer. We are currently tracking between 3.3 and 3.5 million rmb on a monthly basis. Our goal is to reach a run rate of 10 million rmb per month in 12 months time. That would put us in a perfect position to start thinking listing in HK for 2014. Our ebitda is still incredible, cash flow positive and 5 million usd investment in the bank. In the early part of May we had the official opening of the Wnzhou store. We got our license the month before.

	On the franchise front. We had a big meeting with our franchisees in April. A lot of excitement there as well. We look forward in the opening of 3 more of our franchises at the end of this quarter.

	 

	This is our year end closing so a little more patience with the release of numbers.

Rome

	Ciao everybody,

	Rome is open. We started our online lead generation program this past monday. Next week the studio (beautiful studio- located on via del corso) on a first floor. Heavy foot traffic right where the action is. Fingers crossed. Our first days of lead generation went very very well. Lead generation is the key to our businnes. Chair in , chair out. It always starts with chair in. The first 3 appointments were booked for next week.

	I personally like to welcome our new collegues in Rome. I also encourage all our investors to come and have a peek in this studio - in one of my favourite cities in the world. Rome is the epitome of good taste and we belong there.

	The studio is managed by Beniamion Silberstein. I have known Benny for many years and believe he is ready to make an absolute success of this studio.

	I will be heading soon to Wenzhou for the opening of our 4 th China store. Hopefully within the next 2 weeks the studio will be open. It promises to be another beautiful studio.

China update
			On my way to beijing for the first annual dinner meeting for all Glamsmile Asia employees. David as always has done an impeccable job and I am sure he is looking forward to Saturday. we have just opened our new lab facility in Beijijng in order to handle the increased orders from our China stores. Sales in all three facilities in China are going very strong and my gut feeling tells me that we could be heading for a new record. Time has come to increase our advertising spending per store.. So far so good. The increased spending seem to be paying off. Given the fact that the cities we operate in and the fact that all studios are equipped with 4 operatories we are perfectly situated to handle more businnes per store. This year goal is to open both Wenzhou and Guanzhou in addition to our 3 existing stores.		  			Dec. 22nd 2010
shanghai
			OUr story in China continues. The official opening of our studio in Shanghai will be in the week of February 21 st. We plan on a grand opening and have invited a number of journalists to join us in Shanghai. We further have started talk to obtain licenses for Wenzhou and Chengdu. 2 tier cities but with incredible potential. Our goal is to open before the summer.This week we also started a new advertising campaign in luxury magazines. The january issue just came out (Harper Bazaar magazine).The initial days are very promising. A good number of inquiries and a good number of appointments already set.		  			Dec. 15th 2010
Hong Kong and Beijing
			On my way to Beijing today. Just visited the Hong Kong studio that is off to another great start in December. Evelyne is with me and is assisting in training new dentists hired in Hong Kong- Today she will witness two placements and assist if needed. Since we changed our model - it has become much easier to keep the quality up as we have to worry about few denitst doing a lot of cases versus a lot of dentist doing few cases. Our studio dentist follow a strict regimen which limits mistakes.
Tommorrow I am going to see the new facility we are building in Beijing. This new faciliity will house all of our design and technical staff and will make room for milling machines We intend to start milling versus pressing in China towards the middle of next year. Another facility is dedicated to train dentist and smile consultants to staff our future studio's in China. China never seizes to amaze me. Everytime I look at the numbers and the potenital I get more excited.
Our product is so right for this market. A vast rising middle and upper class with traditionally very bad teeth and a coutnry where beauty has become a status symbol. I could not have dreamed up a better market. Tonight I have dinner with a potential partner for the city of Wenzhou.		  			Dec. 14th 2010
Progres
			Recently i received an e mail from an investor asking me whether the blog was a yearly blog. So here i am rushing to the deadline to make sure it doesn,t take a year. But he is right and i apologize. However there was a lot of news and excitement to cover. Our change from exclusive b to b to a holding hand approach b to c has been an fantastic turnaround for the company. In the direct model we became a completely integrated businnes. From chair in (anything to do with getting new customers to our studios) to chair out (anything to do with design to production to placement) we control everything. The extra margin has predominantly resulted in a superioir product which nobody matches today. Our process is now fully digital from design to millimg ,even the placement trays are digitally printed using our 3 d printers.
Controlling the marketing is key to our businnes. Our product resolves so many issues for millions of people ,they just need to be told about it.
Since our last blog taipei opened, Hong Kong (most succesfull to date) opened. shanghai is under construction for opening after chinese new year.Munchen openend this month and will officially start in consolidation from the first of January. Partners have been found and leases have been signed for studios in Brussels , Milan and Rome in Italy. All these openings will happen towards the end of the March quarters. we have added both operational staff as well as online marketing experts (90% of our leads are generated online.		  			Feb. 15th 2010
Milling
			Very important day last week friday. We got delivery of our state of the art milling machine. It is a machine that is using 5 axis Ultrasonic milling. The incredible advantages for us are the reduced amount of steps needed to get to a perfect veneer. What we design with our software comes out of the machine. No more ovens, no more pressing, no more manual adjusting etc. This machine will add to both our quality as our output capacity. We are getting training in this week with a view to be able to start our first milling production in 30 days.
Besides that exciting news from Taiwan. We were able to close our B to C partnership with Taiwan and will be going over there to start training on March 3rd. The Tsai family is opening the first Glamsmile center on March 10 th.
Adding to this excitement is that on the same trip we make a stop in Hong Kong to witness the opening of our brand new Glamsmile clinic on March 1 st together with our partner David Lok.		  			Dec. 18th 2009
asia trip
			3 asia stops. The first one in Taipei. An interested partner. Hidens. Hidens has 3 clinics in Taipei and wants to start franchising their concept in Taiwan with 50 franchise partners in 2010. Very interesting. Hidens joined us in Beijing where they looked at our concept store. We are currently negotiating a partner license for Taiwan. They would like to open a similar store as the Beijing store in Taipei, potentially converting one of their facilities.
Second stop was Beijing. As always things are progressing nicely in Bejing - we had a visit of a potential franchisee for Korea. He will join us early January for a demo in Belgium. I think he would make a great partner.
Third stop in Asia was Hong KOng. We had previously tested the B to C model in Hong Kong. We have now decided to open up a company owned practice in Hong Kong, as well as continue to work with partner dentists in Hong Kong. Results for the B to C model were extemely encouraging.

PRODUCTS




Remedent Company
 
Remedent Inc. serves consumers and the dental community with unique porcelain veneer, teeth whitening, sensitivity and oral hygiene products that are recognized worldwide for their technological superiority and unique ease-of-application.
 
Headquartered in Belgium, Remedent Inc. manufactures, markets and distributes its products and concepts to more than 35 countries worldwide.
 


Our Activities
Remedent Inc. focuses on both markets: B2B, delivering products to the dental professional as well as B2C, helping consumers to obtain their dream smile through its Smile Consultancy Concept.

Business-to-Business

GlamSmile
Firstfit

Business-to-Consumer

Smile Consultancy Concept
GlamSmile Bejing

Our Management Team





GlamSmile
First proven in Europe and debuting in the U.S. in 2007, Remedent's leading smile improvement system, GlamSmile, revolutionizes the traditional one-at-a-time method of applying porcelain dental veneers.
GlamSmile involves a proprietary veneer fabrication technique and a patented single-motion veneer placement tray which are both guided by a proprietary computer imaging, design and digital preview system. The unique tray delivery system lets dentists expertly seat 10 ultra-thin, custom veneers in less than an hour while preserving tooth structure. All the features of GlamSmile together -CAD/CAM technology, digital preview for dentists to evaluate the design and a unique full arch tray delivery system used in conjunction with minimally or no preparation ultra thin veneers- have revolutionized the art of veneering and transformed already many smiles and lives across the world.
The technology taps a multi-billion dollar international growth market by making the application of dental veneers less traumatic, costly and time-consuming for patients, as well as substantially easier and more profitable for dentists.Remedent Inc. sells its GlamSmile veneer concept both to dental professionals in 18 countries through distributors and through a strategic partnership with Den-Mat Holdings LLC to the rest of the world. Den-Mat is well known as the maker of the popular porcelain veneers Lumineers that have been prominently featured in the national media and on top rated TV shows. More than 10,000 dentists in the US alone offer LUMINEERS. Since the partnership, Den-Mat brings the Remedent technology to its customers under the brand name Lumineers by LumiTray.



FirstFit
The latest Remedent development “FirstFit” features a patent-pending system for the creation and placement of dental crowns and bridges. The FirstFit system requires no temporary placements, creates less mouth trauma and takes fewer office visits to complete. With economic benefits for both patients and dentists, the new technology addresses an expanding U.S. market for dental crowns and bridges, and has the potential to change the way modern dentistry is practiced.









Business-to-consumer

Smile Consultancy Concept
Next to its B2B strategy, Remedent Inc. recently started with a B2C approach based on the Smile Consultancy Concept.
Influenced by the media, Hollywood stars and new trends in the cosmetic industry, many consumers want to improve their smile. They are not particularly looking for a dental treatment but for a comfortable solution to obtain a new smile, a smile solution that should be fast, painless and affordable. GlamSmile is all of that.
GlamSmile’s Smile Consultancy Program aims to help consumers to realize their dream of a beautiful smile through consulting by a Smile Coach. Whilst the concept still works with dentists, the complete sales cycle is taken over by Remedent.
Our approach to market the Smile is predominantly internet based. An intensive campaign aims to generate as much traffic as possible to our website that promotes GlamSmile Whitening, Veneers ànd Free Smile Advice. Visitors can apply for a free Smile Consultation by a Smile Consultant. The latter guides the consumer to the right GlamSmile Studio and to the solution that meets best his or her Smile expectations.
For this Smile Consultancy Program, Remedent sets up close partnerships with dedicated GlamSmile dentists and creates GlamSmile Studios.
Remedent strongly believes in this successful and proven approach and is expanding this B2C concept all over the world.







GlamSmile Beijing
This is one of the reasons why Remedent Inc. took a partnership in GlamSmile Beijing, that has two important activities:

After an extensive - but quick! - photo shoot and an exploratory conversation, the dentist will look at your teeth and make an analysis. Armed with that information the dentist will discuss with you your options for life with a radiant new smile.

The Company's operating segment consists of dental products and oral hygiene products sold by Remedent Inc., Remedent N.V., and Biotech Dental Benelux N.V. The Company offers over-the-counter (OTC) tooth whitening products. The Company has three primary products: River 8, a prefabricated veneer; its custom-made GlamSmile Veneers, and the SmileMe mirror.River8The Company has developed a range of prefabricated, ready-to-use veneers that the Company has branded as River8. River8 veneers come in over 30 Smile Boxes, each containing a set of approximately eight veneers to cover the smile zone of an upper or lower arch. With over three different shapes, sizes and shades for the upper arch and over one shape, approximately two sizes and over three shades for the lower arch, River8 offers a veneer range across the world.GlamSmile VeneersThe Company's product in the professional oral care and cosmetic dentistry is the GlamSmile veneer. The Company has developed a system for manufacturing and installing dental veneers, which the Company has branded as GlamSmile veneers. GlamSmile veneers are attached to the front of the patient's teeth using a single motion placement tray, which replaces the traditional one at a time trial and error method of applying porcelain veneers, making the application less traumatic for the patient. Its veneers are supported by a line of professional veneer whitening and teeth sensitivity solutions. Its products are sold to professionals by distributors and sold directly to consumers by its GlamSmile Studios. Its GlamSmile involves a veneer fabrication technique and a single-motion veneer placement tray, which are both guided by a computer imaging, design and digital preview system. The tray delivery system lets dentists seat over 10 ultra-thin, custom veneers in less than an hour.The GlamSmile veneers are ultra-thin claddings made from a mixture of a hybrid composite and porcelain materials, which are attached to the front of the patient's teeth. Its veneers are custom-made for each individual's personal features, taking into account various factors, including the shape of a person's face, the shape of their lips and more.SmileMe MirrorThe SmileMe Mirror enables the dentist to offer patients a complete Smile Consultation in approximately 10 minutes. The SmileMe Mirror has a range of applications to assist the dentist with every step of Smile Consultancy, including the use of SmileSketch to visualize the potential of smile makeover, discover what the patient actually desires with Smile Analysis, or explain the benefits of certain treatments with its various Treatment Pages. The functionality of the SmileMe Mirror, SmileSketch, is a simulation software. By using the wireless and touch-screen technologies, the dentist needs approximately 30 seconds to make a sketch of what the patient could look like.

Remedent, Inc. to Demonstrate "Metatray'' Tooth Whitening System at Chicago Dental Society's Midwinter Meeting



Published on 2006-02-24. Author :
SpecialChem













EL SEGUNDO, Calif -- Remedent, Inc. (OTC BB: REMI - News),
a leader in the research and development, manufacturing and marketing
of oral care and cosmetic dentistry products, announced that it will demonstrate
its Metatray tooth whitening system at the Midwinter Meeting of
the Chicago Dental Society. The meeting begins February 24 at Chicago's
Lakeside Center at McCormick Place and runs through February 26.
The demonstrations will take place at Remedent's booth
(#2561) throughout the course of the convention.
In addition, representatives of HANSAmed Limited, of Ontario, Canada,
will be at Remedent's booth during the convention. HANSAmed has recently
signed a distribution agreement with Remedent to make the Metatray tooth
whitening system available in Canada. Remedent sees this as a significant
step toward a substantial market presence in North America. Remedent is
also pursuing similar agreements with companies in the United States.
The Metatray combined with the Meta foam strips form a revolutionary
new whitening solution that brings an extra dimension to teeth whitening.
It is also the world's first 'at home' power bleaching system. It produces
high quality, long-lasting results similar to in-office procedures. The
Metatray concept is the first whitening system that combines the traditional
mouth tray with the latest technology in light and heat energy. These
are critical elements to enhance the whitening process of the Meta foam
strips and dramatically shorten the treatment time.
Reality Publishing Company, which serves the dental community with product
reports and whose flagship publication Reality is considered the "bible
of cosmetic dentistry," has nominated Remedent's Metatray for an
award in the category of "Most Unique First Look."
Remedent, Inc., a publicly listed company trading on the OTCBB, strives
to be a world leader in the research and development, manufacturing and
marketing of oral care and cosmetic dentistry products. Remedent products
are renowned for their technological superiority and ease-of-use. Based
in Deurle, Belgium, Remedent has successfully researched, developed and
manufactured all of its own products. These products are now distributed
in more then 35 countries worldwide. Remedent consists of two divisions:
one that serves the dental community and one that is focused on the over-the-counter
consumer market.
Certain matters discussed in this press release are "forward-looking
statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability
established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In
particular, the Company's statements regarding trends in the marketplace
and potential future results are examples of such forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, including,
but not limited to, the consummation and the successful integration of
proposed acquisitions, the timing of projects due to the variability in
size, scope and duration of projects, estimates made by management with
respect to the Company's financial results, backlog, critical accounting
policies, regulatory delays, clinical study results which lead to reductions
or cancellations of projects, and other factors, including general economic
conditions and regulatory developments, not within the Company's control.
The factors discussed herein and expressed from time to time in the Company's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual
results and developments to be materially different from those expressed
in or implied by such statements. The forward-looking statements are made
only as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect
subsequent events or circumstance.

The company also offers professional cosmetic solutions called GlamSmile and River 8, including a prefab veneer that enables dentists to make sure patients always obtain a permanent white smile and perfectly aligned dentition when minor reshaping is required. In addition, Remedent is launching a host of products and digital applications that accompany dental scanners.

05/10/2002




Remedent USA, Inc. (OTCBB:REMM), a developer and worldwide supplier of high-technology dental equipment and oral hygiene products, today announced it has reached an agreement with a third party distributor for the sale of the Company's Remedent Tooth & Gumbrush division.
The division, which engages in the worldwide distribution of theRemedent Tooth & Gumbrush, had been the sole revenue-generating activity of the Company since its creation in 1996. However, due to recurring net losses and increasing working capital and shareholder deficits, the Company implemented, in July 2001, a complete corporate reorganization plan. This plan included the ceasing of direct sales and marketing of the Remedent Tooth & Gumbrush, and acquisition of andexpansion into diversified business ventures.
Under the terms of the agreement, the purchaser will receive theRemedent Tooth & Gumbrush division and assume the liabilities relating to this division. As the liabilities of this division exceed the value of the division's business assets, the Company will issue 750,000 shares of common stock in consideration for the purchaser agreeing to receive the division and its related liabilities. This transaction, which the Company expects to result in a gain, will still need to be approved by the Company's shareholders.
The Company has been developing technologies for introductionwithin the professional dental equipment market, and initiatedshipments of its first product, a high-speed dental curing light, inthe first quarter 2002. Additionally, also during the first quarter of2002, the Company completed the acquisition of a dental employee outsourcing firm in Belgium.
"Reaching this agreement regarding our Tooth & Gumbrush division marks the near completion of our corporate reorganization," said Remedent Chief Financial Officer Stephen F. Ross. "As our focus shifts to high technology professional dental equipment we feel our resources are better served within this market. Since inception the Tooth & Gumbrush division has generated losses and rising deficits, and we do not feel our continued dedication to this business is in our shareholders' best interest."
With operations in the United States and Europe, the Company[Native Advertisement]develops and markets high-technology dental equipment within the professional dental market. The Company's objective is to become a leading developer and manufacturer of high-technology dental equipment and operator of employee leasing firms, capitalizing on the synergies and marketing inroads each division provides.

Remedent, Inc. Signs Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Chefaro Pharma Italia; Remedent's Tooth Whitening Products Shipped to Italy, Vatican City and San Marino; Initial Order Valued at EUR 1.4 Million (US $1.7 Million)






May 02, 2006 12:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time

On April 26, 2006, Remedent received Chefaro Italia's initial order for the iWhite(TM) Tooth Whitening System, and it expects the revenue from this initial order, approximately EUR 1.4 million (US $1.7 million), to be realized in the quarter ending September 30, 2006.  Under the terms of the agreement, Chefaro Italia's sales force will distribute Remedent's iWhite's consumer products to pharmacies throughout Italy, Vatican City and the Republic of San Marino. Chefaro Italia will also have right of first refusal in the same countries for new products Remedent is developing. Remedent has similar exclusive distribution agreements for Spain, France, Portugal and Greece. These seven nations combined represent a market of more than 180 million consumers.  Robin List, CEO of Remedent, said, "We are very pleased to have made this arrangement with Chefaro Italia. With a population of over 58 million, Italy is a significant European market for any consumer product company. Teaming up with Chefaro Italia ensures that our tooth whitening products will get the exceptional distribution and promotion in this vital market that they merit. This agreement will help us establish a solid market share quickly. We look forward to broadening and deepening this relationship."  Marco Sbaffi, CEO of Chefaro Pharma Italia, commented: "As exclusive territory distributor, we are very happy to commercialize iWhite, the innovative whitening system built upon Remedent's highly professional oral care and cosmetic knowledge. iWhite fills a very fast growing consumer need with a unique, easy-to-use home whitening program.
