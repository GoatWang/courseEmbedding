Andre Hoffmann's fortune is derived from a 1.5 percent stake in publicly traded drugmaker Roche Holding. Hoffmann holds his stake in bearer shares that bestow voting rights on the holder. Roche is the world's third-largest pharmaceutical company based on 2016 sales, according to the Pharmaceutical Executive website.
Hoffmann controls the shares along with the other living descendants of Fritz Hoffmann who founded Roche forerunner, F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. in 1896. Through a family voting pool that includes eight shareholders, the family controls 72 million Roche shares, giving them 45 percent voting control of the company and a 8.3 percent equity interest. Hoffmann's cousin Maja Oeri holds a 1 percent interest outside of the voting pool. Hoffmann's father Lukas, who left the voting pool in 2004, died in July 2016. His holding has been split evenly among his three children identified as belonging to the family pool.
Andre's cousin Beatrice Oeri sold her shares in Roche back to the family and exited the pool in 2009. Two years later, another cousin, Maja Oeri, broke from the pool, while continuing to hold onto her shares. That year Roche disclosed her individual holdings, 8.1 million shares, which represents 0.9 percent of the company's equity and 5 percent of its voting rights. Andre Hoffmann's holdings are calculated on the basis of these disclosures, as well as an analysis of the holdings back to 2000, when some of the family's individual stakes were disclosed. 
Hoffmann also owns 14 percent of publicly traded U.S. healthcare analytics company, Inovalon, according to a May 2016 Form 4 filing with the SEC. His cash holdings are valued based on an analysis of dividends, market performance, insider transactions, taxes and charitable contributions.
Andre Hoffmann declined to comment on his net worth in an e-mailed statement.

Andre Hoffmann was born in 1958 and is the great-grandson of Fritz Hoffmann who, in 1896, founded the forebear of drugmaker Roche Holding, the world's fourth largest pharmaceutical company. Together with other family members he retains voting control over the Swiss company that today employs more than 88,500 people and operates in 150 countries worldwide.
Notable acquisitions by the medical firm include the purchase of Corange in 1998, a Bermuda-based holding company that owned Mannheim, Germany-based drug and diagnostics company Boehringer Mannheim for $10.2 billion dollars in cash. That transaction solidified the fortune of Germany's Engelhorn family, including Curt Engelhorn, who was Boehringer's CEO for 37 years. Roche completed the purchase of San Francisco-based biotech Genentech Inc., for $46.8 billion in 2009.
Since 1996 Andreas Hoffmann has been a non-executive board member of Roche as well as vice president of conservation organization World Wildlife Fund that his father Lukas Hoffmann helped establish.
