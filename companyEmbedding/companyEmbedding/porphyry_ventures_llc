Emerald Isle







Emerald Isle Copper Oxide Deposit

Napier Ventures Inc. has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Emerald Copper Corp., whereby the company will acquire a 100-per-cent interest in 57 unpatented mining claims in Mohave county, Arizona, as well as 21 unpatented mining claims in Dolores county, Colorado.

Napier plans to focus on the Emerald Isle property. The Emerald Isle property is located entirely on federal Bureau of Land Management-managed lands on unpatented mining claims situated in Mohave county, Arizona. The mine is about 20 miles north of Kingman, Ariz., and about 1.5 miles west of the Mineral Park copper porphyry.

Considerable exploration has been done at the Emerald Isle property in the past by several companies, including El Paso Mining and Milling Company, Arimetco, St. Genevieve Resources Ltd. and Sierra Resources Group Inc. Historical mining at the Emerald Isle property was of high-grade oxide copper by underground methods, followed by a small open-pit copper recovery by leaching and electrowinning. Past production is estimated by the U.S. Bureau of Mines at 1.4 million tonnes averaging 1 per cent copper.

In March, 2006, Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. prepared a mineral resource estimate for St. Genevieve in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, which provided indicated mineral resources of the Emerald Isle copper deposit as 2.22 million tonnes with an average grade of 0.62 per cent total copper (based on compilation of 135 drill holes totalling in excess of 30,000 feet, a total copper cut-off grade of 0.3 per cent total copper and 10-foot minimum vertical thickness).

Napier is not aware of any more recent mineral resource estimates. No qualified person has done sufficient work to classify the mineral resource estimate in the Roscoe technical report as current mineral resources, and Napier is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource.

Geology

Copper mineralization at the Emerald Isle property is hosted by late Tertiary conglomerates and, to a lesser extent, by Quaternary alluvium and Cretaceous granitic rocks. Mineralization at Emerald Isle property is in the form of mineralized lenses contained within a paleochannel approximately a few thousand feet long and up to 750 feet wide. The source of copper at the Emerald Isle property is interpreted to be the low-grade porphyry-type copper mineralization at Alum Wash, about 3.5 miles northeast of the Emerald Isle property deposit, or the mineralized intrusion directly underlying the property. 

The mineralization is characterized by dark blue to black copper oxide and carbonate-cemented conglomerate rock similar to the Exotica deposit, a satellite of the Chuquicamata copper deposit in Chile.

There is a well-defined oxide copper zone on the property at the base of the Gila conglomerate or fanglomerate. This zone, long hypothesized to originate from the Alum Wash area, is uphill and to the northeast of the Emerald Isle pit. What is not generally known is that many of the previous drill holes at Emerald Isle end in altered or unaltered Tertiary-age or Cretaceous-age intrusive material (loosely termed porphyry) and that many of these drill holes stop in what could be economic grades of mineralization. Also, based on limited geological descriptions, many holes were stopped prematurely in mineralized conglomerate. Thus, there could be a large local porphyry copper deposit immediately underlying part of the drilled area.

Although the mineralized intrusive may be cut off to the north of the pit, the southwest and northwest limits of mineralized intrusion have not been found. Essentially, there is a large mineralized porphyry system immediately underlying the oxide channel in the conglomerates, and this porphyry, though low grade, covers an area roughly 2,500 feet by 1,000 feet, open in several directions. While the 440-foot drill hole completed in 2013 did not intersect significant mineralization, anomalous copper, cadmium and zinc were noted in the analysis of the chips.

Claim Dispute

Sierra Resource Group Inc. , which also holds claims in the area, was a U.S.-based exploration and mining company which previously had an 80-per-cent ownership of its Emerald Isle property mining claims. Sierra is based in Las Vegas, Nev., and as of June, 2015, was placed into bankruptcy. As part of the bankruptcy process, certain assets of Sierra were purchased from a receiver by Sunburst Minerals LLC. Sunburst is asserting ownership of certain claims that overlap with the Emerald Isle property claims. As a result, the status of claims once held by Sierra is uncertain, and litigation is in process. Napier and its consultants have examined numerous claim posts belonging to the vendor in the field and believe them to be properly staked. Napier engaged a consultant to undertake a title review which found numerous defects in the location of many of the former Sierra claims.
Napier staked the Emerald Isle property claims with the BLM on the basis of open ground in some areas and the probability that some of the Sierra claims, particularly the mill site claims are in contravention of one or more clauses of the 1872 mining law. As a result of its review, Napier believes that Emerald Isle property claims cover a large and partly overlapping portion of the Emerald Isle property copper deposit and may be explored and developed where they do not conflict with land covered by any valid third party unpatented mining claims. Napier intends to assert its rights to and explore the Emerald Isle property with geological mapping and mineral exploration activities.

Conclusions

The Emerald Isle oxide copper property is a property of merit with NI-43-101 compliant resources and exploration potential at depth, as a mineralized porphyry exists under the oxide capping or channels and many drillholes stopped in mineralization. While there are some conflicting claims held by others, the present author concurs with the mineral surveyors that Emerald Copper Corp.'s claims are validly staked, cover a larger and partly overlapping portion of the Emerald Isle copper deposit, and may be explored and developed where they do not conflict with any validly staked and held claims which may co-exist.

			Freegold Ventures Expands Porphyry Targets at Shorty Creek		



                        Alaska                    




Freegold Ventures Limited (TSX: FVL) ("Freegold) is pleased to provide final assays from its successful summer 2016 drilling program at its Shorty Creek Project, ("Shorty Creek"), located approximately 125 kilometres by paved road north west of Fairbanks, Alaska. Seven holes (3,038 metres) were completed during the summer program, as well as additional ground geophysics and geochemical sampling.
Freegold's first diamond drill program in 2015 discovered significant copper–gold mineralization after stepping out from the previous shallow reverse circulation drilling completed by Asarco in 1989-1990 and confirmed the copper mineralization extended to depth. The 2016 holes extended the copper mineralization intercepted in SC 15-03 by over 245 metres to the southwest and to depth. (PR: dated November 16th, 2015) Hole SC 16-01 located 125 metres southwest of SC 15-03 intersected 434.5 metres grading 0.57% copper equivalent**. Hole SC 16-02 a further 120 metres southwest of SC 16-01 intercepted 409.6 metres grading 0.41% copper equivalent***, with both holes ending in mineralization. (See Press Releases: September 8th, 2016, and October 26th, 2016)
The magnetic anomaly over Hill 1835 covers an area measuring 700 metres by 1,000 metres and appears to be directly associated with the mineralization.
Mineralization on Hill 1835 was intersected in drill holes to a minimum depth of 500 metres and remains open in all directions. Mineralization consists of sulphide quartz stockwork veining and sulphide disseminations within strong secondary biotite alteration and anhydrite primarily situated within a flysch unit intruded by quartz feldspar porphyry sills and/or dykes.  Disseminated and fracture-controlled pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and bornite have been identified (along with numerous secondary oxide minerals) in drill core. In addition to the significant Cu, Au and Ag mineralization reported from the 2016 drilling significant tungsten was also intersected in hole SC 16-01 which included 359 ppm W (0.045% WO3) over 207 metres and in SC 16-02 tungsten values averaging 252 ppm W (0.03 % WO3) over 409.6 metres including a higher grade interval of 519 ppm W (0.065% WO3) over 93.5 metres.
Five drill holes (2019.8 m) collared on Hill 1710, located 2.5 km northwest of Hill 1835, tested a large magnetic anomaly and a coincident copper-molybdenum soil anomaly. The magnetic anomaly strikes northeast-southwest and covers 6,000 metres x 1,500 metres. To date ground geophysics and soil geochemical surveys have been conducted over a small part  (2,500 metres) of this large magnetic anomaly.  The anomaly was tested with 5 holes spaced approximately 400 metres apart starting on the western edge of the soil geochemical anomaly. Each hole intersected both copper and molybdenum mineralization with the copper values increasing as the drilling moved to the northeast. Coincident with the increased assay values was the increasing amount of quartz feldspar porphyry intersected within both holes SC 16-06, and SC 16-07, the two most northeastern holes. Silver values were also elevated in these two holes.
Hole 16-03, drilled to a depth of 257.6 metres, was the most westerly hole drilled and returned 172.6 metres grading 0.03% copper and 0.034% molybdenum. Hole 16-04 was collared approximately 400 metres to the east and intersected 0.05% copper and 0.014% molybdenum over it's entire 426.5 metres length. Hole 16-05 was an angle hole drilled to southeast, aimed at testing the IP chargeability anomaly and encountered abundant fault gauge and broken rock with anomalous values throughout the hole.
Hole SC 16-06 intersected quartz-feldspar porphyry with a coincident higher grade interval including 0.11% copper and 0.02% molybdenum from 25.7 to 147 metres and returned 0.07% copper and 0.01% molybdenum over the entire 516 metres. Hole SC 16-07 intersected 0.11% copper and 0.011% molybdenum from 0-159 metres including 0.15% copper and 0.009% molybdenum from 0-70.8 metres within quartz-feldspar porphyry.  The entire hole averaged 0.08% copper and 0.006% molybdenum over the entire 396 metre length.
A long section showing the holes with the assay values is below. Of particular significance is the presence of consistent mineralization throughout each hole along strike and in the increasing grade to the northeast.
Freegold has not as yet collected sufficient data to determine how the downhole drill intervals might relate to the actual true thickness of mineralization
The 2016 drill program successfully confirmed the presence of a copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry system at Shorty Creek Project, with an alteration/mineralization footprint that covers an area of approximately 10 km in diameter.  The airborne magnetic survey has identified a number of northeast trending magnetic highs. Copper-gold-molybdenum mineralization and associated porphyry alteration has been intersected in drill holes at Hills 1835 and 1710.  Four additional targets (Hill 1890, Hill 1870, Steel Creek and Quarry) have been identified.  All of these targets require follow-up exploration and diamond drilling.
These targets identified which have yet to be drilled are as follows:

Hill 1870 is located approximately two kilometres southwest of Hill 1835. Mineralization and alteration identified on surface indicate strong similarities to Hill 1835. A historical surface rock grab sample assayed 1.05 g/t gold, 2 g/t silver, and 0.38% copper from this area. Mapping has also identified the presence of quartz-feldspar porphyry. 
Steel Creek, located directly northeast of Hill 1835. Additional ground magnetic and geochemical surveys were undertaken on this target during the 2016 exploration program. The Steel Creek anomaly measures 700 metres x 2,000 metres and is associated with a strong magnetic signature similar to Hill 1835.
Hill 1890 is located in the northern portion of the Shorty Creek claim block. Streams draining this area are anomalous in silver, gold, bismuth, molybdenum, antimony, tungsten, copper and zinc.  Rock chip samples are anomalous in silver, arsenic, molybdenum, copper and zinc.
Quarry is located approximately five kilometres east of Hill 1835. A northeast trending magnetic high that is over 10 kilometres in length and associated with stockwork veined quartz-feldspar porphyry was staked during the 2016 exploration program. Ground magnetics and soil geochemistry over a small portion of the 1,000 metre by 10,000 metre anomaly were also completed. Soil geochemistry returned both strong copper and molybdenum values. Surface rock samples returned up to 0.05% copper in oxidized quartz-feldspar porphyry.

Kristina Walcott, President and CEO, stated "The Shorty Creek target represents an exciting porphyry discovery in Alaska that has the potential to host a significant copper-gold-molybdenum resource. We are extremely pleased with the results of the 2016 program and given these highly encouraging results we look forward to further drilling to follow up on this exciting discovery".
Copper equivalent grades are based on metal prices of copper using *US$2.30/lb, gold US$1100 per oz and silver US$15 per oz,, **US$2.09/lb, gold US$1340 per oz and silver US$19 per oz and using ***US$2.15/lb, gold US$1260 per oz and silver US$18 per oz respectively . Metal recoveries have not been applied in the copper equivalent calculation. The copper equivalent calculation is as follows; CuEq = Cu grade +((Au grade x Au price + Ag grade x Ag price)/(22.0462 x 31.1035 x Cu price)).
Drill cores were cut in half using a diamond saw, with one-half placed in sealed bags for geochemical analysis. Core samples were delivered to ALS Chemex at its facility in Fairbanks, Alaska. Quality control/quality assurance program including the insertion and monitoring of appropriate reference material (certified standards, blanks and duplicates) to validate the accuracy and precision of the assay results was implemented. The Qualified Person for technical information disclosed in this release is Alvin Jackson, P.Geo – Vice President Exploration and Development for the Company who is a "Qualified Person" as defined under National Instrument 43-101.
