LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT



Dear Shareholder:


We  are  pleased to present this semiannual report for The Dreyfus Premier Third
Century  Fund,  Inc.,  covering  the  six-month period from June 1, 1999 through
November  30,  1999. Inside, you'll find valuable information about how the fund
was  managed during the reporting period, including a discussion with the fund's
portfolio managers, Paul A. Hilton and Maceo K. Sloan.


When the reporting period began, the U.S. economy was showing signs of continued
strength,  characterized  by  high levels of consumer spending and low levels of
unemployment. These conditions raised concerns among investors that inflationary
pressures  might  re-emerge.  In  response,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board raised
short-term  interest  rates three times during the reporting period in an effort
to forestall inflationary pressures.


Because  higher  interest  rates  tend  to increase the cost of capital and make
fixed-income  securities  more competitive relative to equities, many sectors of
the  stock market declined when the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates.
Technology  stocks,  which  advanced  on  investor  speculation  in  high-flying
Internet  companies, represented one of the few exceptions to this trend. Toward
the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  however,  stocks representing a number of
different market sectors began to rally, as investors became optimistic that the
adverse effects of recent and impending interest-rate increases had already been
incorporated into the prices of most stocks.


We  appreciate  your confidence over the past six months, and we look forward to
your continued participation in The Dreyfus Premier Third Century Fund, Inc.


Sincerely,



Stephen E. Canter




President and Chief Investment Officer




The Dreyfus Corporation

DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE




Paul A. Hilton and Maceo K. Sloan, Portfolio Managers



How did The Dreyfus Premier Third Century Fund, Inc. perform relative to its
benchmark?


For  the  six-month  period  ended  November 30, 1999, The Dreyfus Premier Third
Century  Fund,  Inc.  Class  Z  shares  produced a total return of 15.25%.(1) In
contrast,  the fund's benchmark, the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price
Index  (" S& P  500  Index" ), produced  a  total  return  of 7.36% for the same
period.(2)


The  public  offering  of  the fund's Class A, B, C, R and T shares commenced on
August  31,  1999. From August 31, 1999 to November 30, 1999 the fund achieved a
total  return  of  9.67% for Class A shares, 9.52% for Class B shares, 9.60% for
Class C shares, 9.82% for Class R shares, and 9.15% for Class T shares.


We are very pleased with the fund's returns and attribute our strong performance
to   our   emphasis  on  technology  stocks,  a  market  sector  that  performed
exceptionally  well  over the past six months, and an area in which we made good
choices in our individual stock selection. Our holdings in the consumer cyclical
and    healthcare    groups    also    helped    drive    performance.


What is the fund's investment approach?


The  fund  seeks  to  provide  capital  growth  by  investing  in  high quality,
growth-oriented   companies   that  generally  exhibit  three  characteristics:

improving  profitability  measurements,  a  pattern  of  consistent earnings and
reasonable  prices.  Current  income  is  a secondary objective. To pursue these
goals,  the fund invests primarily in the common stock of companies that, in the
opinion  of  the  fund's management, meet traditional investment standards while
simultaneously  conducting  their businesses in a manner that contributes to the
enhancement of the quality of life in America.



The Fund




DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED)



What other factors influenced the fund's performance?


At the beginning of the six-month reporting period, many overseas economies were
well  into  recovery  from last fall's economic crises. As many global economies
continued  to  strengthen,  investors  became  more  comfortable holding riskier
assets.  At  the  end  of the last reporting period, market sentiment moved away
from  domestic  large-cap growth stocks to include a broader group of companies.
However,  by  the  end  of the summer, the equity markets began to narrow again,
once    again    favoring    large-cap    growth    names.


While  the equity markets have recorded strong gains during the last six months,
those  gains  have  been  accompanied  by  heightened  volatility  in  a  rising
interest-rate  environment.  In  fact,  only a few sectors of the equity markets
performed  well  this  past year -- most of the gains were limited to technology
stocks    and,    to    a    lesser    degree,    telecommunication    stocks.


What is the fund's current strategy?


We  continue  to  maintain  our  strategy  of  seeking  companies  that  produce
consistent  earnings  but  are  reasonably  priced.  While  we currently plan to
maintain our emphasis on technology and healthcare stocks, we have also begun to
increase  our  exposure  to financial stocks because we believe their valuations
have  become attractive. In our view, many financial companies have become adept
at   maintaining   their   companies'   growth  rates  in  rising  interest-rate
environments.   We  are  particularly  interested  in  companies  with  a  large
percentage  of their business in fee-based accounts, because we believe they are
best  positioned  to  improve  their  earnings  regardless  of  the direction of
interest rates.


Can you give us an update on recent activity in the field of socially
responsible investing?


In our last report, we discussed a shareholder resolution facing Home Depot, the
large home improvement retailer. The resolution was intended to stop the sale of
building  products  made  from  old-growth  wood.  We  voted  in  favor  of this
resolution.  Subsequently,  on  August 26, 1999, Home Depot's President and CEO,
Arthur  M.  Blank,  pledged  to  stop selling wood products from environmentally
sensitive  areas  and,  by  the  end  of  the  year 2002, to eliminate wood from
endangered    areas


from  all  of  its  stores.  In  addition, Blank said the company was working to
ensure  that  the  transition is completely transparent to customers and that it
will not appreciably affect pricing or product availability. We are pleased with
Home  Depot' s  actions,  which have apparently started a trend among other home
improvement  retailers.  For  example, HomeBase, the Irvine, CA-based chain, and
Wickes  Lumber  followed  suit  by  announcing  plans  to stop selling wood from
endangered   old  growth  forests.  It  is  expected  that  several  other  home
improvement  retailers  will  follow  the  lead  set  by  these three companies


In  other  industry  news,  on  November 4, 1999, the Social Investment Forum, a
nonprofit  organization  dedicated  to  promoting  socially  and environmentally
responsible  investing,  released  a  report  stating  that  today  more than $2
trillion is invested in the United States in a socially responsible manner. This
reflects  an  82%  rise  from  1997  levels.  However,  what  may  be  even more
significant  is  the  rise  in  socially responsible assets versus the growth of
overall  stock  market  investing. According to the report, socially responsible
assets  grew  at roughly TWICE the rate of all assets in the market in the U.S.,
which climbed 42% during the same time period.(3)


We  are  very  pleased  with  the  findings of the report and believe it clearly
illustrates  that  a  growing number of Americans are investing their money in a
fashion   that   is   aligned  with  their  social  and  environmental  values.

AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE MAXIMUM INITIAL SALES CHARGE IN THE
CASE OF CLASS A AND CLASS T SHARES, OR THE APPLICABLE CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES
CHARGE IMPOSED ON REDEMPTIONS IN THE CASE OF CLASS B AND CLASS C SHARES. HAD
THESE CHARGES BEEN REFLECTED, RETURNS WOULD HAVE BEEN LOWER. ON AUGUST 31, 1999,
THE FUND ADOPTED A MULTICLASS STRUCTURE. EXISTING FUND SHARES WERE DESIGNATED AS
CLASS Z SHARES AND CLASS Z SHARES WERE CLOSED TO NEW INVESTORS. PAST PERFORMANCE
IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. SHARE PRICE AND INVESTMENT RETURN FLUCTUATE
SUCH THAT UPON REDEMPTION FUND SHARES MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR
ORIGINAL COST.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)







NOTE 1--Significant Accounting Policies:



The  Dreyfus  Premier  Third Century Fund, Inc. (the "fund") is registered under
the  Investment  Company  Act  of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified
open-end  management  investment  company. The fund's investment objective is to
provide capital growth. The Dreyfus Corporation ("Dreyfus") serves as the fund's
investment  adviser.  Dreyfus is a direct subsidiary of Mellon Bank, N.A., which
is  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Mellon  Financial  Corporation. NCM Capital
Management  Group,  Inc.  (" NCM" ) serves as the fund's sub-investment adviser.
Premier Mutual Fund Services, Inc. is the distributor of the fund's shares.


On  April 15, 1999, shareholders approved a reorganization, effective August 31,
1999,  in  which  the  fund' s name changed to The Dreyfus Premier Third Century
Fund,  Inc.  Shares of the fund have been redesignated as Class Z shares and the
fund   added  Class  A,  Class  B,  Class  C,  Class  R  and  Class  T  shares.


The  fund  is  authorized to issue 650 million of $.001 par value Capital Stock.
The  fund  currently  offers  six classes of shares: Class A (100 million shares
authorized) , Class  B  (100  million  shares  authorized), Class C (100 million
shares  authorized) , Class  R  (100  million  shares  authorized), Class T (100
million shares authorized) and Class Z (150 million shares authorized). Class A,
Class  B,  Class  C,  Class  T  and  Class Z shares are sold primarily to retail
investors  through  financial  intermediaries and bear a distribution fee and/or
service  fee.  Class Z shares are not available for new accounts. Class A shares
and  Class  T  shares  are  subject  to  a  sales  charge imposed at the time of
purchase.  Class  B  shares  are  subject  to a contingent deferred sales charge
("CDSC") imposed on Class B share redemptions made within six years of purchase,
Class  C  shares are subject to a CDSC imposed on Class C shares redeemed within
one  year  of  purchase and Class R shares are sold at net asset value per share
only  to  institutional investors. Other differences between the classes include
the  services offered to and the expenses borne by each class and certain voting
rights.



The Fund




NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (CONTINUED)



The  fund' s  financial  statements  are  prepared  in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles which may require the use of management estimates
and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


(a)  Portfolio valuation: Investments in securities are valued at the last sales
price  on  the securities exchange on which such securities are primarily traded
or  at  the  last  sales price on the national securities market. Securities not
listed on an exchange or the national securities market, or securities for which
there were no transactions, are valued at the average of the most recent bid and
asked prices. Bid price is used when no asked price is available. Securities for
which  there  are  no  such valuations are valued at fair value as determined in
good faith under the direction of the Board of Directors.


(b)  Securities  transactions and investment income: Securities transactions are
recorded  on  a  trade  date  basis.  Realized  gain  and  loss  from securities
transactions  are  recorded  on  the  identified  cost basis. Dividend income is
recognized  on  the  ex-dividend  date  and  interest  income,  including, where
applicable,  amortization  of  discount  on  investments,  is  recognized on the
accrual  basis.  Under the terms of the custody agreement, the fund received net
earnings credits during the period ended November 30, 1999.


(c)  Dividends  to shareholders: Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Dividends  from  investment  income-net  and dividends from net realized capital
gain   are   normally  declared  and  paid  annually,  but  the  fund  may  make
distributions  on  a  more  frequent  basis  to  comply  with  the  distribution
requirements  of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). To
the  extent  that  net  realized  capital  gain  can  be  offset by capital loss
carryovers, if any, it is the policy of the fund not to distribute such gain.


(d) Federal income taxes: It is the policy of the fund to continue to qualify as
a  regulated  investment company, if such qualification is in the best interests
of  its  shareholders,  by complying with the applicable provisions of the Code,
and  to  make  distributions  of  taxable  income  sufficient to relieve it from
substantially all Federal income and excise taxes.



NOTE 2--Bank Line of Credit:



The  fund  participates  with  other  Dreyfus-managed  funds  in  a $500 million
redemption  credit  facility  (the  "Facility" ) primarily  to  be  utilized for
temporary  or  emergency  purposes,  including  the financing of redemptions. In
connection therewith, the fund has agreed to pay commitment fees on its pro rata
portion  of  the  Facility.  Interest  is  charged to the fund at rates based on
prevailing market rate in effect at the time of borrowings.


The  average  daily  amount  of  borrowings  outstanding during the period ended
November  30,  1999,  was approximately $350,300 with a related weighted average
annualized interest rate of 5.49%.



NOTE 3--Investment Advisory Fee, Sub-Investment Advisory Fee and Other
Transactions With Affiliates:



(a)  Pursuant  to  the investment advisory agreement ("Agreement") with Dreyfus,
the  investment  advisory  fee is computed at an annual rate of .75 of 1% of the
value of the fund's average daily net assets and is payable monthly. Pursuant to
an  undertaking  if  in any full fiscal year the aggregate expenses allocable to
Class  Z, exclusive of taxes, brokerage, interest on borrowings, commitment fees
and  extraordinary  expenses,  exceed  11_2% of the average value of Class Z net
assets, the fund may deduct from the fees paid to Dreyfus, or Dreyfus will bear,
such  excess expense. There was no expense reimbursement during the period ended
November 30, 1999.


Pursuant  to  a  Sub-Investment  Advisory Agreement with NCM, the sub-investment
advisory  fees  are  payable monthly by Dreyfus, and are based upon the value of
the fund's average daily net assets, computed at the following rates:

Notes & Disclosures
 For share classes offered after the fund's inception date, the total returns quoted reflect the performance of the fund's initial share class(es), adjusted to reflect applicable non-recurring sales charges. Performance for these share classes has not been adjusted to reflect any class-specific distribution or servicing fees or any differences in operating expenses. Had such fees and expenses been reflected, returns for these share class returns during such periods would have been lower. Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.Source: Morningstar, Inc.
