Maureen O’Connell
Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Maureen O’Connell is Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Scholastic Corporation (NASDAQ: SCHL). In this role, O’Connell directs all administrative functions, including Finance, Global Operations, Scholastic Technology Services, Human Resources, and Strategic Planning and Business Development. She reports to Scholastic Chairman, President and CEO, Richard Robinson.
O’Connell joined Scholastic in January, 2007 bringing her strong background in finance and operations primarily in the publishing and direct marketing businesses to the global children’s publishing, education and media company. Since joining the Company, O’Connell has been a key partner with all business units to better align support functions while enhancing visibility to operating trends and leading business indicators. She improved company-wide budgeting, forecasting and capital allocation processes and led the development of pricing strategy across the business units. She also centralized all supply chain, purchasing and manufacturing activities across the company, improved the Scholastic distribution centers’ turn times and reduced inventory. O’Connell has been instrumental in strategically retiring some legacy systems while investing in new technologies that can best serve the Company’s transition to the increasingly important digital publishing, marketing and distribution of children’s books and educational materials.
From 2000 to 2002, O’Connell served as CFO of Barnes & Noble before joining Gartner Inc., a leading technology research and advisory firm, where as CFO/CAO, she was responsible for global administrative and financial functions and later as President and COO she oversaw all business performance, including sales, marketing and operations. Just prior to joining Scholastic, O’Connell was CFO of Affinion Group, Inc., a direct marketing firm.
O’Connell began her career in public accounting and moved to publishing as Director of Accounting at Primedia. She soon became the head of finance with operating responsibilities at Newfield Publications, a subsidiary which included the Weekly Reader continuity business and later became CFO of subsidiary Newbridge Communications, which ran professional book clubs, including teacher clubs and supplemental educational publishing. After eight years, she moved to Bertelsmann Music Group in the direct marketing area. She later became CFO of Publishers Clearing House.
Maureen O’Connell holds a B.S. in Accounting and Economics from New York University.
