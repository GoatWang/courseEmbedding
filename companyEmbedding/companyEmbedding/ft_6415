Customer Questions & Answers








            does this building come with a floor? Can the building be set on a stone/gravel foundation?

            Are you able to lock this building? If so, how do you recommend doing so?
        


Asked by: Anonymous

            The left door locks with top and bottom bolts that slide up into the frame and down into the floor. The right door has a metal tab that meets a metal tab on the left door when both are closed. Place a padlock shank through holes in the two taps to secure the right door.

            Does it need to be anchored to a slab?
        


Asked by: Terry

            I have two of these sheds, from 2009 and 2015. The need to anchor this shed is probably variable, depending on what you put in it. Because the wall sections are anchored to the plastic floor, the weight of all you have inside the shed serves to hold it secure in t he wind. I have a stack of lumber, lawn tractor, log splitter in mine, so it has never left the ground. However, last year I added &quot;screw in&quot; type anchors outside the shed and connected them with cable through the plastic wall to the metal frame, just to be sure. My shed is set on a sand base, so I do not know what you might want to do to anchor it to a concrete base. Maybe drill though the floor into the concrete using something like Tapcon masonry screws . I'm sure you won't need me to figure out how to do it if you think it is necessary.

        Way better value than Tuff Shed
I have two neighbors with this exact shed and I am absolutely in love with it!  I'm currently saving up to buy my own.  They are designed well and they really hold up.  We had a funnel cloud rip through our neighborhood not long ago and neither of them budged. These are a fraction of the cost of a Tuff Shed, and they are just as good if not better. You don't have maintenance on them like most of the other major shed brands. Very impressed!

        Best customer service ever!
I bought my shed many years ago. My skylights were starting to rot out from the sun (as expected). I contacted Lifetime via email, I was immediately contacted back and asked for a parts breakdown. I recieved it, and listed the parts I was looking for. I immediately recieved a response, and my parts are on the way. Every company should model themselves after Lifetime when it comes to customer service. Very sharp!

I did a lot of reading before deciding to purchase this shed online. I ended up getting it on sale for $1605 shipped from Wayfair (used 10% coupon when the price dropped to $1783 - no tax). I wanted a Vinyl shed that would not need to be built on skids because I didn't want to have to re-shingle or re-paint it in the future and I didn't want any animals living under the shed. As you can see from the pictures I ended up using pea gravel inside a box made from railroad ties. I leveled the pea gravel the best that I could using a laser level and spinning it around little by little to check the height from the middle.

On to the shed... I spent about 90 minutes reading the manual before the shed arrived. I ended up downloading an older version of the shed instructions that I found helpful to use with the updated instructions that came in the box. A couple of the diagrams from the older directions were useful although most of the pictures from the new (updated) directions were better to use. There were a few times that were confusing about which way the parts were supposed to go - an example would be the door frame pieces could use a better explanation on the orientation in the picture. One of my door frames was "punched" an inch too high from the factory but lifetime sent me a new piece via express delivery from Fedex. Lifetime tech support was great each of the 3 times that I called. It's not that I was having trouble but I wanted to make sure I could put the windows and skylights on the same side and not affect the integrity of the structure. I'm in the northern hemisphere and the doors face 120 degrees southeast so the sun is only on one side of the shed and I wanted to maximize the light.

I spent about 10 hours putting the trusses together along with the door hardware and lock mechanism and skylights. I did as much as I could by myself - the floor was challenging by myself but if I used concrete I think it would have been easier. Once the floor was level and down, and the doors and trusses were pre-assembled by me in advance it took 4 people 6 hours from start to finish including stopping for breakfast and lunch. It was myself and my friend and we had a couple of tall neighborhood kids there to help hold the walls while we screwed the screws as well as get up on the ladders to help hold the roof panels in place as we screwed from the inside. I don't care how many reviews you read on here  or Amazon/Lowes website, there is no way that someone put this together completely by themselves unless they're god. One piece of advice that I read on Amazon and was helpful would be to put the roof caps on immediately after you put both sides of the roof on while there is an opening next to it so you can reach easier.

If I was able to make improvements to the shed I would think about the clips that hold the windows in place - they are terrible. I called Lifetime and they sent me replacements to try since the ones I have don't "spin" freely at all. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a shed that seems like it will last. My father laughed at me when I told him I was buying this - he said my shed was going to be built out of the same material that my 4 year old's play house was made from but he retracted his statement at the end; he was impressed with the final product. I didn't screw it down because it is heavy enough not to go anywhere.

Also a few reviews talked about ABT delivering the shed. I had a very positive experience with them and scheduled the day/time I needed and the driver had the proper pallet jack to bring the pallet down my driveway and place it in my garage.

        Excellent Product
Very pleased with the shed. Very spacious. Comes in four very large boxes, and the directions are in BOX 4 - we printed the entire 100 page assembly manual because I was afraid to start unpacking stuff without the parts list. Finally found the directions in the last box. More importantly - when they say "must be built on a level surface" - they mean it! We anchored ours to a 4" deep concrete slab we had poured just for this purpose, and it turned out our concrete guy had allowed it the slab to slope about 1" over the 14' length. You wouldn't think that would make much difference, but it was enough to make assembling it a real pain, as the wall panels didn't line up correctly. We managed, but had we not had to fight the sloping slab, we would've had the entire thing assembled much faster. As it was, it took my husband and me (mostly my husband, I admit) about 3 hours to assemble the floor and the walls, and my husband and his dad and sister finished the trusses and the roof in about another 4 hours. It will seem very flimsy right up until you get the roof put on, but once it's done, it's quite strong. Windows and skylights let in plenty of light. Just so you know, the windows do crank open for ventilation, but there are no screens. Definitely cheaper than a wooden shed of comparable size, and much stronger than a metal one - branches, baseballs, and everything else just bounce right off it. Highly recommend it!

        The Perfect Shed
I've been looking for a shed for long time. Metal was instantly out of the picture, due to potential rust issues and maintenance upkeep. If I was going to have or make a shed, I was going to do it right. The decision came down to a plastic/vinyl shed or a wood shed. A plastic or vinyl shed would likely be slightly more expensive, but it would stand up against the elements and be constructed relatively easily. With a wood shed, I could either buy a kit, or get or make a plan and come up with the parts myself.

Wood shed kits often come with cheap wood that you will want to upgrade anyways (i.e. warped wood or 1x2s where a 2x4 would work better). After that you would still have to complete the roof, floor and paint. If you pulled the materials together yourself, it would take some time, but it would be done right.

After much deliberation, I decided to go with this vinyl shed due to is durability and ease of assembly. I picked this one from Lifetime in particular because after looking at a bunch of sheds, they seemed to be the most durable and they had a 10 year warranty. I also needed it to be completed fast and this was the best option.

From all the reviews, I have read, this one had the best. After opening the 4 large boxes (about 250lbs each), I could tell I made the right decision. The walls are thicker and heavier than most other sheds I had seen. I was able to finish the assembly in about 8 hours with 1 other person. A few parts were missing or the wrong size, but one call to Lifetime and that was settled.

The roof was the hardest part to get on, but it was definitely worth the trouble. After a few rainstorms, there were no leaks inside the shed. The windows open and close well into their set notches. I keep them open slightly for venting purposes, but this shed already comes with a few built in vents so that's great. The skylights allow the right amount of light in during the day and also have not leaked. The doors are a little tough to adjust perfectly, but once you do, you'll have perfect assembly.

In the end, I am very happy with my choice in this shed. I may have spent a little more money now, but will end up saving in the future. I have a family and work full time, so this was definitely the most economical and efficient use of my time. I can still construct shelves inside the shed for the custom aspect of wood, but won't have to worry about any maintenance or the cost that goes with it. Obviously everyone will have their own opinion, but for me, this was the perfect shed.

More info 

This attractive Lifetime 6415 shed is a backyard attraction that has as much style as your house! You’ll appreciate the windows, skylights, and spacious headroom of this design. Lifetime’s 6415 shed comes with plenty of room for the big stuff and a shelving system and peg strips for the small stuff so you can find what you need, when you need it. Lifetime 6415 sheds are designed for style and durability. Constructed from high-density polyethylene (HDPE)plastic with sturdy steel reinforcements, our sheds are weather resistant to rusting, fading and cracking and never need painting! For routine cleaning, simply spray down with a hose. Made in the USA. Compatible with our 11 ft expansion kits.
Consult local building codes before assembly.This shed must be built on a flat level foundation of wood or concrete (not included). Flooring must be anchored to the foundation. Anchoring hardware depends on the type of foundation you have and is therefore not included in the shed kit. Not including the installation of the foundation, you can expect assembly of the shed itself to take 2 adults up to 8 hours.
