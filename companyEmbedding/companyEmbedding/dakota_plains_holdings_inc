Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

Were You Sold Stock in Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc by NICHOLAS HARRIS SHERMETA or Another Broker? 


Did your broker recommend investing in Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc and you suffered financial losses?  Were you a client of NICHOLAS HARRIS SHERMETA (CRD#: 2414010), formerly with NORTHLAND SECURITIES, INC. in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who was barred by the SEC from acting as a broker or investment adviser or otherwise associating with firms that sell securities or provide investment advice to the public and was charged with 5 counts of wirefraud?
There was a 13 count indictment issued in March of 2017 by the US Attorney, charging RYAN RANDALL GILBERTSON, 41, founder of Dakota Plains, Inc., DOUGLAS VAUGHN HOSKINS, 48, and NICHOLAS HARRIS SHERMETA, 49, with wire fraud stemming from a complex stock manipulation scheme resulting in the company owing more than $30 million in fraudulent bonus payments.
Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. is an integrated midstream energy company operating the Pioneer Terminal with services that include outbound crude oil storage, logistics, and rail transportation and inbound frac sand logistics. According to the indictment, in December 2008, GILBERTSON and his business partner founded Dakota Plains, Inc., a privately held Minnesota corporation that owned and operated a transloading facility in New Town, North Dakota, for loading crude oil onto trains for transport to oil refineries.
In 2012, GILBERTSON arranged for Dakota Plains to become a publicly traded company by entering into a “reverse merger” agreement with MCT Holding Corporation, an alleged public shell company that owned a single defunct tanning salon in Salt Lake City. Allegedly, at GILBERTSON’s direction, HOSKINS, who was a polo player and manager for GILBERTSON ‘s polo team, purchased 50,000 freely trading shares of MCT stock and opened a trading account with a broker in Salt Lake City, which would allow him to sell the MCT stock. HOSKINS, who had no prior investing experience or assets and a significant amount of debt, received $30,000 from GILBERTSON to purchase the stock. On March 23, 2012, following the merger of Dakota Plains with MCT, Dakota Plains Holdings became a publicly traded company. According to the indictment, on the first day of public trading, HOSKINS offered to sell his newly acquired shares for an inflated price of approximately $12 per share at GILBERTSON’S direction, and continued throughout the first 20 days of trading. During this same time, SHERMETA, who allegedly had a series of bogus consulting agreements with GILBERTSON, began purchasing shares of Dakota Plains stock on behalf of both himself and his clients at inflated prices without their knowledge.
Throughout the 20-day period following the reverse merger, GILBERTSON, along with the help of SHERMETA and HOSKINS, manipulated the price of Dakota Plains stock to increase the average trading price to $11.30 per share which triggered a bonus payment of approximately $32 million to GILBERTSON and the other noteholders. GILBERTSON, who controlled 40 percent of the Notes, was entitled to more than $12 million in bonus payments.
The company’s stock went from a low of 30 cents to $12 a share in the first few weeks of trading.  After receiving bonus payments, the manipulation allegedly ended and the stock tumbled, falling to pennies and eventually was delisted.
NICHOLAS HARRIS SHERMETA, according to FINRA’s BrokerCheck, had been in the securities industry for 22 years and was listed with 7 firms, the last two listed below:
11/25/2011 – 11/09/2016  NORTHLAND SECURITIES, INC. – MINNEAPOLIS, MN
06/06/2002 – 11/28/2011  FELTL & COMPANY – MINNEAPOLIS, MN
If you were a victim of this alleged fraud and unknowingly purchased inflated shares of Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. from NICHOLAS HARRIS SHERMETA or another broker and suffered investment losses, call Soreide Law Group for a no-cost consultation regarding the possible recovery of your financial losses at:  888-760-6552.
Soreide Law Group operates on a contingency fee basis and we represent our clients nationwide before FINRA.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. – Operations





























|||







Operations



Pioneer Terminal



 


 



In 2009, Dakota Plains completed its initial acquisition and build out of its New Town, North Dakota transloading facility.  The transloading facility is connected to the Canadian Pacific Railway.  In 2011 we doubled the size of our facility and brought the on-site tank car capacity to 160.  We continued adding land, taking our terminal to approximately 200 acres today.  In 2013, the terminal had nearly $70M in CAPEX projects, building state of the art crude oil and frac sand operations.  Dakota Plains manages all aspects of the operations at the Pioneer Terminal.


Crude Oil Operations






 



Dakota Plains crude oil operations are based around two 8,500 foot loop tracks each capable of 120 car unit trains, 180,000 barrels of crude oil storage, a high speed loading facility that can accommodate 10 rail cars simultaneously, two active gathering system pipelines and transfer stations to receive crude oil from 10 trucks simultaneously.  We implemented leading edge fire suppression, spill remediation and backup power generation solutions.  Our terminal has also deployed industry leading automated terminal metering and accounting systems.  We have commenced construction on the third 90,000 barrel storage tank, which should be operational in the Summer of 2015, enabling the terminal maintain its nameplate capacity of 80,000 barrels per day.


Frac Sand Operations






 



Dakota Plains executed an agreement with UNIMIN Corporation to construct a 750,000 ton per year frac sand automated terminal in Q3 2013.  UNIMIN is one of the world’s leading producer of quartz proppants, and this terminal connects its largest frac sand mine, Tunnel City, Wisconsin.  UNIMIN funded the project building 8,000 tons of sand storage, four new ladder tracks with the capacity to land 70 loaded railcars and one track dedicated to empty cars.  Frac sand operations commenced in Q1 2014.


Industrial Zone








The Pioneer Terminal has over 70 acres of industrial-zoned space within the double loop track and would be ideal for a laydown yard or bulk storage.   Access is via a secured entry/exit point and the land has been brought to grade.  The land is raw, ideal for building to suit.  The space is available for long-term leasing, and ideal for shippers wanting access to rail.  The Pioneer Terminal’s four ladder tracks, representing 10,000 feet of useable capacity, had previously been used for crude oil.  With the Pioneer Terminal expansion (double loop track) now complete, Dakota Plains is ready to utilize of these ladder tracks and build out the industrial yard.

About


  

Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. is an integrated midstream energy company operating the Pioneer Terminal with services that include outbound crude oil storage, logistics, and rail transportation and inbound frac sand logistics. The Pioneer Terminal is located in Mountrail County, North Dakota, where it is uniquely positioned to exploit opportunities in the heart of the Bakken and Three Forks plays of the Williston Basin.  The Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana is the largest onshore oil production source in North America where the lack of available pipeline capacity provides a long-term and increasing surplus of crude oil available for the core business of the company.  Its frac sand business provides services for UNIMIN Corporation – one of the world’s leading producers of quartz proppant and largest supplier of frac sand to E&P operating companies in the Williston Basin.  Dakota Plains was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Wayzata, Minnesota.

I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
