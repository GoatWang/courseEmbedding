WNC  Housing  Tax  Credit  Fund  IV,  L.P.,  Series 1 (the  "Partnership")  is a
California Limited  Partnership formed under the laws of the State of California
on May 4,  1993.  The  Partnership  was formed to  acquire  limited  partnership
interests or membership  interests in limited  partnerships or limited liability
companies  ("Local  Limited   Partnerships")   which  own  multi-family  housing
complexes  that are  eligible  for Federal  low-income  housing  and, in certain
cases, California low-income housing tax credits ("Low Income Housing Credits").

The general partner of the Partnership is WNC Tax Credit Partners IV, L.P. ("TCP
IV"). The general  partner of TCP IV is WNC & Associates,  Inc.  ("Associates").
The  chairman  and  president  of  Associates  owns  substantially  all  of  the
outstanding  stock of Associates.  The business of the  Partnership is conducted
primarily  through  Associates  as  neither  TCP IV  nor  the  Partnership  have
employees of their own.                                                         

Pursuant to a  registration  statement  filed with the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission,  on October 20, 1993, the Partnership commenced a public offering of
10,000 Units of Limited Partnership Interest ("Units"), at a price of $1,000 per
Unit. The Partnership's  offering terminated on July 19, 1994. A total of 10,000
Limited Partnership Interests representing $10,000,000 had been sold. Holders of
Limited Partnership Interests are referred to herein as "Limited Partners."     

The Partnership shall continue to be in full force and effect until December 31,
2050 unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the partnership  agreement
or law.                                                                         

Description of Business                                                         

The  Partnership's  principal  business  objective  is to  provide  its  Limited
Partners with Low Income Housing Credits.  The Partnership's  principal business
therefore  consists of investing as a limited partner or non-managing  member in
Local  Limited  Partnerships  each of which  owns and  operates  a  multi-family
housing  complex  (the  "Housing  Complexes")  which  qualify for the Low Income
Housing Credits.  In general,  under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, an
owner of low-income housing can receive the Low Income Housing Credit to be used
to reduce  Federal  taxes  otherwise due in each year of a ten-year  period.  In
general,  under Section 17058 of the  California  Revenue and Taxation  Code, an
owner of low-income housing can receive the California Low Income Housing Credit
to be used against  California  taxes  otherwise due in each year of a four-year
period. Each Housing Complex is subject to a fifteen-year compliance period (the
"Compliance  Period"),  and  under  state law may have to be  maintained  as low
income housing for 30 or more years.                                            

In general,  in order to avoid  recapture  of Low Income  Housing  Credits,  the
Partnership  does not  expect  that it will  dispose of its  interests  in Local
Limited Partnerships ("Local Limited Partnership Interests") or approve the sale
by any Local Limited  Partnership of its Housing Complex prior to the end of the
applicable  Compliance  Period.  Because  of  (i)  the  nature  of  the  Housing
Complexes,  (ii) the  difficulty of predicting  the resale market for low-income
housing  15 or more years in the  future,  and (iii) the  ability of  government
lenders to  disapprove  of transfer,  it is not possible at this time to predict
whether the liquidation of the  Partnership's  assets and the disposition of the
proceeds,  if any, in  accordance  with the  Partnership's  Agreement of Limited
Partnership,  dated May 4, 1993, (the "Partnership Agreement"),  will be able to
be accomplished  promptly at the end of the 15-year  period.  If a Local Limited
Partnership is unable to sell its Housing  Complex,  it is anticipated  that the
local general partner ("Local General  Partner") will either continue to operate
such Housing  Complex or take such other  actions as the Local  General  Partner
believes  to  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Local  Limited  Partnership.
Notwithstanding the preceding,  circumstances  beyond the control of the General
Partner or the Local General  Partners may occur during the  Compliance  Period,
which would  require the  Partnership  to approve the  disposition  of a Housing
Complex prior to the end thereof,  possibly resulting in recapture of Low Income
Housing Credits.

As of March 31, 2004, the Partnership  had invested in twenty-one  Local Limited
Partnerships.  Each of these Local Limited  Partnerships  owns a Housing Complex
that is eligible  for the  federal  Low Income  Housing  Credit.  Certain  Local
Limited Partnerships may also benefit from government programs promoting low- or
moderate-income housing.                                                        

Certain Risks and Uncertainties                                                 

An investment in the  Partnership  and the  Partnership's  investments  in Local
Limited  Partnerships  and their Housing  Complexes are subject to risks.  These
risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the  Partnership,  and the
amount of proceeds  available for distribution to the Limited Partners,  if any,
on liquidation of the Partnership's investments. Some of those risks include the
following:                                                                      

The Low Income  Housing  Credit rules are extremely  complicated.  Noncompliance
with these rules  results in the loss of future Low Income  Housing  credits and
the  fractional  recapture  of Low Income  Housing  Credits  already  taken.  An
individual  Limited  Partner's  ability to use tax credits is  limited.  In most
cases,  the  annual  amount of Low Income  Housing  Credits  that an  individual
Limited Partner can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person's last
$25,000 of taxable  income.  Low Income Housing Credits may be the only material
benefit from the  Partnership  because  Limited  Partners may not get back their
capital.  Any  transactions  between  the  Partnership  and  Associates  and its
affiliates will entail conflicts of interest.                                   

The Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited  Partnerships.
Such  limited  diversity  means that the  results of  operation  of each  single
Housing  Complex  will have a greater  impact on the  Partnership.  With limited
diversity,   poor   performance   of  one  Housing   Complex  could  impair  the
Partnership's ability to satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex
is subject to mortgage  indebtedness.  If a Local Limited  Partnership failed to
pay its  mortgage,  it  could  lose  its  Housing  Complex  in  foreclosure.  If
foreclosure  were to occur during the first 15 years,  the loss of any remaining
future Low Income  Housing  Credits,  and a  fractional  recapture  of prior Low
Income Housing Credits,  would occur. At any time, a foreclosure would result in
a loss of the Partnership's  investment in the Housing Complex.  The Partnership
is a limited partner or non-managing  member of each Local Limited  Partnership.
Accordingly,  the  Partnership  will have very  limited  rights with  respect to
management of the Local Limited Partnerships.  The Partnership will rely totally
on the Local General Partners.  Neither the  Partnership's  investments in Local
Limited Partnerships, nor the Local Limited Partnerships' investments in Housing
Complexes,  are readily marketable.  To the extent the Housing Complexes receive
government financing or operating subsidies,  they may be subject to one or more
of the  following  risks:  difficulties  in  obtaining  tenants  for the Housing
Complexes;  difficulties  in  obtaining  rent  increases;  limitations  on  cash
distributions;  limitations  on  sales  or  refinancing  of  Housing  Complexes;
limitations on transfers of interests in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations
on removal of Local  General  Partners;  limitations  on subsidy  programs;  and
possible changes in applicable regulations. Uninsured casualties could result in
loss of property  and Low Income  Housing  Credits and  recapture  of Low Income
Housing Credits  previously  taken. The value of real estate is subject to risks
from fluctuating  economic conditions,  including  employment rates,  inflation,
tax, environmental,  land use and zoning policies,  supply and demand of similar
properties, and neighborhood conditions, among others.                          

The  ability of Limited  Partners to claim tax losses  from the  Partnership  is
limited.  The IRS may audit the  Partnership or a Local Limited  Partnership and
challenge  the tax  treatment  of tax items.  The  amount of Low Income  Housing
Credits and tax losses allocable to the Limited Partners could be reduced if the
IRS were  successful  in such a  challenge.  The  alternative  minimum tax could
reduce tax benefits from an investment in the  Partnership.  Changes in tax laws
could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership  and/or
the value of the Housing Complexes.                                             

There are limits on the transferability of units, including a prohibition on the
transfer of more than 50% of the Units in a 12-month  period.  No trading market
for the Units exists or is expected to develop.  Limited  Partners may be unable
to sell their Units except at a discount and should consider their Units to be a
long-term investment.  Individual Limited Partners will have no recourse if they
disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the majority of Limited Partners. 

Substantially  all of the Low Income Housing Credits  anticipated to be realized
from the Local Limited Partnerships have been realized. The Partnership does not
anticipate  being  allocated a significant  amount of Low Income Housing Credits
from the Local  Limited  Partnerships  in the  future.  Until the Local  Limited
Partnerships  have completed the 15 year Low Income  Housing  Credit  compliance
period risks exist for potential recapture of prior low Income Housing Credits.

Anticipated  future and  existing  cash  resources  are not  sufficient  to meet
existing   contractual  cash  obligations.   Substantially  all  of  the  future
contractual  cash  obligations  of the  Partnership  are  payable to the General
Partner.  Though a substantial portion of the amounts contractually obligated to
the  General  Partner  are  contractually  currently  payable,  the  Partnership
anticipates  that the  General  Partner  will not  require  the payment of these
contractual  obligations  until  capital  reserves  are in excess of the  future
foreseeable  working  capital  requirements  of the  Partnership.  However,  the
Partnership is  contractually  required to pay these  obligations to the General
Partner on a current basis. The Partnership  would be adversely  affected should
the General Partner demand current payment of these contractual  obligations and
or suspend services for this or any other reason.                               

Exit Strategy                                                                   

The IRS  compliance  period for  low-income  housing  tax credit  properties  is
generally  15  years  following   construction  or  rehabilitation   completion.
Associates was one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated  investments
in Low Income  Housing  Credits.  The  initial  programs  are  completing  their
compliance periods.                                                             

With that in mind, the Partnership is continuing its review of the Partnership's
holdings,  with special emphasis on the more mature  properties  including those
that have satisfied the IRS compliance  requirements.  The review considers many
factors  including  extended use requirements on the property (such as those due
to mortgage restrictions or state compliance  agreements),  the condition of the
property,  and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners from the sale of the
property.                                                                       

Upon identifying  those  properties with the highest  potential for a successful
sale,  refinancing  or  syndication,  the  Partnership  expects to proceed  with
efforts to liquidate those properties.  The objective is to maximize the Limited
Partners' return wherever possible and, ultimately, to wind down the Partnership
when it no longer  provides tax  benefits to Limited  Partners.  However,  Local
Limited  Partnership  interests may be disposed at any time by Associates in its
discretion.  To date no  properties  in the  Partnership  have been selected for
disposition.                                                                    

Item 2.  Properties                                                             

Through its investments in Local Limited  Partnerships,  the  Partnership  holds
indirect  ownership  interests in the Housing  Complexes.  The  following  table
reflects the status of the twenty-one Housing Complexes as the dates and for the
periods indicated:

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations                                                   

Forward Looking Statements                                                      

With  the  exception  of  the  discussion  regarding   historical   information,
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations"  and other  discussions  elsewhere in this Form 10-K contain forward
looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations subject to
uncertainties  and other  factors which may involve known and unknown risks that
could  cause  actual  results  of  operations  to differ  materially  from those
projected or implied. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon
assumptions about future events which may not prove to be accurate.             

Risks and uncertainties  inherent in forward looking statements include, but are
not  limited  to,  our  future  cash  flows and  ability  to  obtain  sufficient
financing, level of operating expenses, conditions in the low income housing tax
credit property market and the economy in general, as well as legal proceedings.
Historical  results are not necessarily  indicative of the operating results for
any future period.                                                              

Subsequent  written and oral forward  looking  statements  attributable to us or
persons  acting on our behalf  are  expressly  qualified  in their  entirety  by
cautionary  statements  in this Form 10-K and in other reports we filed with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission.  The following discussion should be read in
conjunction  with  the  Financial  Statements  and the  Notes  thereto  included
elsewhere in this filing.                                                       

Critical Accounting Policies and Certain Risks and Uncertainties                

The Company believes that the following  discussion  addresses the Partnership's
most  significant  accounting  policies,  which are the most  critical to aid in
fully understanding and evaluating the Company's reported financial results, and
certain of the Partnership's risks and uncertainties.                           

Use of Estimates                                                                

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting  period.  Actual results could materially differ from those
estimates.

Method of Accounting For Investments in Limited Partnerships                    

The Partnership  accounts for its investments in limited  partnerships using the
equity method of  accounting,  whereby the  Partnership  adjusts its  investment
balance for its share of the Local Limited  Partnerships'  results of operations
and for any  contributions  made and  distributions  received.  The  Partnership
reviews the  carrying  amount of an  individual  investment  in a Local  Limited
Partnership for possible  impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying  amount of such  investment  may not be  recoverable.
Recoverability  of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by
management,  generally  consisting  of  the  product  of  the  remaining  future
Low-Income  Housing Credits estimated to be allocable to the Partnership and the
estimated  residual value to the Partnership.  If an investment is considered to
be impaired, the Partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any
such Local Limited  Partnership.  The  accounting  policies of the Local Limited
Partnerships,  generally,  are  expected  to be  consistent  with  those  of the
Partnership.  Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring the investments are
capitalized  as part of the investment  account and are being  amortized over 30
years (Notes 2 and 3).                                                          

Equity in losses of limited  partnerships for each year ended March 31 have been
recorded by the Partnership based on nine months of reported results provided by
the Local  Limited  Partnerships  for each year ended  December  31 and on three
months of results  estimated  by  management  of the  Partnership.  Management's
estimate for the three-month  period is based on either actual unaudited results
reported  by  the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  or  historical  trends  in  the
operations  of the Local Limited  Partnerships.  Equity in losses from the Local
Limited  Partnerships  allocated to the  Partnership  are not  recognized to the
extent that the investment  balance would be adjusted below zero. As soon as the
investment balance reaches zero,  amortization of the related costs of acquiring
the investment are accelerated to the extent of losses available.               

Distributions  received from the Local Limited Partnerships are accounted for as
a  reduction  of  the  investment  balance.  Distributions  received  after  the
investment  has reached  zero are  recognized  as income.  If the Local  Limited
Partnerships  report net income in future  years,  the  Partnership  will resume
applying  the equity  method only after its share of such net income  equals the
share of net losses not  recognized  during the  period(s) the equity method was
suspended.                                                                      

Income Taxes                                                                    

No provision for income taxes has been  recorded in the financial  statements as
any  liability  and/or  benefits  for income  taxes flows to the partners of the
Partnership and is their obligation and/or benefit.  For income tax purposes the
Partnership reports on a calendar year basis.                                   

Certain Risks and Uncertainties                                                 

An investment in the  Partnership  and the  Partnership's  investments  in Local
Limited  Partnerships  and their Housing  Complexes are subject to risks.  These
risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the  Partnership,  and the
amount of proceeds  available for distribution to the Limited Partners,  if any,
on liquidation of the Partnership's investments. Some of those risks include the
following:                                                                      

The Low Income  Housing  Credit rules are extremely  complicated.  Noncompliance
with these rules results in the loss of future Low Income  Housing  Credit s and
the fractional  recapture of Low Income Housing  Credits  already taken. In most
cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Credits that an individual can use
is limited to the tax  liability  due on the  person's  last  $25,000 of taxable
income.  The  Local  Limited  Partnerships  may be  unable  to sell the  Housing
Complexes  at a price  which  would  result in the  Partnership  realizing  cash
distributions or proceeds from the transaction. Accordingly, the Partnership may
be unable to distribute  any cash to its Limited  Partners.  Low Income  Housing
Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the Partnership.          

The Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited  Partnerships.
Such  limited  diversity  means that the  results of  operation  of each  single
Housing Complex will have a greater impact on the Partnership. With limited     

13    

P-->10-K14th Page of 56TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 14th
diversity,   poor   performance   of  one  Housing   Complex  could  impair  the
Partnership's ability to satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex
is subject to mortgage  indebtedness.  If a Local Limited  Partnership failed to
pay its  mortgage,  it  could  lose  its  Housing  Complex  in  foreclosure.  If
foreclosure  were to occur during the first 15 years,  the loss of any remaining
future Low Income Housing  Credits,  a fractional  recapture of prior Low Income
Housing  Credits,  and a loss of the  Partnership's  investment  in the  Housing
Complex would occur. The Partnership is a limited partner or non-managing member
of each Local Limited Partnership.  Accordingly,  the Partnership will have very
limited rights with respect to management of the Local Limited Partnerships. The
Partnership  will  rely  totally  on the Local  General  Partners.  Neither  the
Partnership's  investments in Local Limited Partnerships,  nor the Local Limited
Partnerships'  investments in Housing Complexes, are readily marketable.  To the
extent  the  Housing  Complexes  receive   government   financing  or  operating
subsidies,  they  may be  subject  to  one  or  more  of  the  following  risks:
difficulties  in obtaining  tenants for the Housing  Complexes;  difficulties in
obtaining  rent  increases;  limitations on cash  distributions;  limitations on
sales or refinancing of Housing Complexes; limitations on transfers of interests
in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations on removal of Local General Partners;
limitations on subsidy programs; and possible changes in applicable regulations.
Uninsured  casualties  could result in loss of property  and Low Income  Housing
Credits and recapture of Low Income Housing Credits  previously taken. The value
of real  estate  is  subject  to risks  from  fluctuating  economic  conditions,
including employment rates, inflation,  tax, environmental,  land use and zoning
policies, supply and demand of similar properties,  and neighborhood conditions,
among others.                                                                   

The  ability of Limited  Partners to claim tax losses  from the  Partnership  is
limited.  The IRS may audit the  Partnership or a Local Limited  Partnership and
challenge  the tax  treatment  of tax items.  The  amount of Low Income  Housing
Credits and tax losses allocable to the Limited Partners could be reduced if the
IRS were  successful  in such a  challenge.  The  alternative  minimum tax could
reduce tax benefits from an investment in the  Partnership.  Changes in tax laws
could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership  and/or
the value of the Housing Complexes.                                             

Substantially  all of the Low Income Housing Credits  anticipated to be realized
from the Local Limited Partnerships have been realized. The Partnership does not
anticipate  being  allocated a significant  amount of Low Income Housing Credits
from the Local  Limited  Partnerships  in the  future.  Until the Local  Limited
Partnerships  have completed the 15 year Low Income  Housing  Credit  compliance
period risks exist for potential recapture of prior low Income Housing Credits. 

No trading  market  for the Units  exists or is  expected  to  develop.  Limited
Partners  may be unable to sell  their  Units  except at a  discount  and should
consider their Units to be a long-term  investment.  Individual Limited Partners
will have no recourse if they disagree with actions  authorized by a vote of the
majority of Limited Partners.                                                   

To date, certain Local Limited Partnerships have incurred significant  operating
losses and have working capital  deficiencies.  In the event these Local Limited
Partnerships continue to incur significant operating losses,  additional capital
contributions  by the  Partnership  and/or  the  Local  General  Partner  may be
required  to sustain  the  operations  of such Local  Limited  Partnerships.  If
additional  capital  contributions  are not made  when  they are  required,  the
Partnership's  investment in certain of such Local Limited Partnerships could be
impaired, and the loss and recapture of the related tax credits could occur.    

Anticipated  future and  existing  cash  resources  are not  sufficient  to meet
existing   contractual  cash  obligations.   Substantially  all  of  the  future
contractual  cash  obligations  of the  Partnership  are  payable to the General
Partner.  Though a substantial portion of the amounts contractually obligated to
the  General  Partner  are  contractually  currently  payable,  the  Partnership
anticipates  that the  General  Partner  will not  require  the payment of these
contractual  obligations  until  capital  reserves  are in excess of the  future
foreseeable  working  capital  requirements  of the  Partnership.  However,  the
Partnership is  contractually  required to pay these  obligations to the General
Partner  and/or its  affiliates on a current  basis.  The  Partnership  would be
adversely  affected should the General Partner and/or  affiliates demand current
payment of these contractual obligations and or suspend services for this or any
other reason.

Financial Condition                                                             

The  Partnership's  assets at March 31, 2004 consisted  primarily of $222,000 in
cash  and  aggregate  investments  in  the  21  Local  Limited  Partnerships  of
$1,396,000.  Liabilities at March 31, 2004 were $161,000,  of which $159,000 was
accrued  annual  management  fees and advances due to the General  Partner,  and
$2,000 was a payable to a limited partnership.                                  

Results of Operations                                                           

Year  Ended  March  31,  2004   Compared  to  Year  Ended  March  31,  2003  The
Partnership's  net  loss for the  year  ended  March  31,  2004 was  $(597,000),
reflecting an increase of $(276,000) from the net loss  experienced for the year
ended March 31,  2003.  The increase in net loss is due to equity in losses from
limited  partnerships  which  increased by $(161,000) to $(400,000) for the year
ended March 31, 2004 from  $(239,000) for the year ended March 31, 2003.  Equity
in losses  of  limited  partnerships  increased  from the  prior  year due to an
increase of the  write-off  of  acquisition  fees and costs in the current  year
related to the investments that have gone below zero. Additionally, there was an
increase in loss from operations of approximately  $(116,000)  largely due to an
impairment  loss of $(124,000) for the year ended March 31, 2004. The impairment
loss was due to a  certain  limited  partnership  whose net  investment  balance
exceeded the remaining tax credits and residual  value.  The impairment loss was
offset by a decrease in  amortization  of  acquisition  fees and costs of $6,000
along with an increase in income of $3,000 in the current year.                 

Year  Ended  March  31,  2003   Compared  to  Year  Ended  March  31,  2002  The
Partnership's  net  loss for the  year  ended  March  31,  2003 was  $(321,000),
reflecting  a decrease of $323,000  from the net loss  experienced  for the year
ended  March 31,  2002.  The decline in net loss is  primarily  due to equity in
losses from limited  partnerships  which  declined by $326,000 to $(239,000) for
the year ended March 31, 2003 from $(565,000) for the year ended March 31, 2002.
Equity in losses of  limited  partnerships  decreased  from  prior year due to a
reduction  of the  write-off of  acquisition  fees and costs in the current year
related  to the  investments  that have gone  below  zero.  The equity in losses
decrease  is  also  due to  one of the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  having  an
extraordinary gain of $86,000 in the current year.                              

Liquidity and Capital Resources                                                 

Year Ended  March 31,  2004  Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2003 Net cash used
during the year ended March 31, 2004 was $(16,000) compared to net cash used for
the year ended March 31, 2003 of  $(39,000).  The change was  primarily due to a
$21,000  increase of cash  provided by investing  activities  due to the $21,000
increase in distributions received from limited partnerships.                   

Year Ended March 31, 2003  Compared to Year Ended March 31, 2002.  Net cash used
during the year ended March 31, 2003 was $(39,000) compared to net cash used for
the year ended March 31, 2002 of  $(35,000).  The change was  primarily due to a
$9,000  increase of cash used for  operating  expenses of which $4,000  resulted
from a decrease  in  interest  income,  offset by an  increase of $5,000 of cash
provided by investing  activities  resulting  from a decrease of  investments in
limited  partnerships of $16,000 from prior year offset by a decrease of $11,000
in distributions from limited partners.                                         

The financial statements of one Local Limited Partnership were prepared assuming
the limited  partnership will continue as a going concern.  The auditor for this
entity has expressed  substantial  doubt as to this entity's ability to continue
as a going concern as a result of the property tax issue  discussed  below.  The
Partnership  had a $0 and $183,195,  remaining  investment in such Local Limited
Partnership at March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Partnership's original
investment in the Local Limited  Partnership  approximated  $1,691,585.  Through
December 31, 2003,  the Local  Limited  Partnership  has had  recurring  losses,
working capital  deficiencies  and has not been billed for certain  property tax
expenses due since 1994. The Local Limited  Partnership is seeking  abatement or
an extended payment plan to pay down certain of these liabilities;  however,  if
the  Local  Limited  Partnership  is  unsuccessful,  additional  funding  may be
requested from the  Partnership.  In the event the Local Limited  Partnership is
required  to  liquidate  or  sell  its  property,  the  net  proceeds  could  be
significantly less than the carrying value of such property. As of              

15

P-->10-K16th Page of 56TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 16th
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of such property on the books and
records of the Local Limited  Partnership  totaled  $6,114,888  and  $6,311,179,
respectively.                                                                   

The Partnership  expects its future cash flows,  together with its net available
assets at March 31, 2004, to be  sufficient  to meet all  currently  foreseeable
future cash  requirements.  This  excludes  amounts  owed to  Associates  by the
Partnership disclosed below.

(1)  Asset  Management  Fees  are  payable  annually  until  termination  of the
Partnership,  which is to occur no later than  2050.  The  estimate  of the fees
payable included herein assumes the retention of the  Partnership's  interest in
all Housing Complexes until 2050. Amounts due to the General Partner as of March
31, 2004 have been  included in the 2005  column.  The General  Partner does not
anticipate that these fees will be paid until such time as capital  reserves are
in  excess  of  the  future  foreseeable  working  capital  requirements  of the
Partnership.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements                                                  

The Partnership has no off-balance sheet arrangements.                          

Exit Strategy                                                                   

The IRS  compliance  period for  low-income  housing  tax credit  properties  is
generally  15 years from  occupancy  following  construction  or  rehabilitation
completion.  WNC was one of the first in the industry to offer investments using
the tax credit.  Now these very first programs are completing  their  compliance
period.                                                                         

With that in mind, we are continuing our review of the  Partnership's  holdings,
with special  emphasis on the more mature  properties  including those that have
satisfied the IRS compliance requirements. Our review will consider many factors
including  extended  use  requirements  on the  property  (such as those  due to
mortgage  restrictions  or state  compliance  agreements),  the condition of the
property,  and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners from the sale of the
property.                                                                       

Upon identifying  those  properties with the highest  potential for a successful
sale, refinancing or syndication, we expect to proceed with efforts to liquidate
those  properties.  Our  objective is to maximize the Limited  Partners'  return
wherever  possible  and,  ultimately,  to wind down  those  funds that no longer
provide  tax  benefits  to  Limited  Partners.  To  date  no  properties  in the
Partnership have been selected.                                                 

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements                                         

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN46"), "Consolidation
of  Variable  Interest  Entities."  FIN 46  provides  guidance on when a company
should include the assets,  liabilities,  and activities of a variable  interest
entity  ("VIE")  in  its  financial  statements  and  when  it  should  disclose
information  about its relationship  with a VIE. A VIE is a legal structure used
to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if
it is the primary  beneficiary  because it absorbs the  majority of the entity's
expected losses, the majority of the expected returns, or both.

In  December  2003,  the FASB issued a revision of FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") to clarify
some of its provisions.  The revision results in multiple  effective dates based
on the  nature  as well as the  creation  date of the VIE.  VIEs  created  after
January 31,  2003,  but prior to January 1, 2004,  may be  accounted  for either
based on the original interpretations or the revised  interpretations.  However,
all VIEs must be accounted for under the revised interpretations as of March 31,
2004, when FIN 46R is effective for the Partnership.                            

This  Interpretation  would require  consolidation by the Partnership of certain
Local Limited  Partnerships' assets and liabilities and results of operations if
the Partnership determined that the Local Limited Partnership was a VIE and that
the  Partnership  was  the  "Primary  Beneficiary."  Minority  interests  may be
recorded for the Local Limited  Partnerships'  ownership  share  attributable to
other Limited Partners. Where consolidation of Local Limited Partnerships is not
required,   additional  financial  information   disclosures  of  Local  Limited
Partnerships  may be  required.  The  Partnership  has  assessed  the  potential
consolidation effects of the Interpretation and preliminarily concluded that the
adoption of the Interpretation  will not have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Partnership.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Partners                                                                 
WNC Housing Tax Credit Fund IV, L.P., Series 1                                  

     We have  audited the  accompanying  balance  sheet of WNC Housing Tax redit
Fund IV, L.P., Series 1 (a California Limited  Partnership) (the  "Partnership")
as of March 31, 2004 and the related statements of operations,  partners' equity
and cash  flows for the year then  ended.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our  audit.  A  significant
portion of the  financial  statements of the limited  partnerships  in which the
Partnership  is a limited  partner were audited by other  auditors whose reports
have been  furnished to us. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial  statements,
the Partnership  accounts for its investments in limited  partnerships using the
equity  method.   The  portion  of  the  Partnership's   investment  in  limited
partnerships  audited  by other  auditors  represented  $1,212,000  of the total
assets of the  Partnership  at March 31, 2004 and $259,000 of the  Partnership's
net loss for the year ended March 31, 2004.  Our opinion,  insofar as it relates
to the amounts included in the financial statements for the limited partnerships
which  were  audited  by  others,  is based  solely on the  reports of the other
auditors.                                                                       

     We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit and the reports of the other auditors  provide a reasonable  basis for our
opinion.                                                                        

     In our opinion,  based on our audit and the reports of the other  auditors,
the  financial  statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all material
respects, the financial position of WNC Housing Tax Credit Fund IV, L.P., Series
1 (a California  Limited  Partnership)  as of March 31, 2004, and the results of
its  operations  and its cash flows for the year then ended in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

WNC Housing Tax Credit Fund IV, L.P., Series 1                                  

We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheet of WNC Housing Tax Credit Fund
IV, L.P., Series 1 (a California Limited  Partnership) (the "Partnership") as of
March 31,  2003 and the  related  statements  of  operations,  partners'  equity
(deficit)  and cash flows for the years  ended  March 31,  2003 and 2002.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  A significant  portion of the  financial  statements of the limited
partnerships in which the Partnership is a limited partner were audited by other
auditors  whose reports have been furnished to us. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial  statements,  the Partnership  accounts for its investments in limited
partnerships   using  the  equity  method.  The  portion  of  the  Partnership's
investment in limited  partnerships audited by other auditors represented 74% of
the total  assets of the  Partnership  at March 31, 2002 and 79%, and 79% of the
Partnership's equity in losses of limited partnerships for the years ended March
31,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Our  opinion,  insofar  as it relates to the
amounts included in the financial  statements for the limited partnerships which
were audited by others, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.   

We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  standards  of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a

the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                  

In our opinion,  based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors,  the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial  position of WNC Housing  Tax Credit Fund IV,  L.P.,  Series 1 (a
California  Limited  Partnership)  as of March 31, 2003,  and the results of its
operations  and its cash flows for the years ended  March 31, 2003 and 2002,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 For The Years Ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES            
--------------------------------------------------------------------            

Organization                                                                    
------------                                                                    

WNC Housing Tax Credit Fund IV, L.P., Series 1, a California Limited Partnership
(the  "Partnership"),  was  formed on May 4, 1993 under the laws of the state of
California,  and commenced  operations on October 20, 1993. The  Partnership was
formed to invest  primarily in other limited  partnerships  (the "Local  Limited
Partnerships")  which  own  and  operate  multi-family  housing  complexes  (the
"Housing Complexes") that are eligible for low income housing credits. The local
general   partners  (the  "Local  General   Partners")  of  each  Local  Limited
Partnership retain  responsibility  for maintaining,  operating and managing the
Housing Complex.                                                                

The  general  partner  is WNC  Tax  Credit  Partners,  IV,  L.P.  (the  "General
Partner"),   a  California   limited   partnership.   WNC  &  Associates,   Inc.
("Associates")  is the general partner of the General Partner.  The chairman and
president  of  Associates  own  substantially  all of the  outstanding  stock of
Associates.  The  business of the  Partnership  is conducted  primarily  through
Associates, as the Partnership has no employees of its own.                     

The Partnership shall continue to be in full force and effect until December 31,
2050 unless terminated prior to that date pursuant to the partnership  agreement
or law.                                                                         

The financial  statements  include only activity relating to the business of the
Partnership,  and do not give  effect to any assets that the  partners  may have
outside of their interests in the Partnership, or to any obligations,  including
income taxes, of the partners.                                                  

The  Partnership  Agreement  authorized the sale of up to 10,000 units at $1,000
per Unit  ("Units").  The offering of Units concluded in July 1994 at which time
10,000 Units in the amount of $10,000,000 had been accepted. The General Partner
has a 1% interest in operating  profits and losses,  taxable  income and losses,
cash  available  for  distribution  from the  Partnership  and tax credits.  The
limited  partners  will  be  allocated  the  remaining  99% of  these  items  in
proportion to their respective investments.                                     

After the limited partners have received proceeds from sale or refinancing equal
to their capital contributions and their return on investment (as defined in the
Partnership  Agreement) and the General  Partner has received  proceeds equal to
its capital contribution and subordinated  disposition fee (as described in Note
3) from the  remainder,  any  additional  sale or  refinancing  proceeds will be
distributed  90% to the limited  partners  (in  proportion  to their  respective
investments) and 10% to the General Partner.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

 For The Years Ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Risks and Uncertainties                                                         
-----------------------                                                         

An investment in the  Partnership  and the  Partnership's  investments  in Local
Limited  Partnerships  and their Housing  Complexes are subject to risks.  These
risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the  Partnership,  and the
amount of proceeds  available for distribution to the Limited Partners,  if any,
on liquidation of the Partnership's investments. Some of those risks include the
following:                                                                      

The Low Income  Housing  Credit rules are extremely  complicated.  Noncompliance
with these rules results in the loss of future Low Income  Housing  Credit s and
the fractional  recapture of Low Income Housing  Credits  already taken. In most
cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Credits that an individual can use
is limited to the tax  liability  due on the  person's  last  $25,000 of taxable
income.  The  Local  Limited  Partnerships  may be  unable  to sell the  Housing
Complexes  at a price  which  would  result in the  Partnership  realizing  cash
distributions or proceeds from the transaction. Accordingly, the Partnership may
be unable to distribute  any cash to its Limited  Partners.  Low Income  Housing
Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the Partnership.          

The Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited  Partnerships.
Such  limited  diversity  means that the  results of  operation  of each  single
Housing  Complex  will have a greater  impact on the  Partnership.  With limited
diversity,   poor   performance   of  one  Housing   Complex  could  impair  the
Partnership's ability to satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex
is subject to mortgage  indebtedness.  If a Local Limited  Partnership failed to
pay its  mortgage,  it  could  lose  its  Housing  Complex  in  foreclosure.  If
foreclosure  were to occur during the first 15 years,  the loss of any remaining
future Low Income Housing  Credits,  a fractional  recapture of prior Low Income
Housing  Credits,  and a loss of the  Partnership's  investment  in the  Housing
Complex would occur. The Partnership is a limited partner or non-managing member
of each Local Limited Partnership.  Accordingly,  the Partnership will have very
limited rights with respect to management of the Local Limited Partnerships. The
Partnership  will  rely  totally  on the Local  General  Partners.  Neither  the
Partnership's  investments in Local Limited Partnerships,  nor the Local Limited
Partnerships'  investments in Housing Complexes, are readily marketable.  To the
extent  the  Housing  Complexes  receive   government   financing  or  operating
subsidies,  they  may be  subject  to  one  or  more  of  the  following  risks:
difficulties  in obtaining  tenants for the Housing  Complexes;  difficulties in
obtaining  rent  increases;  limitations on cash  distributions;  limitations on
sales or refinancing of Housing Complexes; limitations on transfers of interests
in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations on removal of Local General Partners;
limitations on subsidy programs; and possible changes in applicable regulations.
Uninsured  casualties  could result in loss of property  and Low Income  Housing
Credits and recapture of Low Income Housing Credits  previously taken. The value
of real  estate  is  subject  to risks  from  fluctuating  economic  conditions,
including employment rates, inflation,  tax, environmental,  land use and zoning
policies, supply and demand of similar properties,  and neighborhood conditions,
among others.                                                                   

The  ability of Limited  Partners to claim tax losses  from the  Partnership  is
limited.  The IRS may audit the  Partnership or a Local Limited  Partnership and
challenge  the tax  treatment  of tax items.  The  amount of Low Income  Housing
Credits and tax losses allocable to the Limited Partners could be reduced if the
IRS were  successful  in such a  challenge.  The  alternative  minimum tax could
reduce tax benefits from an investment in the  Partnership.  Changes in tax laws
could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership  and/or
the value of the Housing Complexes.                                             

Substantially  all of the Low Income Housing Credits  anticipated to be realized
from the Local Limited Partnerships have been realized. The Partnership does not
anticipate  being  allocated a significant  amount of Low Income Housing Credits
from the Local  Limited  Partnerships  in the  future.  Until the Local  Limited
Partnerships  have completed the 15 year Low Income  Housing  Credit  compliance
period risks exist for potential recapture of prior low Income Housing Credits.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

 For The Years Ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

No trading  market  for the Units  exists or is  expected  to  develop.  Limited
Partners  may be unable to sell  their  Units  except at a  discount  and should
consider their Units to be a long-term  investment.  Individual Limited Partners
will have no recourse if they disagree with actions  authorized by a vote of the
majority of Limited Partners.                                                   

Anticipated  future and  existing  cash  resources  of the  Partnership  are not
sufficient to meet existing  contractual cash obligations.  Substantially all of
the future  contractual  cash  obligations of the Partnership are payable to the
General  Partner.  Though a  substantial  portion of the  amounts  contractually
obligated  to the  General  Partner are  contractually  currently  payable,  the
Partnership anticipates that the General Partner will not require the payment of
these contractual obligations until capital reserves are in excess of the future
foreseeable  working  capital  requirements  of the  Partnership.  However,  the
Partnership is  contractually  required to pay these  obligations to the General
Partner on a current basis. The Partnership  would be adversely  affected should
the General Partner demand current payment of these contractual  obligations and
or suspend services for this or any other reason.                               

Exit Strategy                                                                   
-------------                                                                   

The IRS  compliance  period for  low-income  housing  tax credit  properties  is
generally  15 years from  occupancy  following  construction  or  rehabilitation
completion.  WNC was one of the first in the industry to offer investments using
the tax credit.  Now these very first programs are completing  their  compliance
period.                                                                         

With that in mind,  the  Partnership  is continuing to review the  Partnership's
holdings,  with special emphasis on the more mature  properties  including those
that have satisfied the IRS compliance  requirements.  The Partnership's  review
will consider many factors  including  extended use requirements on the property
(such as those due to mortgage restrictions or state compliance agreements), the
condition of the property, and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners from
the sale of the property.                                                       

Upon identifying  those  properties with the highest  potential for a successful
sale,  refinancing  or  syndication,  the  Partnership  expects to proceed  with
efforts  to  liquidate  those  properties.  The  Partnership's  objective  is to
maximize the Limited Partners' return wherever possible and, ultimately, to wind

Method of Accounting for Investments in Limited Partnerships                    
------------------------------------------------------------                    

The Partnership  accounts for its investments in limited  partnerships using the
equity method of  accounting,  whereby the  Partnership  adjusts its  investment
balance for its share of the Local Limited  Partnerships'  results of operations
and for any  contributions  made and  distributions  received.  The  Partnership
reviews the  carrying  amount of an  individual  investment  in a Local  Limited
Partnership for possible  impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying  amount of such  investment  may not be  recoverable.
Recoverability  of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by
management,  generally  consisting  of  the  product  of  the  remaining  future
Low-Income  Housing Credits estimated to be allocable to the Partnership and the
estimated  residual value to the Partnership.  If an investment is considered to
be impaired, the Partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any
such Local Limited  Partnership.  The  accounting  policies of the Local Limited
Partnerships,  generally,  are  expected  to be  consistent  with  those  of the
Partnership.  Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring the investments are
capitalized  as part of the investment  account and are being  amortized over 30
years (see Note 2).                                                             

Equity in losses of limited  partnerships for each year ended March 31 have been
recorded by the Partnership based on nine months of reported results provided by
the Local  Limited  Partnerships  for each year ended  December  31 and on three
months of results  estimated  by  management  of the  Partnership.  Management's
estimate for the three-month

period is based on either actual unaudited results reported by the Local Limited
Partnerships  or  historical  trends  in the  operations  of the  Local  Limited
Partnerships.  Equity in losses from the Local Limited Partnerships allocated to
the  Partnership  are not recognized to the extent that the  investment  balance
would be adjusted  below zero. As soon as the investment  balance  reaches zero,
amortization of the related costs of acquiring the investment are accelerated to
the extent of losses  available (see Note 3). If the Local Limited  Partnerships
report net income in future  years,  the  Partnership  will resume  applying the
equity  method  only after its share of such net income  equals the share of net
losses not recognized during the period(s) the equity method was suspended.     

Use of Estimates                                                                
----------------                                                                

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting  period.  Actual results could materially differ from those
estimates.                                                                      

Cash and Cash Equivalents                                                       
-------------------------                                                       

The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less when purchased to be cash  equivalents.  As of March 31,
2004 and 2003, the Partnership had no cash equivalents.                         

Concentration of Credit Risk                                                    
----------------------------                                                    

At March 31,  2004,  the  Partnership  maintained  a cash  balance  at a certain
financial institution in excess of the maximum federally insured amounts.       

Net Loss Per Limited Partner Unit                                               
---------------------------------                                               

Net loss per  limited  partner  unit is  calculated  pursuant  to  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 128,  Earnings Per Share. Net loss per unit
includes no dilution  and is computed  by  dividing  loss  available  to limited
partners by the weighted average number of units outstanding  during the period.
Calculation of diluted net loss per unit is not required.                       

Income Taxes                                                                    
------------                                                                    

No provision  for income taxes has been recorded in the  accompanying  financial
statements  as any  liability  and/or  benefits for income taxes as income taxes
flows to the partners of the Partnership and is their obligation and/or benefit.
For income tax purposes the Partnership reports on a calendar year basis.       

New Accounting Pronouncements                                                   
-----------------------------                                                   

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN46"), "Consolidation
of  Variable  Interest  Entities."  FIN 46  provides  guidance on when a company
should include the assets,  liabilities,  and activities of a variable  interest
entity  ("VIE")  in  its  financial  statements  and  when  it  should  disclose
information  about its relationship  with a VIE. A VIE is a legal structure used
to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if
it is the primary  beneficiary  because it absorbs the  majority of the entity's
expected losses, the majority of the expected returns, or both.                 

In  December  2003,  the FASB issued a revision of FIN 46 ("FIN 46R") to clarify
some of its provisions.  The revision results in multiple  effective dates based
on the nature as well as the creation date of the VIE. VIEs created

after  January 31,  2003,  but prior to January 1, 2004,  may be  accounted  for
either based on the  original  interpretations  or the revised  interpretations.
However, all VIEs must be accounted for under the revised  interpretations as of
March 31, 2004, when FIN 46R is effective for the Partnership.                  

This  Interpretation  would require  consolidation by the Partnership of certain
Local Limited  Partnerships' assets and liabilities and results of operations if
the Partnership determined that the Local Limited Partnership was a VIE and that
the  Partnership  was  the  "Primary  Beneficiary."  Minority  interests  may be
recorded for the Local Limited  Partnerships'  ownership  share  attributable to
other Limited Partners. Where consolidation of Local Limited Partnerships is not
required,   additional  financial  information   disclosures  of  Local  Limited
Partnerships  may be  required.  The  Partnership  has  assessed  the  potential
consolidation effects of the Interpretation and preliminarily concluded that the
adoption of the Interpretation  will not have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Partnership.                                                  

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS                                    
--------------------------------------------                                    

As of the periods  presented,  the Partnership had acquired limited  partnership
interests  in  twenty-one  Local  Limited  Partnerships,  each of which owns one
Housing  Complex  consisting  of  an  aggregate  of  812  apartment  units.  The
respective Local General Partners of the Local Limited  Partnerships  manage the
day-to-day  operations of the entities.  Significant  Local Limited  Partnership
business decisions require approval from the Partnership.  The Partnership, as a
limited partner, is generally entitled to 99%, as specified in the Local Limited
Partnership agreements,  of the operating profits and losses, taxable income and
losses and tax credits of the Local Limited Partnerships.                       

As discussed in Note 1, the Partnership  accounts for its investments in limited
partnerships   using  the  equity  method  of  accounting.   The   Partnership's
investments  in Local  Limited  Partnerships  as shown in the balance  sheets at
March  31,  2004  and  2003,  are   approximately   $1,403,000  and  $1,207,000,
respectively, greater than the Partnership's equity at the preceding December 31
as  shown in the  Local  Limited  Partnerships'  combined  financial  statements
presented  below.  This  difference is primarily due to  unrecorded  losses,  as
discussed  below,  acquisition,   selection  and  other  costs  related  to  the
acquisition of the investments  which have been capitalized in the Partnership's
investment account,  impairment losses recorded in the Partnership's  investment
account and to capital  contributions  payable to the limited partnerships which
were netted against partner capital in the Local Limited Partnership's financial
statements.  The  Partnership's  investment is also lower than the Partnership's
equity as shown in the Local Limited Partnership's combined financial statements
due to the  estimated  losses  recorded by the  Partnership  for the three month
period ended March 31.                                                          

Equity  in  losses  of the  Local  Limited  Partnerships  is  recognized  in the
financial  statements until the related  investment account is reduced to a zero
balance. Losses incurred after the investment account is reduced to zero are not
recognized. If the Local Limited Partnerships report net income in future years,
the  Partnership  will resume applying the equity method only after its share of
such net  income  equals  the share of net  losses  not  recognized  during  the
period(s) the equity method was suspended.                                      

A loss in value from a Local Limited  Partnership other than a temporary decline
would be recorded as an impairment loss. Impairment is measured by comparing the
investment  carrying  amount to the sum of the total amount of the remaining tax
credits  allocated  to  the  fund  and  the  estimated  residual  value  of  the
investment.   Accordingly,  the  Partnership  recorded  an  impairment  loss  of
$124,048,  $0 and $0 during  the years  ended  March  31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,
respectively.                                                                   

Distributions  from the Local Limited  Partners are accounted for as a reduction
of the  investment  balance.  Distributions  received  after the  investment has
reached zero are recognized as income.

At March 31, 2004 and 2003,  the  investment  accounts in certain  Local Limited
Partnerships  have  reached  a zero  balance.  Consequently,  a  portion  of the
Partnership's  estimate  of its share of losses  for the years  ended  March 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 amounting to approximately $354,000,  $332,000 and $212,000,
respectively,  have not been  recognized.  As of March 31, 2004,  the  aggregate
share of net losses not recognized by the Partnership amounted to $1,250,000.   

Following is a summary of the equity method activity of the investments in Local
Limited Partnerships for the periods presented:

Certain Local Limited Partnerships incurred operating losses and/or have working
capital deficiencies.  In the event these Local Limited Partnerships continue to
incur significant  operating  losses,  additional  capital  contributions by the
Partnership  and/or the Local  General  Partner  may be  required to sustain the
operations  of  such  Local   Limited   Partnerships.   If  additional   capital
contributions are not made when they are required, the Partnership's  investment
in certain of such Local Limited Partnerships could be impaired, and the loss of
future and recapture of prior Low Income Housing Credits could occur.           

The financial statements of one Local Limited Partnership were prepared assuming
the limited  partnership will continue as a going concern.  The auditor for this
entity has expressed  substantial  doubt as to this entity's ability to continue
as a going concern as a result of the property tax issue  discussed  below.  The
Partnership  had a $0 and $183,195,  remaining  investment in such Local Limited
Partnership at March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Partnership's original
investment in the Local Limited  Partnership  approximated  $1,691,585.  Through
December 31, 2003,  the Local  Limited  Partnership  has had  recurring  losses,
working capital  deficiencies  and has not been billed for certain  property tax
expenses due since 1994. The Local Limited  Partnership is seeking  abatement or
an extended payment plan to pay down certain of these liabilities;  however,  if
the  Local  Limited  Partnership  is  unsuccessful,  additional  funding  may be
requested from the  Partnership.  In the event the Local Limited  Partnership is
required  to  liquidate  or  sell  its  property,  the  net  proceeds  could  be
significantly less than the carrying value of such property.  As of December 31,
2003 and 2002,  the carrying  value of such property on the books and records of
the Local Limited Partnership totaled $6,114,888 and $6,311,179, respectively.

 For The Years Ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                             
-----------------------------------                                             

Under the terms of the  Partnership  Agreement,  the  Partnership has paid or is
obligated to the General Partner or its affiliates for the following items:     

          Acquisition  fees of up to 8% of the gross  proceeds  from the sale of
          Partnership  units as compensation for services rendered in connection
          with the acquisition of Local Limited Partnerships.  At the end of all
          periods  presented,  the  Partnership  incurred  acquisition  fees  of
          $800,000.  Accumulated  amortization  of these  capitalized  costs was
          $616,251 and $457,719 as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Of
          the  accumulated  amortization  recorded on the balance sheet at March
31, 2004, $ 140,544,  $49,656 and $117,011 of the related  expense was
          reflected as equity in losses of limited partnerships during the years
          ended  March 31,  2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively,  to reduce  the
          respective  net  acquisition  fee  component of  investments  in local
          limited  partnerships  to zero for those  Local  Limited  Partnerships
which would otherwise be below a zero balance.              

          Reimbursement  of costs incurred by the General  Partner in connection
          with  the   acquisition   of   Local   Limited   Partnerships.   These
          reimbursements  have not exceeded 1.2% of the gross  proceeds.  At the
          end of all periods presented, the Partnership had incurred acquisition
          costs of $54,949,  which have been included in  investments in limited
          partnerships.   At  the  end  of  all  years   presented   accumulated
amortization amounted to $54,949.                           

          An annual  asset  management  fee equal to the  greater  amount of (i)
          $2,000 for each apartment  complex,  or (ii) 0.275% of gross proceeds.
          In either case, the fee will be decreased or increased  annually based
          on changes to the Consumer Price Index.  However, in no event will the
          maximum amount exceed 0.2% of the invested assets of the Local Limited
          Partnerships,  including  the  Partnership's  allocable  share  of the
          mortgages, for the life of the Partnership. Management fees of $42,000
          were incurred during the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, of
which $30,000, $30,000 and $24,500 was paid, respectively.  

          The  Partnership  reimbursed the General Partner or its affiliates for
          operating  expenses  incurred on behalf of the Partnership.  Operating
          expense  reimbursements  were  approximately  $ 27,500 during the year
ended March 31, 2004.                                       

          A subordinated  disposition  fee in an amount equal to 1% of the sales
          price of real estate sold.  Payment of this fee is subordinated to the
          limited partners  receiving a preferred return of 16% through December
31, 2003 and 6% thereafter (as defined in the  Partnership  Agreement)
          and is payable only if the General  Partner or its  affiliates  render
          services in the sales  effort.  No such fee was  incurred in the three
year period ended March 31, 2004.                           

          An affiliate of the General Partner provides  management  services for
          one of the  properties in the limited  partnerships.  Management  fees
          were earned by the  affiliate  in the amount of  $35,780,  $33,926 and
$55,040 for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  

The accrued fees and advances due to the General Partner and affiliates  consist
of the following at:

-----------------------------------------                                       

Payables  to limited  partnerships  represent  amounts  which are due at various
times based on conditions specified in the limited partnership agreement.  These
contributions  are  payable  in  installments  and  are  due  upon  the  limited
partnership  achieving certain operating and development  benchmarks  (generally
within two years of the Partnership's initial investment).

Item  9.  Changes  in and  Disagreements  With  Accountants  on  Accounting  and
Financial Disclosure
NOT APPLICABLE                                                                  

Item 9a. Controls and Procedures                                                

As of the end of the period covered by this report,  the  Partnership's  General
Partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial  Officer of Associates  carried out an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Fund's "disclosure  controls and procedures" as defined
in  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934  Rule  13a-15  and  15d-15.  Based on that
evaluation,  the Chief Executive  Officer and Principal  Financial  Officer have
concluded  that  as of  the  end of the  period  covered  by  this  report,  the
Partnership's  disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective in
timely  alerting  them  to  material  information  relating  to the  Partnership
required to be included in the Partnership's periodic SEC filings.              

Changes  in  internal  controls.  There  were no  changes  in the  Partnership's
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
March 31, 2004 that materially affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 11.  Executive Compensation:

terms of the  Partnership  Agreement the  Partnership  is obligated to TCP IV or
Associates during the current or future years for the following fees:           

(a)  Annual Asset  Management Fee. An annual asset  management fee accrues in an
     amount  greater of (i) $2,000 per  multi-family  housing  complex,  or (ii)
     0.275% of Gross  Proceeds.  The base fee amount will be  adjusted  annually
     based on the change in the Consumer Price Index.  However, in no event will
     the annual asset management fee exceed 0.2% of Invested  Assets.  "Invested
     Assets"  means the sum of the  Partnership's  investment  in Local  Limited
     Partnerships  and the  Partnership's  allocable  share of the amount of the
     indebtedness  related  to the  Housing  Complexes.  Fees  of  $42,000  were
     incurred  during  the  years  ended  March  31,  2004,  2003  and  2002 The

(b)  Subordinated  Disposition Fee. A subordinated  disposition fee in an amount
     equal to 1% of the sale price may be received in  connection  with the sale
     or disposition of a Housing Complex.  Subordinated disposition fees will be
     subordinated  to  the  prior  return  of  the  Limited   Partners'  capital
     contributions  and  payment  of the  return on  investment  to the  Limited
     Partners.  "Return  on  Investment"  means an  annual,  cumulative  but not
     compounded,  "return" to the Limited Partners (including Low Income Housing
     Credits) as a class, on their adjusted capital contributions commencing for
     each Limited  Partner on the last day of the calendar  quarter during which
     the Limited Partner's capital  contribution is received by the Partnership,
     calculated at the following  rates:  (i) 16% through December 31, 2003, and
     (ii) 6% for the balance of the Partnership's term. No disposition fees have
been incurred.

	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES









	General








	The accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q for quarterly reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Partnership's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.








	Organization








	WNC Housing Tax Credit Fund IV, L.P., Series 1 (the “Partnership”) is a California Limited Partnership formed under the laws of the State of California on May 4, 1993 and commenced operations on October 20, 1993.  The Partnership was formed to acquire limited partnership interests in other limited partnerships ("Local Limited Partnerships") which own multi-family housing complexes (“Housing Complexes”) that are eligible for Federal low income housing tax credits (“Low Income Housing Tax Credits”).  The local general partners (the “Local General Partners”) of each Local Limited Partnership retain responsibility for maintaining, operating and managing the Housing Complex. Each Local Limited Partnership is governed by its agreement of limited partnership (the “Local Limited Partnership Agreement”).







	The general partner of the Partnership is WNC Tax Credit Partners IV, L.P. (“TCP IV” or the “General Partner”). The General Partner of TCP IV is WNC & Associates, Inc. (“Associates”). The chairman and the president of Associates owns all of the outstanding stock of Associates. The business of the Partnership is conducted primarily through the General Partner, as the Partnership has no employees of its own.







	The Partnership shall continue in full force and effect until December 31, 2050, unless terminated prior to that date, pursuant to the partnership agreement or law.







	The financial statements include only activity relating to the business of the Partnership, and do not give effect to any assets that the partners may have outside of their interests in the Partnership, or to any obligations, including income taxes, of the partners.







	The partnership agreement authorized the sale of up to 10,000 units of limited partnership interest (“Partnership Units”) at $1,000 per Partnership Unit.  The offering of Partnership Units had concluded in July 1994, at which time 10,000 Partnership Units representing subscriptions in the amount of $10,000,000 had been accepted.  The General Partner has a 1% interest in operating profits and losses, taxable income and losses, cash available for distribution from the Partnership and Low Income Housing Tax Credits of the Partnership.  The investors (the “Limited Partners”) in the Partnership will be allocated the remaining 99% of these items in proportion to their respective investments.

	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued








	The proceeds from the disposition of any of the Local Limited Partnership’s Housing Complexes will be used first to pay debts and other obligations per the respective Local Limited Partnership Agreement. Any remaining proceeds will then be paid to the Partnership. The sale of a Housing Complex may be subject to other restrictions and obligations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a Local Limited Partnership will be able to sell its Housing Complex. Even if it does so, there can be no assurance that any significant amounts of cash will be distributed to the Partnership. Should such distributions occur, the Limited Partners will be entitled to receive distributions from the proceeds remaining after payment of Partnership obligations and funding reserves, equal to their capital contributions and their return on investment (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) and the General Partner would then be entitled to receive proceeds equal to its capital contributions from the remainder. Any additional sale or refinancing proceeds will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners (in proportion to their respective investments) and 10% to the General Partner.








	Risks and Uncertainties








	An investment in the Partnership and the Partnership’s investments in Local Limited Partnerships and their Housing Complexes are subject to risks. These risks may impact the tax benefits of an investment in the Partnership, and the amount of proceeds available for distribution to the Limited Partners, if any, on liquidation of the Partnership’s investments. Some of those risks include the following:







	The Low Income Housing Tax Credits rules are extremely complicated. Noncompliance with these rules results in the loss of future Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the fractional recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits already taken. In most cases the annual amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits that an individual can use is limited to the tax liability due on the person’s last $25,000 of taxable income. The Local Limited Partnerships may be unable to sell the Housing Complexes at a price which would result in the Partnership realizing cash distributions or proceeds from the transaction. Accordingly, the Partnership may be unable to distribute any cash to its Limited Partners. Low Income Housing Tax Credits may be the only benefit from an investment in the Partnership.







	The Partnership has invested in a limited number of Local Limited Partnerships. Such limited diversity means that the results of operation of each single Housing Complex will have a greater impact on the Partnership. With limited diversity, poor performance of one Housing Complex could impair the Partnership’s ability to satisfy its investment objectives. Each Housing Complex is subject to mortgage indebtedness. If a Local Limited Partnership failed to pay its mortgage, it could lose its Housing Complex in foreclosure. If foreclosure were to occur during the first 15 years (the “Compliance Period”), the loss of any remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits, a fractional recapture of prior Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and a loss of the Partnership’s investment in the Housing Complex would occur. The Partnership is a limited partner or a non-managing member of each Local Limited Partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership will have very limited rights with respect to management of the Local Limited Partnerships. The Partnership will rely totally on the Local General Partners. Neither the Partnership’s investments in Local Limited Partnerships, nor the Local Limited Partnerships’ investments in Housing Complexes, are readily marketable. To the extent the Housing Complexes receive government financing or operating subsidies, they may be subject to one or more of the following risks: difficulties in obtaining tenants for the Housing Complexes; difficulties in obtaining rent increases; limitations on cash distributions; limitations on sales or refinancing of Housing Complexes; limitations on transfers of interests in Local Limited Partnerships; limitations on removal of Local General Partners; limitations on subsidy programs; and possible changes in applicable regulations. Uninsured casualties could result in loss of property and Low Income Housing Tax Credits and recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits previously taken. The value of real estate is subject to risks from fluctuating economic conditions, including employment rates, inflation, tax, environmental, land use and zoning policies, supply and demand of similar Housing Complexes, and neighborhood conditions, among others.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED







	For the Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2011




	(Unaudited)






	 




	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued








	The ability of Limited Partners to claim tax losses from the Partnership is limited. The IRS may audit the Partnership or a Local Limited Partnership and challenge the tax treatment of tax items. The amount of Low Income Housing Tax Credits and tax losses allocable to Limited Partners could be reduced if the IRS were successful in such a challenge. The alternative minimum tax could reduce tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership. Changes in tax laws could also impact the tax benefits from an investment in the Partnership and/or the value of the Housing Complexes.







	All of the Low Income Housing Tax Credits anticipated to be realized from the Local Limited Partnerships have been realized. The Partnership does not anticipate being allocated any Low Income Housing Tax Credits from the Local Limited Partnerships in the future. Until the Local Limited Partnerships have completed the Compliance Period, risks exist for potential recapture of prior Low Income Housing Tax Credits received.







	No trading market for the Partnership Units exists or is expected to develop. Limited Partners may be unable to sell their Partnership Units except at a discount and should consider their Partnership Units to be a long-term investment. Individual Limited Partners will have no recourse if they disagree with actions authorized by a vote of the majority of Limited Partners.







	The Partnership currently has insufficient working capital to fund its operations. Associates has agreed to continue providing advances sufficient enough to fund the operations and working capital requirements of the Partnership through August 31, 2012.







	Anticipated future and existing cash resources of the Partnership are not sufficient to pay existing liabilities of the Partnership. However, substantially all of the existing liabilities of the Partnership are payable to the General Partner and/or its affiliates. Though the amounts payable to the General Partner and/or its affiliates are contractually currently payable, the Partnership anticipates that the General Partner and/or its affiliates will not require the payment of these contractual obligations until capital reserves are in excess of the aggregate of then existing contractual obligations and then anticipated future foreseeable obligations of the Partnership. The Partnership would be adversely affected should the General Partner and/or its affiliates demand current payment of the existing contractual obligations and or suspend services for this or any other reason.








	Exit Strategy








	The Compliance Period for a Housing Complex is generally 15 years following construction or rehabilitation completion. Associates was one of the first in the industry to offer syndicated investments in Low Income Housing Tax Credits.  The initial programs have completed their Compliance Periods.







	Upon the sale of a Local Limited Partnership interest or Housing Complex after the end of the Compliance Period, there would be no recapture of Low Income Housing Tax Credits.  A sale prior to the end of the Compliance Period could result in recapture if certain conditions are not met.  Twenty of the Housing Complexes have completed their Compliance Period.







	With that in mind, the General Partner is continuing its review of the Housing Complexes. The review considers many factors, including extended use requirements (such as those due to mortgage restrictions or state compliance agreements), the condition of the Housing Complexes, and the tax consequences to the Limited Partners from the sale of the Housing Complexes.

	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued








	Upon identifying those Housing Complexes with the highest potential for a successful sale, refinancing or re-syndication, the Partnership expects to proceed with efforts to liquidate them. The objective is to maximize the Limited Partners’ return wherever possible and, ultimately, to wind down the Partnership as Low Income Housing Tax Credits are no longer available. Local Limited Partnership interests may be disposed of any time by the General Partner in its discretion.  While liquidation of the Housing Complexes continues to be evaluated, the dissolution of the Partnership was not imminent as of June 30, 2011.







	Upon management of the Partnership identifying a Local Limited Partnership for disposition, costs incurred by the Partnership in preparation for the disposition are deferred. Upon the sale of the Local Limited Partnership interest, the Partnership nets the costs that had been deferred against the proceeds from the sale in determining the gain or loss on sale of the Local Limited Partnership. Deferred disposition costs are included in other assets on the balance sheets.







	On March 1, 2011, the Partnership filed preliminary consent solicitation materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding the adoption of a plan of liquidation.  Definitive materials were filed with the SEC on April 1, 2011.  Materials were disseminated to the Limited Partners on April 8, 2011.  The Partnership sought approval to have a formal plan of liquidation of selling its limited partnership interests or selling the underlying Housing Complexes of each of the Local Limited Partnerships. On June 1, 2011 the Partnership received the majority vote in favor of the plan for dissolution.







	The Partnership has received the majority vote in favor of the plan of liquidation of the Partnership.  Therefore, the Partnership is engaging third party appraisers to appraise several or all of the Local Limited Partnerships in this Partnership.  The appraisal is one of the preliminary steps that need to be completed in order to move forward with the approved liquidation plan.  The expense incurred for the appraisals, or any other disposition related expenses the Partnership incurs, are being capitalized and will remain on the balance sheet until the respective Local Limited Partnership is sold.  At the time of disposition the capitalized costs will be netted with any cash proceeds that are received in order to calculate the gain or loss on the disposition.

	Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Partnership sold its Local Limited Partnership Interest in Fawn Haven, L.P. (“Fawn Haven”) to an unrelated third party.  Fawn Haven was appraised with a value of $290,000 and the outstanding mortgage as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $813,000. The Local Limited Partnership Interest was sold for $30,883 which was paid to the Partnership.  The Partnership used the cash proceeds to pay $16,672 in accrued asset management fees and $14,211  to reimburse the General Partner or an affiliate for expense paid on its behalf.  No cash distribution was made to the Limited Partners.  The Partnership incurred appraisal expenses of $2,900 and legal expenses of $114 prior to the sale. The Partnership’s investment balance was zero at the time of the sale, therefore, a gain of $27,869 will be recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2011.  The Compliance Period has expired so there is no risk of tax credit recapture.







	Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Partnership sold its Local Limited Partnership Interest in Indian Creek, L.P. (“Indian Creek”) to an unrelated third party.  Indian Creek was appraised with a value of $600,000 and the outstanding mortgage as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $1,375,000. The Local Limited Partnership Interest was sold for $52,940 which was paid to the Partnership.  The Partnership used the cash proceeds to pay $32,151 in accrued asset management fees and $20,789  to reimburse the General Partner or an affiliate for expense paid on its behalf.  No cash distribution was made to the Limited Partners.  The Partnership incurred appraisal expenses of $2,900 and legal expenses of $114 prior to the sale. The Partnership’s investment balance was zero at the time of the sale, therefore, a gain of $49,926 will be recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2011.  The Compliance Period has expired so there is no risk of tax credit recapture.



	 





	Method of Accounting for Investments in Local Limited Partnerships








	The Partnership accounts for its investments in Local Limited Partnerships using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Partnership adjusts its investment balance for its share of the Local Limited Partnerships’ results of operations and for any contributions made and distributions received. The Partnership reviews the carrying amount of an individual investment in a Local Limited Partnership for possible impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may not be recoverable. Recoverability of such investment is measured by the estimated value derived by management, generally consisting of the sum of the remaining future Low Income Housing Tax Credits estimated to be allocable to the Partnership and the estimated residual value to the Partnership. If an investment is considered to be impaired, the Partnership reduces the carrying value of its investment in any such Local Limited Partnership. The accounting policies of the Local Limited Partnerships, generally, are expected to be consistent with those of the Partnership. Costs incurred by the Partnership in acquiring the investments are capitalized as part of the investment account and were amortized over 30 years (see Note 2).

	For the Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2011




	(Unaudited)






	 




	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued









	“Equity in losses of Local Limited Partnerships” for the periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 has been recorded by the Partnership. Management’s estimate for the three-month period is based on either actual unaudited results reported by the Local Limited Partnerships or historical trends in the operations of the Local Limited Partnerships. In subsequent annual financial statements, upon receiving the actual annual results reported by the Local Limited Partnerships, management reverses its prior estimate and records the actual results reported by the Local Limited Partnerships. Equity in losses of Local Limited Partnerships allocated to the Partnership are not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would be adjusted below zero. If the Local Limited Partnerships report net income in future years, the Partnership will resume applying the equity method only after its share of such net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period(s) the equity method was suspended (see Note 2).



	 




	In accordance with the accounting guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, the Partnership determines when it should include the assets, liabilities, and activities of a variable interest entity (VIE) in its financial statements, and when it should disclose information about its relationship with a VIE. The analysis that must be performed to determine which entity should consolidate a VIE focuses on control and economic factors. A VIE is a legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets, which must be consolidated by a company if it is the primary beneficiary because it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE.







	Based on this guidance, the Local Limited Partnerships in which the Partnership invests meet the definition of a VIE because the owners of the equity at risk in these entities do not have the power to direct their operations. However, management does not consolidate the Partnership's interests in these VIEs, as it is not considered to be the primary beneficiary since it does not have the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the economic performance of these entities. The Partnership currently records the amount of its investment in these Local Limited Partnerships as an asset on its balance sheets, recognizes its share of partnership income or losses in the statements of operations, and discloses how it accounts for material types of these investments in its financial statements. The Partnership's balance in investment in Local Limited Partnerships, plus the risk of recapture of tax credits previously recognized on these investments, represents its maximum exposure to loss. The Partnership's exposure to loss on these Local Limited Partnerships is mitigated by the condition and financial performance of the underlying Housing Complexes as well as the strength of the Local General Partners and their guarantee against credit recapture to the investors in the Partnership.







	Distributions received by the Partnership are accounted for as a reduction of the investment balance. Distributions received after the investment has reached zero are recognized as income. As of all periods presented, all of the investment balances had reached zero.








	Use of Estimates








	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.








	Cash and Cash Equivalents








	The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011, the Partnership had no cash equivalents.

	Reporting Comprehensive Income








	The Partnership had no items of other comprehensive income for all periods presented.



	 





	Income Taxes








	The Partnership has elected to be treated as a pass-through entity for income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to income taxes. Rather, all items of taxable income, deductions and tax credits are passed through to and are reported by its owners on their respective income tax returns. The Partnership’s federal tax status as a pass-through entity is based on its legal status as a partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership is not required to take any tax positions in order to qualify as a pass-through entity. The Partnership is required to file and does file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the Partnership has no other tax positions which must be considered for disclosure.








	Net Loss Per Partnership Unit








	Net loss per Partnership Unit includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss allocated to Limited Partners by the weighted average number of Partnership Units outstanding during the period. Calculation of diluted net loss per Partnership Unit is not required.








	Revenue Recognition








	The Partnership is entitled to receive reporting fees from the Local Limited Partnerships. The intent of the reporting fees is to offset (in part) administrative costs incurred by the Partnership in corresponding with the Local Limited Partnerships. Due to the uncertainty of the collection of these fees, the Partnership recognizes reporting fees as collections are made.








	NOTE 2 - INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS








	As of June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011, the Partnership had acquired limited partnership interests in 21 Local Limited Partnerships, each of which owns one Housing Complex consisting of an aggregate of 812 apartment units. The respective Local General Partners of the Local Limited Partnerships manage the day to day operations of the entities. Significant Local Limited Partnership business decisions require approval from the Partnership. The Partnership, as a Limited Partner, is generally entitled to 99%, as specified in the Local Limited Partnership Agreements, of the operating profits and losses, taxable income and losses, and Low Income Housing Tax Credits of the Local Limited Partnerships.

In the event these Local Limited Partnerships continue to incur significant operating losses, additional capital contributions by the Partnership may be required to sustain operations of such Local Limited Partnerships. If additional capital contributions are not made when they are required, the Partnership's investments in certain of such Local Limited Partnerships could be impaired, and the loss and recapture of the related Low Income Housing Tax Credits could occur.

	NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS








	Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has paid or is obligated to the General Partner or its affiliates the following fees:











	(a)  






	An annual asset management fee equal to the greater amount of (i) $2,000 for each Housing Complex, or (ii) 0.275% of gross proceeds. In either case, the fee will be decreased or increased annually based on changes to the Consumer Price Index. However, in no event will the maximum amount exceed 0.2% of the invested assets of the limited Partnerships, as defined. “Invested Assets” means the sum of the Partnership’s investment in Local Limited Partnership interests and the Partnership’s allocable share of mortgage loans on and other debts related to the Housing Complexes owned by such Local Limited Partnerships. Asset management fees of $10,500 were incurred during each of the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. The Partnership paid the General Partner and or its affiliates $0 and $20,000 of those fees during the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.















	(b)  






	The Partnership reimburses the General Partner or its affiliates for operating expenses incurred by the Partnership and paid for by the General Partner or its affiliates on behalf of the Partnership. Operating expense reimbursements were $35,000 and $6,645 during the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively.















	(c)  






	A subordinated disposition fee in an amount equal to 1% of the sale price may be received in connection with the sale or disposition of a Housing Complex or Local Limited Partnership interest.  Payment of this fee is subordinated to the Limited Partners receiving a preferred return of 16% through December 31, 2004 and 6 % thereafter (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) and is payable only if the General Partner or its affiliates render services in the sales effort.  No such fee was incurred for all periods presented.











	The accrued fees and expenses due to the General Partner and affiliates consist of the following at:












	 




	 





	June 30, 2011





	 





	March 31, 2011

	NOTE 4 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS








	Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Partnership sold its Local Limited Partnership Interest in Fawn Haven, L.P. (“Fawn Haven”) to an unrelated third party.  Fawn Haven was appraised with a value of $290,000 and the outstanding mortgage as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $813,000.

	Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations







	Forward-Looking Statements







	With the exception of the discussion regarding historical information, this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other discussions elsewhere in this Form 10-Q contain forward looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations subject to uncertainties and other factors which may involve known and unknown risks that could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those projected or implied. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions about future events which may not prove to be accurate.







	Risks and uncertainties inherent in forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Partnership’s future cash flows and ability to obtain sufficient financing, level of operating expenses, conditions in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit property market and the economy in general, as well as legal proceedings. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.







	Subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the Partnership or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by cautionary statements in this Form 10-Q and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.







	The following discussion and analysis compares the results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited financial statements and accompanying notes included within this report.







	Financial Condition







	The Partnership’s assets at June 30, 2011 consisted of $43,000 in cash and other assets of $5,000.  Liabilities at June 30, 2011 consisted of $345,000 of accrued fees and expenses due to the General Partner and affiliates and accrued expenses of $16,000.







	Results of Operations








	Three Months Ended June 30, 2011 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2010.

	The Partnership’s net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2011 was $(42,000), reflecting a change of $(43,000) from the $1,000 net income for the three months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $(30,000) increase in legal and accounting fees, which was due to the timing of the accounting work performed.  For the three months ended June 30, 2011, there was also a $(12,000) decrease in reporting fees, which was partially offset by a $3,000 increase in distribution income. Reporting fees and distribution income fluctuate from year to year due to the fact that Local Limited Partnerships pay those fees to the Partnership when the Local Limited Partnerships’ cash flow will allow for the payment.

	Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued





	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources









	Three Months Ended June 30, 2011 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2010.

	The net decrease in cash during the three months ended June 30, 2011 was $(32,000) compared to a $(14,000) decrease in cash for the three months ended June 30, 2010. The change is partially due to the $(35,000) reimbursement of operating advances paid to the General Partner or an affiliate during the three months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $(7,000) reimbursed during the three months  ended  June  30,  2010.   Additionally,  during  the   three  months  ended  June  30,  2011,  the  Partnership  paid  no  accrued  asset

	management fees compared to $(20,000) paid during the three months ended June 30, 2010.  During the three months ended June  30, 2011 the Partnership received $(12,000) less in reporting fees, which was partially offset by an increase of $3,000 received of distribution income.  Both reporting fees and distribution income are paid to the Partnership when the Local Limited Partnerships’ cash flow will allow for the payment.



	 



	During the three months ended June 30, 2011, accrued payables, which consist primarily of related party asset management fees and advances due to the General Partner, decreased by $1,000. The General Partner does not anticipate that these accrued fees and advances will be paid until such time as capital reserves are in excess of foreseeable working capital requirements of the Partnership.







	The Partnership expects its future cash flows, together with its net available assets as of June 30, 2011, to be insufficient to meet all currently foreseeable future cash requirements. Associates has agreed to continue providing advances sufficient enough to fund the operations and working capital requirements of the Partnership through August 31, 2012.







	Recent Accounting Changes







	In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance for Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and shall be applied prospectively except for very limited transactions.  In February 2008, the FASB delayed for one year implementation of the guidance as it pertains to certain non-financial assets and liabilities. The Partnership adopted GAAP for Fair Value Measurements effective April 1, 2008, except as it applies to those non-financial assets and liabilities, for which the effective date was April 1, 2009. The Partnership has determined that adoption of this guidance had no material impact on the Partnership’s financial statements.







	In November 2008, the FASB issued accounting guidance on Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations that addresses how the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined, how an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite-lived intangible asset of an equity method investment should be performed, how an equity method investee’s issuance of shares should be accounted for, and how to account for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method. This guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Partnership adopted the guidance for the interim quarterly period beginning April 1, 2009. The impact of adopting it did not have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial condition or results of operations.







	In April 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance for Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  This requires disclosure about the method and significant assumptions used to establish the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as annual statements.  It became effective for as of and for the interim period ended June 30, 2009 and had no impact on the Partnership’s financial condition or results of operations.







	In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding subsequent events, which was subsequently updated in February 2010. This guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This guidance was effective for financial statements  issued  for  fiscal  years  and  interim  periods  ending  after  June  15,  2009,  and  was  therefore  adopted  by  the

	Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued



	 


	Partnership for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the Partnership reports, either through recognition or disclosure, in the financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, alleviating conflicts with current SEC guidance. This amendment was effective immediately and therefore the Partnership did not include the disclosure in this Form 10-Q.



	 



	In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).  The amended guidance modified the consolidation model to one based on control and economics, and replaced quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis. The primary beneficiary of a VIE will be the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  If multiple unrelated parties share such power, as defined, no party will be required to consolidate the VIE. Further, the amended guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a VIE and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a VIE.  Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced and expanded disclosures around VIEs.  This amendment was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009.  The adoption of this guidance on April 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Partnership’s financial statements.







	In June 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).  Effective July 1, 2009, the Codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.  The Codification is intended to reorganize, rather than change, existing GAAP.  Accordingly, all references to currently existing GAAP have been removed and have been replaced with plain English explanations of the Partnership’s accounting policies.  The adoption of the Codification did not have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial position or results of operations.










	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks







	NOT APPLICABLE










	Item 4. Controls and Procedures







	(a)           

	Disclosure controls and procedures








	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Partnership’s General Partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Associates, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Partnership’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in the Partnership’s periodic report filings with SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, consistent with the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.







	The Partnership must rely on the Local Limited Partnerships to provide the Partnership with certain information necessary to the timely filing of the Partnership’s periodic reports. Factors in the accounting at the Local Limited Partnerships have caused delays in the provision of such information during past reporting periods, and resulted in the Partnership’s inability to file its periodic reports in a timely manner.







	Once the Partnership has received the necessary information from the Local Limited Partnerships, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Associates believe that the material information  required to be disclosed in the Partnership’s periodic report filings with SEC is effectively recorded, processed, summarized and reported, albeit not in a timely manner. Going forward, the Partnership will use the means reasonably within its power to impose procedures designed to obtain from the Local Limited Partnerships the information necessary to the timely filing of the Partnership’s periodic reports.

	Item 4. Controls and Procedures, continued







	(b)           

	Changes in internal controls








	There were no changes in the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting.
