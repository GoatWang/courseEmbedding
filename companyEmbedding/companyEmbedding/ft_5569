Installation Type



X
Floating Floors utilize boards that are glued or snapped together and not attached to the subfloor; this style of flooring is the easiest for a DIY project because most often it requires no glue or nails for installation. One downside to Floating Flooring is that this flooring type doesn't add very much value to your home.Glue Down flooring is glued down to the subfloor and is typical of engineered hardwood flooring.Nail Down flooring requires a nailing process to secure the wood planks in place, this style is used commonly for solid hardwood flooring.Staple Down flooring is very similar to Nail Down in that individual pieces are more easily stabled to the subfloor and are not interlocking.

                    There is a Fall Festival every year, a Haunted House every October that collects food for the local hungry, and my personal favorite, Spring Festival! There is a group called "Lehigh Rocks", that paints and hides rocks for all ages to discover and re-place.  There is an awesome group called "Pay it Forward Lehigh Acres", that seeks those in need and actually, hands on, helps! 

Many of the local businesses have been around for a very long time and most of the residents welcome new business in this (more than) 100K populated (and growing) "Small Town". Our Coldwell Banker office is celebrating 40 years this year! 

Lehigh Acres has some of the BEST (in my opinion) food places.  My local Favorites are NY Pizza, El Rinconcito, and Pelican Snowballs!  Plus, you MUST try the Cheesesteak sandwich at Wayback Burger and the BEST Salsa and breakfast burrito at Taco Ardiente!   

Be sure to get involved with the Relay for Life Event in April or "Make a Difference Day" event in October. 

Lehigh Acres has one of the best parks in Lee County, loaded with all types of fun! 

Stop in and drive around.  Or call me for a private little tour! 239-281-6746

                    The city of Lehigh Acres has just about a little bit of everything. You have some lovely communities, some have Golf Courses. You also have the more Rural areas of Lehigh Acres where you will be surrounded by wooded areas if you chose to stay away from living in the city of Lehigh Acres. Closer to the city you will find some older homes and Condos and shopping areas. This city is continuing to grow and you are also not too far from the Ft. Myers area.

Installation Type



X
Floating Floors utilize boards that are glued or snapped together and not attached to the subfloor; this style of flooring is the easiest for a DIY project because most often it requires no glue or nails for installation. One downside to Floating Flooring is that this flooring type doesn't add very much value to your home.Glue Down flooring is glued down to the subfloor and is typical of engineered hardwood flooring.Nail Down flooring requires a nailing process to secure the wood planks in place, this style is used commonly for solid hardwood flooring.Staple Down flooring is very similar to Nail Down in that individual pieces are more easily stabled to the subfloor and are not interlocking.

Diets of the Sympatric Pacific Sheath-Tailed Bat (Emballonura semicaudata rotensis) and Mariana Swiftlet (Aerodramus bartschi) on Aguiguan, Mariana IslandsProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2011Author(s): Valdez, E.W., G.J. Wiles, and T.J. O'SheaSuggested Citation: Valdez, E.W., G.J. Wiles, and T.J. O'Shea. 2011. Diets of the Sympatric Pacific Sheath-Tailed Bat (Emballonura semicaudata rotensis) and Mariana Swiftlet (Aerodramus bartschi) on Aguiguan, Mariana Islands. Pacific Science. 65(3): 301-309. Abstract: The Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Emb(lllonura .,emicalldata rotC11sis) and Nlariana swiftlet (AeTodramus hartscbt) are two rarc insectivorous taxa restrined to the southern Mariana Islands in western Micronesia. It is believed that populations of both have dwindled because of impacts (() their food resources. However, there is little information on the food habits ofA. battsc!?i and none exists for E. s. rotemis. Tn an effort to better understand the feeding habits of both, we investigated their diets using guano analysis. Guano "vas collected from two roosts in caves during a 2-week period in June and July at the onset of the rainy scason. Important orders of insects consumed (perecn (age volume) by bats roosting" at one cave included hymenopterans (64%), coleopterans (10%), lepidopterans (8%), isopterans (R%), and psocopterans (5 %), whereas those at a second cave included Jepidopterans (45%), hymenopterans (41 %), coleopterans (10%), and isopterans (5 'Yo)...
