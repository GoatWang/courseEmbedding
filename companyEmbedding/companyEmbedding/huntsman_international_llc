About us

































About us

We serve a broad and diverse range of consumer and industrial end markets, including: transportation, home life, construction, energy and fuels, and clothing and footwear. We develop products that address customers’ needs and help provide solutions to some of the world’s greatest challenges. Through our five divisions, we operate in more than 30 countries around the world, employing over 15,000 associates. 
Message from the Founder and Chairman
More than four decades ago, in 1970, we founded Huntsman Container Corporation.  We had no idea then that our fledgling packaging business would evolve into what has become one of the world's largest chemical companies.  Through a series of strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and carefully planned internal expansions, our operating companies today produce 33 billion pounds of products for a variety of global businesses, including chemicals, plastics, automotive, aviation, footwear, paints and coatings, construction, technology, agriculture, health care, textiles, detergent, personal care, furniture, appliances and packaging.  
Our success is due, in large measure, to the thousands of associates who work in our facilities around the world to manufacture the chemical industry's highest quality products.
We have been most fortunate to build a company of this magnitude, and it is our duty and privilege to give back to society.  Through our humanitarian initiatives, we have helped to provide food and housing to the hungry and homeless around the world; we have funded education for those who otherwise would not have been able to attend school.  
Most importantly, our dream of establishing a world class cancer research and treatment center has been realized.   The Huntsman Cancer Institute and Hospitals represents our purpose in life, and our ultimate goal will have been achieved when the most challenging forms of cancer have been eradicated.  Our family will continue to serve as the principal benefactors and fundraisers for the Huntsman Cancer Institute in the quest to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure cancer.   
Jon M. Huntsman

Huntsman International LLC Key Developments

Huntsman International LLC Enters into the Seventeenth Amendment to Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank
Jun 19 17
On June 15, 2017, Huntsman International LLC entered into the Seventeenth Amendment to Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the Lenders). Among other things, the Amendment provides for: (i) permission to enter into certain transactions in connection with the anticipated initial public offering (the IPO) of Venator Materials PLC, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (Venator) and wholly-owned subsidiary of HI formed for the purpose of holding the Pigments and Additives business (such transactions, the Venator IPO Transactions); and (ii) permission to consummate the previously announced merger of Huntsman Corporation with a wholly owned subsidiary of Clariant Ltd., a Swiss corporation (Clariant), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 21, 2017, by and among Clariant, HurricaneCyclone Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Clariant, and Huntsman Corporation. In connection with the Venator IPO Transactions, the Amendment, among other things: (i) allows for the incurrence of certain indebtedness of Venator to be held in escrow pending the effectiveness of the IPO; (ii) permits the internal restructuring of the Pigments and Additives assets, including assets of Venator in the United States to a non-guarantor restricted subsidiary; (iii) upon occurrence of the IPO, provides for the designation of Venator and its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and (iv) requires a mandatory repayment of $450 million of existing term loan indebtedness within 30 days of the occurrence of the IPO.


Huntsman International LLC Enters into the Sixteenth Amendment to Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A
Nov 16 16
On November 15, 2016, Huntsman International LLC entered into the Sixteenth Amendment to Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto. Among other things, the amendment provides for a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million (the 2021 Term B Loans) and a new term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,375 million (the 2023 Term B Loans), the proceeds of which were, in each case used, together with cash on hand, to repay in full HI’s 2014-1 Additional Term Loans due 2021 and HI’s 2016 Term B Loans due 2023. The 2021 Term B Loans have a stated maturity date of October 1, 2021 and the 2023 Term B Loans have a stated maturity date of April 1, 2023, in each case, with a springing maturity date in the event that certain earlier-maturing senior notes issued by HI are not repaid or refinanced prior to their maturity date and HI does not have sufficient cash or available lines of credit at such time. The 2021 Term B Loans and the 2023 Term B Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at the HI’s option, either LIBOR (which is subject to a 0.75% floor) or base rate (which is subject to a 1.75% floor). The margin for borrowings under the 2021 Term B Loan Facility are 2.75% for LIBOR and 1.75% for base rate. The margin for borrowings under the 2023 Term B Loan Facility are 3.00% for LIBOR and 2.00% for base rate. The 2021 Term B Loans and the 2023 Term B Loans will amortize in an amount equal to 1% of the principal amount of the 2021 Term B Loans or 2023 Term B Loans, respectively, payable quarterly commencing on December 31, 2016.


Huntsman International LLC Closes $350 Million Term Loan B Due 2021 and $1,375 Million Term Loan B Due 2023
Nov 16 16
Huntsman Corporation announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Huntsman International LLC closed a new $350 million term loan B due 2021 and a new $1,375 million term loan B due 2023. Proceeds from the new term loans were used to repay in full its previous term loan B due 2021 and term loan B due 2023.  As a result of this refinancing, the company extended $829 million of term loan maturities from 2021 to 2023 and did not increase its overall indebtedness. The interest rate for the new term loan B due 2021 is LIBOR plus 2.75% and the interest rate for the new term loan B due 2023 is LIBOR plus 3.00%, each with a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.  The company estimates that interest savings from the refinancing will be approximately $4 million per year.

History[edit]
The Huntsman Corporation was initially founded as the Huntsman Container Corporation in 1970 by Jon Huntsman, Sr. It went public as the Huntsman Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE: HUN in February 2005. Huntsman has grown through a series of acquisitions (with some divestitures) and today is a manufacturer and marketer of differentiated chemical products.
In April 1994, Huntsman acquired the Texaco Chemical company for $1.06 billion.[3] Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its last remaining petrochemicals plant to Huntsman in 1999 for about $600 million.[4]
The Huntsman Corporation became the then third-largest petrochemical business in the United States when in 1999, it acquired Imperial Chemical Industries' polyurethanes, titanium dioxide, aromatics and petrochemical global businesses for $2.8 billion.[5]
Huntsman also acquired the Performance Additives and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) businesses of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. on October 1, 2014, to become the second-largest global producer of titanium dioxide and inorganic color pigments for uses like paints and industrial coatings.[6] Huntsman paid approximately $1 billion in cash and assumed certain unfunded European pension liabilities.[7]
Terminated takeover by Access Industries[edit]
In June 2007, it was announced that Huntsman had agreed to be acquired by Access Industries, owned by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, for $5.88 billion in cash. Huntsman shareholders would receive $25.25 a share from Access Industries' chemical unit, Basell Holdings, based in Hoofddorp, Netherlands. Access would assume $3.7 billion of Huntsman debt.
However, on July 12, 2007, the agreement was terminated as Huntsman agreed to be bought by Apollo Management for $6.51 billion or $28 a share.[8] Huntsman filed a suit against Apollo Management and its two partners in Texas after the group backed out of the deal to purchase the chemical company. The suit alleged fraud against Apollo Management as Huntsman believed that the group never intended to allow its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit to buy Huntsman Corp. for $6.5 billion. Huntsman also claimed Apollo put forth a higher bid to prevent the Basell AF buyout as it would have threatened Hexion's market share. Hexion stated Huntsman's declining financial position as the reason the deal was terminated.[9] Upon termination of the Hexion merger agreement, the Huntsman stock value dropped by almost 50%.
In December 2008, Apollo and Hexion agreed to pay Huntsman $1 billion in return for Huntsman dropping all charges against them. A suit against the funding banks was settled in 2009 for $632 million in cash and $1.1 billion in loans to the Huntsman Corporation.[10]
Merger of equals: HuntsmanClariant[edit]
In May 2017, Huntsman and Clariant announced that they would merge, as equals, forming HuntsmanClariant which would be the global leader in speciality chemical production - with the deal valued at $20 billion.[11][12] Clariant shareholders will own 52% of the new entity, with Huntsman shareholders owning the remaining 48% of shares.[13][14]
Business segments[edit]
Advanced Materials is a supplier of synthetic and formulated polymer systems. Huntsman’s epoxy, acrylic and polyurethane-based polymer products are used to replace traditional materials in aircraft, automobiles and electrical power transmission.
Polyurethanes manufactures MDI-based polyurethane solutions used in an extensive range of applications and market sectors. Polyurethanes provide key benefits of energy efficiency, comfort, and well-being. Insulation products conserve energy in housing and commercial properties and play a critical role in the food supply chain – keeping products at the right temperature in refrigerated vehicles, chiller cabinets, and refrigerators. Polyurethanes also provide comfort and well-being in automotive seating, furniture, bedding, and footwear. Adhesive products, coatings, and elastomers are used extensively throughout consumer and industrial applications.
Performance Products manufactures products primarily based on amines, carbonates, surfactants and maleic anhydride. End uses include agrochemicals, oil and gas and alternative energy solutions, home detergents and personal care products, adhesives and coatings, mining, and polyurethane/epoxy curing agents.
Pigments and Additives is a manufacturer of titanium dioxide pigments and additives used to add performance and color to items such as paints, inks, plastics and concrete to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food.
Textile Effects manufactures and markets textile dyes and chemicals that enhance color and improve performance such as fade resistance, UV-blocking and the ability to repel water and stains in apparel, home, and technical textiles.
