Credit Acceptance 2nd Quarter 2017 Earnings Call
Jul 31, 2017 at 5:00 PM ET



	Credit Acceptance was founded in 1972 by Don Foss, one of the world's largest independent used car dealers in the 1970's and 1980's. Credit Acceptance is an indirect auto finance company, working with car dealers nationwide to enable them to sell cars to consumers on credit regardless of their credit history. Without our product, consumers may be unable to purchase a vehicle, may purchase an unreliable one, or may not have the opportunity to improve their credit score.

	Credit Acceptance believes that individuals, if given the opportunity to establish or re-establish a positive credit history, will take advantage of that opportunity. By making timely monthly payments on their financed vehicles, many of our customers improve their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing.

	Our Guaranteed Credit Approval program provides automotive dealers with the opportunity to deliver credit approvals to consumers within 30 seconds through the Internet using our patented Credit Approval Processing System (CAPS®.)

I'm seeing alot of negative comments about Credit Acceptance.  I bought a car they financed in 2013.  I was late alot of the time, due to being divorced.  The never charged me late fees or tried to reposess the car.  If I couldn't afford the monthly payment, I always paid something.  I was 90 days past due sometime.  The car is paid off now and received the title in 2 weeks.  If you can't make your full payment, pay them something.  It is what probably stopped them from repossession.

I had always paid cash for pretty much everything. A car lot had a truck I liked and Credit Acceptance was their lender. Down payment wasn't bad, payments weren't bad and a year later my credit was almost non-existent to 740. Their customer service was always friendly and helpful. I can't say how they react to late payments as I had mine taken directly out of my bank account. I found something I liked better and traded in my truck and tacked the negative equity onto the new car (almost a wash as I got the car for the right price so I didn't break it off in myself). They are a good jump-off point if you need something to drive and want to establish credit. Can't say a bad thing about them.

WARNING: CREDIT ACCEPTANCE ARE SCAMMERS!!! They prey on desperate people who have bad credit. Yes, you will get approved but they have accidently repoed my car, have RUDE customer service after accidently taking my vehicle. Not only arte their interest rates high, they also like to hit people with misc. fees. They tell you that ou have monthly payments but your payments are weekly. For that reason they can take your car even if it is a few days late. The customer service reps are ghetto and can barely speak proper english. Supervisor are unprofessional and  they try their best to belittle people. Whatever you do, do not sign a contract with these people. Its not a real company. They are more like loan sharks.

They gave me a chance to get a decent car when no one else would.  I had to put a big down payment on it, but it was because I was extremely irresponsible with my credit.  The dealership I got the car from was pretty good and I am still driving the same car 12 years later.  I am grateful I was able to get something with my crappy credit and paid the car off in 3 years.

                                    Anonymous                                                    Borrower





those of you thinking of using credit acceptance.. DONT DO IT. We have been makig our payments on time every month for over 1 1/2 yrs (half of our contract of 3 yrs)  Jay called to see what the balance was that we owed, THEY TOLD US THAT DUE TO IT BEING A "NEW YEAR" MORE INTEREST OF 110% KICKED IN AND NOW WE OWE THE ENTIRE -ENTIRE- AMOUNT AGAIN. we went from owing about 6,000 to 13000!  who does that?! They literally keep you in debt... this is absolutely ridiculous. Now its going to look bad on us even though we have paid them! 	DO NOT USE CREDIT ACCEPTANCE. They will scam you into debt for a vehicle not even worth a 3rd of the price. 	I have a 2007 toyota rav 4 its worth 6,000 if you buy it.. this company wanted 12,000 after interest.. so we made payments of 480 a month. Got down to half the amount and all of a sudden its up to 13000 because we didnt pay it off completely fast enough. They said it was in the contract (probbably fine print). so they scam you out of a vehicle and money!! In all they basically wanted 24,000 for a car worth 6,000!  All because your credit is bad, yet they set you up to fail so you never pay them off which obviously makes your credit worse. 	Do not do it!!!!

It's a proven fact that customer financing is an increasingly important tool to help customers achieve their purchasing desires and purchase what they want, when they want it. When cash is tight, credit cards are maxed and banks are freezing credit, customers need financing options to pay for auto repairs, make home improvements, purchase luxury products and more. Let Consumer Acceptance Corp effectively offer financing to your cash strapped customers in order to create  a positive buying experience for your customers and you'll get the results you want: more sales and increased revenue.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
