ORIGINAL COMPLAINT 
TO THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT: 
Plaintiff, Flotek Industries, Inc. (“Flotek” or “Plaintiff”) files this Original Complaint 
against Defendants Gates Capital Management, Inc., Gates Capital Management, L.P., Gates 
Capital Management GP, LLC, and Jeffrey L. Gates (together, “Gates Capital Defendants”) and 
fund entities Gates Capital Partners LLC, ECF Value Fund, L.P., ECF Value Fund II, L.P., ECF 
Value Fund International Ltd., and ECF Fund International Master L.P. (together, the “Fund 
Entities,” and together with Gates Capital Defendants, the “Defendants” or the “Gates Capital

Flotek’s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the “Exchange Act”). 
2. Defendant, Gates Capital Management, Inc. (“Gates Capital”), an investment 
adviser, together with its relying adviser, Gates Capital Management, L.P. (“Gates LP”), Gates 
Capital Management GP, LLC (“Gates GP”) and Jeffrey L. Gates, acted as an investment adviser 
to, for, and on behalf of three hedge funds: ECF Value Fund, L.P. (“ECF Fund”), ECF Value 
Fund II, L.P. (“ECF Fund II”), and ECF Value Fund International Master, L.P. (“Master Fund”) 
(with ECF Value Fund International Ltd. (“Feeder Fund”) as feeder to Master Fund). 
3. The Gates Capital Defendants together with the Fund Entities realized “short 
swing” profits in trading common stock, $0.0001 par value, of Flotek in violation of Section 
16(b) of the Exchange Act (“Section 16(b)”). 
4. Defendants agreed to act together for the purposes of acquiring, holding, voting, 
disposing or trading of Flotek common stock and therefore formed a “group” under Section 
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act (“Section 13(d)”). 
5. At all relevant times, Gates Capital Group held more than 10% beneficial 
ownership of Flotek common stock subjecting them to Section 16(b) liability as a beneficial 
owner. Gates Capital Group is not exempt from Section 16(b) liability because they did not 
beneficially own Flotek common stock for the benefit of third parties in the ordinary course of 
business. 
6. Defendants garnered millions of dollars in disgorgeable short-swing profits 
through the purchase and sale of millions of shares within several six month periods from June

18. Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act provides that “[ery person who is directly 
or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of any equity 
security…which is registered pursuant to” section 12 of the Exchange Act who is a “director or Case 4:16-cv-03584 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/06/16 Page 4 of 11


-5- 
HOU:3733669.6 
an officer of the issuer of such security” must file certain statements/reports with the SEC. 15 
U.S.C. § 78p(a)(1). 
19. Under 16(b) of the Exchange Act, any profit realized by such beneficial owner 
“from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase” of those securities “within any period of 
less than six months…shall be…recoverable by the issuer.” U.S.C. § 78p(b). Section 16(b) 
“imposes strict liability regardless of motive, including trades not actually based on inside 
information.” Dreiling v. Am. Express Co., 458 F.3d 942, 947 (9th Cir. 2006). 
20. SEC Rule 16a-l(a)(l) promulgated under the Exchange Act sets forth how the term 
beneficial owner is defined for the purposes of Section 16(b) liability. It notes that a “beneficial 
owner” means “any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section 13(d) of the 
[Exchange
Act and the rules thereunder
.
” 17 C.F.R. 240.16a-1(a)(1). Section 13(d)(3) of the 
Exchange Act, as clarified by SEC Rule 13-d-5, states: 
“[w
o
re persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, 
holding, voting or disposing of equity securities of an issue, the group formed 
thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, for purposes of 
sections 13(d) and (g) of the [Exchange as of the date of such agreement, of 
all equity securities of that issuer beneficially owned by any such persons. 
17 C.F.R. § 240.13d-5(b)(1)(2015). 
21. “Persons” include individuals, corporations, partnerships, associates, joint-stock 
companies, trust funds, or “any organized group of persons whether incorporated or not.” 15 
U.S.C. § 80(a)-2(a)(28); 15 U.S.C. § 80(a)-2(a)(8). Where two or more persons "act as a 
partnership, limited partnership, syndicate, or other group for the purpose of acquiring, holding, 
or disposing of securities of an issuer,” such persons are deemed to be a “group.” 15 U.S.C. 
§ 78(m)(d)(3); 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-1(a)(1); Greenfield v. Cadian Capital Mgmt., LP, No. 1:15-
cv-04478-ER, 2016 WL 5793416, *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2016). Case 4:16-cv-03584 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/06/16 Page 5 of 11


-6- 
HOU:3733669.6 
22. Under SEC Rule 13d-5, Rule 16a-1, the shares held by persons in such a group 
are aggregated to determine whether the group has a greater than 10% beneficial ownership in 
the issuing corporation. If the aggregate number of shares beneficially owned by the group 
exceeds 10%, each member of the group is deemed to be a greater than 10% beneficial owner 
and is liable to disgorge profits which such group member earns in stock transactions effected 
within a less than a six-month period. Cadian Capital, 2016 WL 5793416, at *1. 
23. Group activity can be found even where the agreement between the parties lacks 
definite terms. Further, the agreement may be formal or informal and may be proved through 
direct or circumstantial evidence. Dreiling v. America Online Inc., 578 F.3d 995, 1003 (9th Cir. 
2009). 
24. “[Tmeaning of Section 13(d) is that the 
members combined in furtherance of a common objective.” Wellman v. Dickinson, 682 F.2d 355, 
363 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1069 (1983). The plain language of the statute does 
not require a group to be committed to any “specific set of terms,” but rather, “demands only an 
agreement for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of securities.” Morales v. Freund, 
163 F.3d 763, 767 n.5 (2d Cir. 1999); Morales v. Quintel Entertainment, Inc., 249 F.3d 115, 124-
25 (2d Cir. 2001). Additionally, parties can agree to act in furtherance of some common 
objective. 
V. 
G
ROUP ACTIVITY 
25. In this case, the disclosed relationships and commonalities between and among 
the Gates Capital Defendants and Fund Entities permit the inference that the Defendants agreed 
to act together for the purposes of acquiring, holding, and disposing of Flotek common stock. It 
is difficult to draw any other conclusion. Gates Capital’s Form ADV filing was made on behalf Case 4:16-cv-03584 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/06/16 Page 6 of 11


-7- 
HOU:3733669.6 
of Gates Capital and its relying adviser Gates LP, listing all of the Fund Entities, showing that all 
of the Defendants are under common control.
1
The Gates Capital Defendants all bear the same 
Gates Capital name and have the same registered agent in Delaware. Most all of the Gates 
Capital Defendants and Fund Entities operate out of the same office in New York, which is the 
business address of Mr. Jeffrey Gates as well.
2
Each of the Fund Entities employed the same 
auditor located in New York (where Gates Capital is located), the same prime broker in New 
York, and the same custodians. 
26. Furthermore, the ownership and management relationships among all of the 
Defendants form a complete web. Jeffrey L. Gates is the sole shareholder, President, and 
portfolio manager of Gates Capital. Gates Capital is in turn the managing member (and 75% or 
more owner) of Gates GP. Gates GP is the general partner of Gates LP. Gates LP is the relying 
adviser to Gates Capital and the investment adviser to all of Fund Entities. The Feeder Fund 
invests in the Master Fund, whose general partner is Gates Partners. Gates Partners is also the 
general partner of each of ECF Fund and ECF Fund II. All of the Gates Capital Defendants and 
the Fund Entities are linked. 
27. Stated differently, Gates Capital manages the Fund Entities and controls the Fund 
Entities’ holdings in Flotek through the corporate structure. Three of the Fund Entities share a 
general partner (Gates Partners). The one Fund Entity that does not share that general partner 
(the Feeder Fund), invests into the Master Fund (which does have the same general partner, 
Gates Partners). Moreover, Gates LP's stated principal business purposes is to serve as

investment manager to three of the Fund Entities

and is controlled by an entity (Gates GP) 
whose managing member is Gates Capital. 
28. Defendants therefore constitute a group for purposes of determining beneficial 
ownership under §§ 13(d)(3) and 16(b) of the Exchange Act. At all relevant times, the Gates 
Capital Group was a greater than 10% beneficial owner of Flotek common stock and the 
Defendants are therefore subject to liability under Section 16(b). Gates Capital Group garnered 
short-swing profits in a series of the transactions within certain six month periods set forth herein 
in violation of Section 16(b); these profits should be disgorged. 
VI. 
G
ATES CAPITAL’S OWNERSHIP IN THE FUND ENTITIES 
29. Gates Capital had a financial incentive to create the Fund Entities and manage 
their investments, as Gates Capital and/or Gates LP earned a management fee of an unknown 
percentage of the assets under management as well as performance-based fees. 
30. Because the Gates Capital Defendants had an interest in the Fund Entities, those 
entities did not beneficially own Flotek common stock for the benefit of third parties in the 
ordinary course of business. Therefore, the registered investment advisor exemption from 
Section 16(b) liability under 17 C.F.R. § 240.16a-1(a)(1)(v), providing that registered investment 
advisors under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or under the laws of any state 
“shall not be deemed the beneficial owner of securities of such class held for the benefit of third 
parties or in customer of fiduciary accounts in the ordinary course of business” is not applicable 
to the Gates Capital Defendants.

HOU:3733669.6 
VII. 
P
URCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS 
31. While the Gates Capital Group was a greater than 10% beneficial owner, the 
Defendants purchased and sold shares of Flotek common stock at various times within several 
six month periods between 2014 and 2016. For example, the Gates Capital Group purchased at 
least 2,628,781 shares between March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 and sold at least 3,524,154 
shares between June 30, 2015 and September 31, 2015. Additionally, the Gates Capital Group 
purchased at least 3,870,117 shares between December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 and sold at 
least 2,132,775 shares between March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 
32. The Gates Capital Group also violated Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act by 
failing to report its greater than 10% beneficial ownership on SEC Form 3, which is required to 
be filed under SEC Rule 16a-3. The Gates Capital Group continued to violate Section 16(a) and 
SEC Rule 16a-3 by failing to report its purchases and shares of Flotek common stock on SEC 
Form 4 while the Gates Capital Group was a greater than 10% beneficial owner. Due to these 
SEC reporting violations, it is not possible to compute with precision the amount of short-swing 
profits garnered by the Gates Capital Group from its short-swing trading shares of Flotek 
common stock. Upon information and belief, short-swing profits total in the millions of dollars. 
VIII. 
C
LAIM I AGAINST THE GATES CAPITAL GROUP 
33. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 
32 as if fully set forth herein. 
34. As alleged in paragraphs 31 and 32 herein, during several six month periods, the 
Gates Capital Group engaged in purchase and sale transactions in Flotek common stock, which 
resulted in disgorgeable short-swing profits. Case 4:16-cv-03584 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/06/16 Page 9 of 11


-10- 
HOU:3733669.6 
35. Each of the Defendants is liable for its respective short-swing profits. 
IX. 
C
LAIM II AGAINST THE GATES CAPITAL DEFENDANTS 
36. Flotek repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 35 
as if fully set forth herein. 
37. As alleged in paragraphs 25 through 28 herein, the Gates Capital Defendants are 
members of the Gates Capital Group who engaged in transactions on behalf of the Fund Entities, 
which yielded short-swing profits subject to disgorgement. 
38. As alleged in paragraphs 29 through 30 herein, the Gates Capital Defendants have 
pecuniary interests in short-swing profits realized by the Fund Entities and are liable to disgorge 
to Plaintiff their short-swing profits to the extent of their respective pecuniary interests in the 
transactions. 
39. Plaintiff is unable to precisely compute the Gates Capital Defendants’ pecuniary 
interests in the transactions.

RAYER 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Flotek Industries, Inc., prays the Court grant disgorgement of 
profits made in violation of federal securities laws, actual damages, attorneys’ fees, pre and post-
judgment interest, and any such other and further relief to which Plaintiff may be entitled. Case 4:16-cv-03584 Document 1 Filed in TXSD on 12/06/16 Page 10 of 11
