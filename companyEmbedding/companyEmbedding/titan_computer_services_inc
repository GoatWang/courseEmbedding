specifically altitude training. The Company will generate revenue through
Northern, Central, and South America sales by way of its sole distribution
agreement with Woodway Inc. Our objective is to be recognized as one of the
upper tier specialty altitude training equipment providers.
The acquisition of Altitude International, Inc. was a material transaction to
our existing operations.
Accordingly, we are providing below the information that would be included in a
Form 10 if we were to file a Form 10. Please note that the information provided
below relates to the combined enterprises after the acquisition of Altitude
International, Inc., except that information relating to periods prior to the
date of the acquisition of Altitude only relate to Titan Computer Services,
unless otherwise specifically indicated.


                                    BUSINESS


Corporate History
Altitude International, Inc. specializes in creating uniquely-engineered,
membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training environments. The product
line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental
rooms and chambers. Through a license agreement with Sporting Edge UK Ltd, a
brand well-established in the United Kingdom, the Company intends to expand its
technology into the American marketplace, where the appetite for increasing
performance in elite athletes, professional sports, equine sports, and
universities and colleges is immense.
Business Strategy
The Company will seek to set itself apart from other altitude training
technology by introducing to elite athletes, health and fitness clubs, and
profession sports teams novel training techniques proven to increase
performance. The Company has developed technology and training protocols that
make possible large improvements in fitness and performance in normal room
environments. The well-financed sports market of North America offers the
Company opportunities to manufacture and distribute its products to a welcoming
customer base
Industry Operating Environment
Whether at the Olympic level or in professional and college teams - top level
sports require individuals to perform at their maximum potential.  Margins
between success and failure are small - the difference between first and last in
the Tour de France is three percent - and athletes constantly seek to close the
gap between success and failure.
Many American athletes currently engage in altitude training by travelling to
elevations of about 6,000ft to train in air with decreased oxygen levels. Though
this type of training has its benefits, it does not come without costs.
Traveling creates a disruption to an athlete's normal training schedule as well
as considerable economic costs to travel and train in those locations.
Altitude's licensed technology allows for all the benefits of altitude training
without the disruptions of travel.
U.S. suppliers of altitude training equipment exist but they use an entirely
different technology that almost entirely focuses on a mask based approach.
This cumbersome approach is not favored by the athletes, and impedes normal
breathing patterns.  Altitude's approach is to create room environments that are
not only precisely controllable for simulated altitude level, but also for
temperature and humidity - allowing the climate of almost any location on the
planet to be replicated.  This allows many combinations of altitude, heat and
humidity stresses to be created and also provides for pre-acclimatization of
players about to compete outside their normal climate zone.  These additional
stresses deliver increased benefits compared to altitude training alone.
Development
The product designs to be licensed from Sporting Edge UK Ltd are proven and
cover a wide range of room sizes.  The only requirement is to change from metric
to imperial sizes where necessary.


                                       2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three unique elements to the Altitude proposition:
· Sophisticated Touch Screen control systems capable of integrating the control
  of simulated altitude, temperature and humidity.
· A unique design of Air Separation Unit with only a single active part that
  provides for ultra-reliable operation and a design life of greater than fifteen
  years.



· Proven training protocols that allow the desired training benefits to be
  achieved.
We have included some photos of what our systems will look like:

                               [[Image Removed]]

Altitude will lease space in the Woodway facility in Waukesha, Wisconsin to
undertake the manufacture of systems.  The work will primarily consist of the
assembly of components into the unique licensed designs.  Initial recruitment of
technically-capable persons will be necessary, followed by short training blocks
to pass on the required skills.  At least one person is likely to visit the UK
to see systems in operation and obtain hands-on experience of the manufacturing
requirement.  Woodway is an engineering-based company and so is a perfect
environment in which to establish an operation which is in many ways similar to
their own.  In addition, many aspects of infrastructure - goods handling,
welfare facilities, etc. - can be accessed immediately without expense to
Altitude.

When a public company that is not a shell company completes a Share Exchange or

We will not receive any proceeds from the sales of shares of our common stock by
the selling stockholders. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling stockholders.


We believe that Tekmark Global Solutions LLC, a company that offers a range of
IT, telecom, financial, consulting and staffing services, Galaxy Systems Inc., a
company providing IT consulting and recruiting in the placement industry and
Pivotal Solutions, Inc., an IT staffing company of which our director, Steven
Edelman, is the chief executive officer, are staffing solutions competitors
and Rainking Software, Inc., Monster Worldwide, Inc. and DiscoverOrg Inc. are
providers of software for IT staffing and business intelligence with which we
compete.

However, there is no comparable offer currently in the market of which we are
aware that provides:
 
. The full range of personnel at each company from management level all the way
  down to junior IT staff; and

. The depth of information for a passive IT professional candidate (phone,
  email, place of employment, position, technical skills used in last 5 years).
 
We expect that GreenTree Magic Software will separate itself from the
competition through an affordable pricing structure. We initially intend to
charge licensing fees at prices below industry standards in order to increase
market share and develop brand awareness. In addition to targeting large
companies, we believe his will allow us to also target mid-size companies
seeking a strategic edge over the competition as well as smaller price-conscious
companies, traditional placement agencies and individuals. Our clients will be
able to use the business intelligence in our software to improve their staffing
practices through enhanced recruiting methods, and generate sales leads through
targeted business intelligence. We aim to make the most up to date business
intelligence readily available for our clients.
 
However, larger companies with greater resources and recognition than us may
enter the market which may make competition more difficult.


Company Description
We were incorporated on July 13, 1994 in the State of New York to recruit and
provide an array of IT personnel for businesses. In April 2015, we purchased
from Green Tree Software LLC a 49% interest in its product called GreenTree
Magic Software, which contains a database that provides access to


 information on
IT professionals in the industry. In addition to technical qualifications of IT
staff for companies included in the database, it provides business intelligence
that allows companies to find other businesses that may need their services. The
database includes contact information, type of technology used, management
information and real-time leads that we believe will enable companies to better
target their recruiting efforts. The software was primarily completed during
the fourth quarter of 2015 followed by beta testing and additional population of
the data fields during the early part of the first quarter of 2016 following
which, initial marketing of the software commenced. To date, two licenses have
been sold.
 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 92 Southgate Drive, Spring Valley, NY
10977 and our telephone number is (212) 390-8311. Our website: 
www.titan-computers.com.
