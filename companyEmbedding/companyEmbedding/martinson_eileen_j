Eileen Martinson
Chief Executive Officer  
With a quarter century of executive leadership experience in the enterprise software industry, Chief Executive Officer Eileen Martinson provides Sparta Systems with focused vision, leadership and strategic direction.
 
Since Eileen joined in July 2011, the company has more than doubled revenue, while maintaining strong profitability and transforming itself from a steady state to accelerated growth company. Eileen led a competitive and successful transaction in mid-2014 that resulted in the company’s sale to leading private equity firm Thoma Bravo. The company looks to continue its successes by leveraging organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
 
Eileen’s commitment to “Winning as a Team” is the cornerstone of the company’s value system, and ensures success by encompassing not only employees as part of the team, but customers and partners as well. In addition, she is a strong proponent of driving a performance based culture to help define what “winning” means.
 
Among numerous individual and company honors received during her time at Sparta, Eileen was named New Jersey Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year and New Jersey CEO of the year, while the company was recognized as a New Jersey Tech Council Software Company of the Year and was also recognized by NJ Biz as a “Best Place to Work.”
 
Prior to joining Sparta Systems, Eileen was the Chief Operating Officer of Allscripts, a provider of clinical software, information and connectivity solutions for physicians, where she drove significant growth in profits and revenue and developed an extensive product portfolio. She was also instrumental in helping the company to successfully merge with Eclipsys, a $1.3 billion transaction.
 
Further, as Misys’ Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Services, Eileen played a critical role in its return to accelerated growth and during its acquisition and integration of Allscripts assets.
 
In addition, Eileen had key executive responsibilities at SAP during its formative hyper growth years in the mid-1990’s, improving revenues from $100 million to more than a $1 billion. In the mid-2000’s, as Siebel Systems’ Senior Vice President of Global Services, she had general manager responsibility and helped to create the Customer Experience Blueprint Program, which was later issued a U.S. patent. She subsequently joined Oracle’s North American executive team as the SVP of NA Consulting, a more than $1 billion organization with over 5,000 employees.
 
Eileen graduated summa cum laude with a B.S in Finance from Philadelphia University, where she is Chair of the Board of Trustees and is the recipient of the PhilaU 2012 Leader of Innovation Medal.  She is also an independent board director at Advanced MD and CDK Global, a publicly traded software company.

This interview with Eileen Martinson, chief executive of Sparta Systems, a maker of quality-management software, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. When you were a child, were you in leadership roles or doing entrepreneurial things?A. Yes. I was babysitting from the time I was 9 or 10. I had the whole neighborhood. And when I was in high school, every job I had would migrate to leadership roles. I worked as a volunteer at a camp one summer — the next summer, I was leading all the camp counselors and getting paid. I’d work in retail and become a supervisor.Q. Any sense of where you got your drive?A. My father was a very ambitious and driven man. He set a very high bar. A “B” was a failure in his eyes. Sometimes I wonder if he knew of the potential I had and maybe raised the bar to make sure that I pushed. But I’ve always been very passionate about everything I do. If I’m going to do something, I can’t just check the box. I have to put my heart and soul into it.Q. What about your college years?A. When I graduated from high school, I started working in a manufacturing company as an order-entry clerk. Within a few years, I was the customer service manager, making double what many of my friends were going to make coming out of college. So I was in a dilemma. I knew I needed my degree, but I certainly wasn’t going to quit this wonderful job to go back to school.

I ultimately went through 13 years of night school. The last few years were tough because I was working full time, and at that point, I was married and had two children. Continue reading the main story

Q. I assume everybody you were managing in that first role was older than you.A. I didn’t really know anything about managing at the time, but I treated people with respect. I also learned to be self-aware, and to really stop and listen. Because if you stop and see the way people are perceiving you, you can eliminate a lot of mistakes. Listening and self-awareness are huge for me. I still have to practice and remind myself of that every day.Q. Tell me about your approach to leadership today.A. I focus on the people first — getting the right team — then setting audacious goals, with clear metrics for measuring progress. And I always say that if we’re not making mistakes, we’re not going fast enough because we’re being too careful. But you have to learn from your mistakes.

I’ve learned to be incredibly clear about what we’re trying to do, how we’re going to get there and the outcomes I want from the team. And then when I get that team in place, they can cascade the goals down through the organization so that the front-line people know exactly where we’re going. I’ll say, “If you can’t see how what you’re doing today fits my scorecard, then you need to talk to your boss, because we’re misaligned.” If you don’t have that, then people go off in a lot of directions. They do a lot of work, but they are not really getting to the result that you’re looking for with the company.A boss taught me a long time ago that people are going to remember only two to three things. When I joined my current company, I had a worldwide meeting on Day 1 and I put up a chart that said we’re going to more than double revenues over the next few years. The employees completely understand where we are going, and we’ve built a culture around that. If you have to come in and show me 45 charts and go through a lot of mumbo jumbo that neither of us understands, it’s not going to work. Tell me the story. If you can tell the story, then people can get excited about it.Q. This is your first C.E.O. role. Anything that surprised you?A. I was in two chief operating officer roles before this. I was a great No. 2, at much bigger companies than this. I was very comfortable being No. 2. I had people over the years push me to become a C.E.O., but I said, “No, this is the right spot for me.” My husband really inspired me. He is a very successful venture capitalist, and he said, “It’s time.” It took some courage to make the leap. It’s a very lonely role, being a C.E.O. As the two C.E.O.'s I worked with before said, it was time for me to clean up my mistakes. It was the best thing I ever did. I probably should have done it sooner.

Q. Let’s talk about hiring.A. I spend a lot of time talking about the outcomes I’m trying to achieve, and I’ll write down the five most important things that need to get done in the job. Then I’ll ask them, “Give me an example of something you did that fits this.” They might have done wonderful things in their career, but if they’re not the things I need right now, they are probably not the right person. There are many “A” players, but is this the “A” player I need?Q. What other questions do you ask?A. I’m always curious if they’ve ever played any competitive team sports. I also want to know: “What is the most inspirational thing you’ve done in your life outside of work? What are you most proud of?”And then I ask them for a tough situation — what did they do, and what did they learn? I’m mostly looking at their body language when they answer that question. I wake up every day and I’m happy. I’m just not capable of staying down. So do people look like they’re spiraling down when they’re describing a tough situation?Q. What career advice do you give students?A. I’m big on frameworks, and I tell students they need to develop a personal framework around emotional intelligence. It’s about thinking globally and learning how to communicate.

I also have a big concern that people don’t sit down and write letters anymore. When I gave the convocation speech at Philadelphia University, I told the students that I checked the campus store, and they actually have stamps and paper. And I said, “I want you to write a thank-you note to whoever did the most for you to get here.” A lot of the students actually did it.
