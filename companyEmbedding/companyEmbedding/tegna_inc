Tegna, Inc. (stylized as TEGNA) is an American publicly traded broadcast, digital media and marketing services company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[1] It was created on June 29, 2015, when Gannett Company split into two publicly traded companies. Tegna comprised the more profitable broadcast television and digital media divisions of the old Gannett, while Gannett's publishing interests were spun off as a "new" company that retained the Gannett name. Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations in 38 markets, and is the largest group owner of stations affiliated with NBC and CBS and the fourth-largest group owner of stations affiliated with ABC and holds properties in digital media.

History[edit]
In June 2015, Gannett split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which would retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey – who led Gannett's newspaper group – would serve as CEO of the former company, leaving the remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Gracia Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures (a joint venture between Tegna and several other media companies) for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[2][3]
As part of the separation, the company announced that the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—a partial anagram of "Gannett".[4] The spin-out was structured so that Tegna is the legal successor to the "old" Gannett, while the "new" Gannett is legally considered a new company. The split was completed on June 29, 2015. Tegna retained "old" Gannett's stock price history, though it trades under a new ticker symbol, TGNA. The "new" Gannett inherited old Gannett's longtime ticker symbol, GCI.[5]
Tegna also retained G/O Digital, a digital marketing services brand that it launched in August 2013, and the 20 broadcast stations it acquired from Belo Corporation in December 2013 and the six stations it acquired from London Broadcasting Company in July 2014.[1][6][7]
In September 2016, Tegna announced plans to spin off Cars.com to create two independent publicly traded companies. Tegna shareholders approved an initial public offering of Cars.com as a publicly-traded spin-off in May 2017.[8][9] Shortly after, Tegna completed the spin-off of Cars.com, which now trades under a new ticker symbol, CARS.[10]
Upon the completion of the spin-off, Dave Lougee, president of Tegna Media, was named president and CEO of Tegna and joined the company’s Board of Directors. Gracia Martore, president and CEO of Tegna, retired and stepped down from the Board.[11]
Prior to the company’s completion of the spin-off of Cars.com, it was reported by DealReporter that Nexstar Media Group may be considering a bid to acquire Tegna.[12]
In June of 2017, TEGNA announced it had entered into a definitive agreement, together with the other owners of CareerBuilder, to sell CareerBuilder to an investor group led by investments funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.[13]
Assets[edit]
Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations located in 38 markets (including seven duopolies).[14] 18 of the company's stations are affiliated with NBC (including a semi-satellite of KCEN-TV and a digital subchannel of KBMT), ten are affiliated with CBS, nine are affiliated with ABC, and three are affiliated with Fox. In addition, the company owns two CW affiliates, three MyNetworkTV affiliates and one independent station.
It also provides operational services to KTTU in Tucson through shared services agreements with Tucker Operating Co.

Television Shows[edit]
In 2015, Tegna Media test-ran a limited-run informative talk show hosted by Dallas-based bishop T. D. Jakes on its owned stations in Dallas, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cleveland. The show, titled T.D. Jakes, was co-produced by Debmar-Mercury, Tegna Media, 44 Blue Productions, Jakes' own production company, TDJ Enterprises and EnLight Productions and lasted from August 17 through September 11.[16]
On December 9, Tegna greenlit the series for an entire run for the 2016–2017 broadcast season. The series debuted on September 12 on most, if not all Tegna-owned stations, as well as several large markets, including Baltimore (WMAR), Detroit (WMYD), Orlando (WFTV/WRDQ), Chicago (WCIU), San Antonio (KSAT), and San Diego (KGTV). Debmar-Mercury, however is not participating in the production run, being replaced by independent company Flow Media Partners.[17]
T.D. Jakes will be ending in September 2017.[18]
Digital Sites[edit]
Gannett Company spun-off most of its internet media properties to Tegna.[19] When the total internet media division was part of the Gannett Company, it managed the websites for USA Today, as well as Gannett's newspaper and broadcast properties throughout the United States. It owns:

G/O Digital[20]
Premion[21]
CareerBuilder[22][a]




^ Owns 12.5% stake along with majority owners Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, as well as minority owners The McClatchy Company and Tribune Media.

Other Notes:

1 KTVY, KOLD-TV and WALA-TV were acquired with Gannett's purchase of The Detroit News, but were subsequently spun off to Knight-Ridder a day later in order for Gannett to comply with the FCC's then-current limits on group ownership.
2 Owned by Sander Media, LLC, Gannett operated these stations through a shared services agreement (SSA).
3 As part of the Gannett/Belo merger, KMOV, KTVK, and KASW were transferred to Sander Media, LLC; Gannett planned to operate the stations through shared service agreements. However, on December 16, 2013, the Department of Justice ordered that the parties (Gannett, Belo and Sander) had a period of 120 days to divest KMOV to a government-approved independent third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with KSDK. On December 23, shortly after the approval and completion of the Gannett/Belo deal, Meredith Corporation announced that it would purchase KMOV, KTVK and KASW in a $407.4 million deal.[25] The KMOV sale was completed on February 28, 2014.[26] The KTVK/KASW sale was completed on June 19.[27]
4 KTTU is owned by Tucker Operating Co, LLC. Both KTTU and KMSB (owned by Sander Media, LLC) are operated through a SSA by Raycom Media CBS affiliate KOLD-TV.
5 WDAN-TV changed call letters to WICD following its sale, and in 1967 was merged with WCHU (channel 33) in Champaign into the present-day WICD on channel 15.
6 Gannett purchased the construction permit for WINR-TV and signed the station on in 1957. Because of this, WHEC-TV and WDAN-TV are the only television stations built from the ground-up by Gannett.
7 WHEC-TV's frequency was shared with WVET-TV, owned by Veterans Broadcasting, from its 1953 sign-on until 1961 when Gannett purchased full ownership of the frequency.

TEGNA Inc. (TGNA) Q2 Earnings: A Disappointment in Store?


July 27, 2017, 06:59:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 TV broadcasting station operator, TEGNA Inc. TGNA  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 1, before market opens. Last quarter, TEGNA's bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.56%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Factors at   Play                                                                                   The price performance of TEGNA has been depressing over the last six months. The stock lost 32.9%, whereas the industry  gained 12% over the same time frame.    The U.S. broadcast TV industry has long been grappling with declining advertising revenues and global economic volatility.  In addition, the broadcast TV industry is categorized as an intensely competitive one. TEGNA's major competitors include CBS Corp. CBS  , Gray Television Inc. GTN  and Entercom Communications Corp. (ETM). Also, TEGNA's consistent loss in digital business might hurt its long-term operations. The media and entertainment industry is one of the rapidly changing areas in the economy. Massive technical changes in content creation, aggregation, and distribution platforms have rendered the traditional business model unprofitable. Such technological changes and their latest upgrades add to the company's programming costs and expenses, which are likely to affect the bottom line. On the other hand, TEGNA recently sold its 40.5% stake in web portal, CareerBuilder, to an investor group led by Apollo Global Management and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board. The company expects to collect almost $250 million from this sale, which will be used to clear off existing debt. TEGNA also completed the spinoff of its auto-sales website, Cars.com, into two publicly traded companies - TEGNA and Cars.com. The decision is likely to generate more value for investors than the current stock price of the company. Both broadcast TV and digital platforms are rapidly evaluating.  Earnings   Whispers            Our proven model does not conclusively show that TEGNA is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  Earnings ESP   and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.  Zacks ESP:  TEGNA has an Earnings ESP of -10%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 27 cents ,  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .  Zacks Rank:  TEGNA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.   TEGNA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        TEGNA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      TEGNA Inc. Quote   Key Pick  Time Warner Inc. TWX  from the broader industry has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.24 % and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .

Yesterday's science-fiction is becoming today's reality. Despite all the innovation, there is a single component no tech company can survive without.

Tegna, Inc. (stylized as TEGNA) is an American publicly traded broadcast, digital media and marketing services company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[1] It was created on June 29, 2015, when Gannett Company split into two publicly traded companies. Tegna comprised the more profitable broadcast television and digital media divisions of the old Gannett, while Gannett's publishing interests were spun off as a "new" company that retained the Gannett name. Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations in 38 markets, and is the largest group owner of stations affiliated with NBC and CBS and the fourth-largest group owner of stations affiliated with ABC and holds properties in digital media.

History[edit]
In June 2015, Gannett split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which would retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey – who led Gannett's newspaper group – would serve as CEO of the former company, leaving the remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Gracia Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures (a joint venture between Tegna and several other media companies) for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[2][3]
As part of the separation, the company announced that the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—a partial anagram of "Gannett".[4] The spin-out was structured so that Tegna is the legal successor to the "old" Gannett, while the "new" Gannett is legally considered a new company. The split was completed on June 29, 2015. Tegna retained "old" Gannett's stock price history, though it trades under a new ticker symbol, TGNA. The "new" Gannett inherited old Gannett's longtime ticker symbol, GCI.[5]
Tegna also retained G/O Digital, a digital marketing services brand that it launched in August 2013, and the 20 broadcast stations it acquired from Belo Corporation in December 2013 and the six stations it acquired from London Broadcasting Company in July 2014.[1][6][7]
In September 2016, Tegna announced plans to spin off Cars.com to create two independent publicly traded companies. Tegna shareholders approved an initial public offering of Cars.com as a publicly-traded spin-off in May 2017.[8][9] Shortly after, Tegna completed the spin-off of Cars.com, which now trades under a new ticker symbol, CARS.[10]
Upon the completion of the spin-off, Dave Lougee, president of Tegna Media, was named president and CEO of Tegna and joined the company’s Board of Directors. Gracia Martore, president and CEO of Tegna, retired and stepped down from the Board.[11]
Prior to the company’s completion of the spin-off of Cars.com, it was reported by DealReporter that Nexstar Media Group may be considering a bid to acquire Tegna.[12]
In June of 2017, TEGNA announced it had entered into a definitive agreement, together with the other owners of CareerBuilder, to sell CareerBuilder to an investor group led by investments funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.[13]
Assets[edit]
Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations located in 38 markets (including seven duopolies).[14] 18 of the company's stations are affiliated with NBC (including a semi-satellite of KCEN-TV and a digital subchannel of KBMT), ten are affiliated with CBS, nine are affiliated with ABC, and three are affiliated with Fox. In addition, the company owns two CW affiliates, three MyNetworkTV affiliates and one independent station.
It also provides operational services to KTTU in Tucson through shared services agreements with Tucker Operating Co.

Television Shows[edit]
In 2015, Tegna Media test-ran a limited-run informative talk show hosted by Dallas-based bishop T. D. Jakes on its owned stations in Dallas, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cleveland. The show, titled T.D. Jakes, was co-produced by Debmar-Mercury, Tegna Media, 44 Blue Productions, Jakes' own production company, TDJ Enterprises and EnLight Productions and lasted from August 17 through September 11.[16]
On December 9, Tegna greenlit the series for an entire run for the 2016–2017 broadcast season. The series debuted on September 12 on most, if not all Tegna-owned stations, as well as several large markets, including Baltimore (WMAR), Detroit (WMYD), Orlando (WFTV/WRDQ), Chicago (WCIU), San Antonio (KSAT), and San Diego (KGTV). Debmar-Mercury, however is not participating in the production run, being replaced by independent company Flow Media Partners.[17]
T.D. Jakes will be ending in September 2017.[18]

Gannett Company spun-off most of its internet media properties to Tegna.[19] When the total internet media division was part of the Gannett Company, it managed the websites for USA Today, as well as Gannett's newspaper and broadcast properties throughout the United States. It owns:

G/O Digital[20]

Other Notes:

1 KTVY, KOLD-TV and WALA-TV were acquired with Gannett's purchase of The Detroit News, but were subsequently spun off to Knight-Ridder a day later in order for Gannett to comply with the FCC's then-current limits on group ownership.
2 Owned by Sander Media, LLC, Gannett operated these stations through a shared services agreement (SSA).
3 As part of the Gannett/Belo merger, KMOV, KTVK, and KASW were transferred to Sander Media, LLC; Gannett planned to operate the stations through shared service agreements. However, on December 16, 2013, the Department of Justice ordered that the parties (Gannett, Belo and Sander) had a period of 120 days to divest KMOV to a government-approved independent third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with KSDK. On December 23, shortly after the approval and completion of the Gannett/Belo deal, Meredith Corporation announced that it would purchase KMOV, KTVK and KASW in a $407.4 million deal.[25] The KMOV sale was completed on February 28, 2014.[26] The KTVK/KASW sale was completed on June 19.[27]
4 KTTU is owned by Tucker Operating Co, LLC. Both KTTU and KMSB (owned by Sander Media, LLC) are operated through a SSA by Raycom Media CBS affiliate KOLD-TV.
5 WDAN-TV changed call letters to WICD following its sale, and in 1967 was merged with WCHU (channel 33) in Champaign into the present-day WICD on channel 15.
6 Gannett purchased the construction permit for WINR-TV and signed the station on in 1957. Because of this, WHEC-TV and WDAN-TV are the only television stations built from the ground-up by Gannett.
7 WHEC-TV's frequency was shared with WVET-TV, owned by Veterans Broadcasting, from its 1953 sign-on until 1961 when Gannett purchased full ownership of the frequency.

These cable networks were owned by Belo prior to acquisition by Gannett.

Tegna, Inc. (stylized as TEGNA) is an American publicly traded broadcast, digital media and marketing services company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[1] It was created on June 29, 2015, when Gannett Company split into two publicly traded companies. Tegna comprised the more profitable broadcast television and digital media divisions of the old Gannett, while Gannett's publishing interests were spun off as a "new" company that retained the Gannett name. Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations in 38 markets, and is the largest group owner of stations affiliated with NBC and CBS and the fourth-largest group owner of stations affiliated with ABC and holds properties in digital media.

History[edit]
In June 2015, Gannett split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which would retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey – who led Gannett's newspaper group – would serve as CEO of the former company, leaving the remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Gracia Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures (a joint venture between Tegna and several other media companies) for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[2][3]
As part of the separation, the company announced that the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—a partial anagram of "Gannett".[4] The spin-out was structured so that Tegna is the legal successor to the "old" Gannett, while the "new" Gannett is legally considered a new company. The split was completed on June 29, 2015. Tegna retained "old" Gannett's stock price history, though it trades under a new ticker symbol, TGNA. The "new" Gannett inherited old Gannett's longtime ticker symbol, GCI.[5]
Tegna also retained G/O Digital, a digital marketing services brand that it launched in August 2013, and the 20 broadcast stations it acquired from Belo Corporation in December 2013 and the six stations it acquired from London Broadcasting Company in July 2014.[1][6][7]
In September 2016, Tegna announced plans to spin off Cars.com to create two independent publicly traded companies. Tegna shareholders approved an initial public offering of Cars.com as a publicly-traded spin-off in May 2017.[8][9] Shortly after, Tegna completed the spin-off of Cars.com, which now trades under a new ticker symbol, CARS.[10]
Upon the completion of the spin-off, Dave Lougee, president of Tegna Media, was named president and CEO of Tegna and joined the company’s Board of Directors. Gracia Martore, president and CEO of Tegna, retired and stepped down from the Board.[11]
Prior to the company’s completion of the spin-off of Cars.com, it was reported by DealReporter that Nexstar Media Group may be considering a bid to acquire Tegna.[12]
In June of 2017, TEGNA announced it had entered into a definitive agreement, together with the other owners of CareerBuilder, to sell CareerBuilder to an investor group led by investments funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.[13]
Assets[edit]
Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations located in 38 markets (including seven duopolies).[14] 18 of the company's stations are affiliated with NBC (including a semi-satellite of KCEN-TV and a digital subchannel of KBMT), ten are affiliated with CBS, nine are affiliated with ABC, and three are affiliated with Fox. In addition, the company owns two CW affiliates, three MyNetworkTV affiliates and one independent station.
It also provides operational services to KTTU in Tucson through shared services agreements with Tucker Operating Co.

Television Shows[edit]
In 2015, Tegna Media test-ran a limited-run informative talk show hosted by Dallas-based bishop T. D. Jakes on its owned stations in Dallas, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cleveland. The show, titled T.D. Jakes, was co-produced by Debmar-Mercury, Tegna Media, 44 Blue Productions, Jakes' own production company, TDJ Enterprises and EnLight Productions and lasted from August 17 through September 11.[16]
On December 9, Tegna greenlit the series for an entire run for the 2016–2017 broadcast season. The series debuted on September 12 on most, if not all Tegna-owned stations, as well as several large markets, including Baltimore (WMAR), Detroit (WMYD), Orlando (WFTV/WRDQ), Chicago (WCIU), San Antonio (KSAT), and San Diego (KGTV). Debmar-Mercury, however is not participating in the production run, being replaced by independent company Flow Media Partners.[17]
T.D. Jakes will be ending in September 2017.[18]
Digital Sites[edit]
Gannett Company spun-off most of its internet media properties to Tegna.[19] When the total internet media division was part of the Gannett Company, it managed the websites for USA Today, as well as Gannett's newspaper and broadcast properties throughout the United States. It owns:

G/O Digital[20]
Premion[21]
CareerBuilder[22][a]




^ Owns 12.5% stake along with majority owners Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, as well as minority owners The McClatchy Company and Tribune Media.

Cars.com - TEGNA completed the spin-off of Cars.com on June 1, 2017.[22]
Cofactor Digital - On December 15, 2016, sold Cofactor to Liquidus, a digital marketing solutions company.[24]

Other Notes:

1 KTVY, KOLD-TV and WALA-TV were acquired with Gannett's purchase of The Detroit News, but were subsequently spun off to Knight-Ridder a day later in order for Gannett to comply with the FCC's then-current limits on group ownership.
2 Owned by Sander Media, LLC, Gannett operated these stations through a shared services agreement (SSA).
3 As part of the Gannett/Belo merger, KMOV, KTVK, and KASW were transferred to Sander Media, LLC; Gannett planned to operate the stations through shared service agreements. However, on December 16, 2013, the Department of Justice ordered that the parties (Gannett, Belo and Sander) had a period of 120 days to divest KMOV to a government-approved independent third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with KSDK. On December 23, shortly after the approval and completion of the Gannett/Belo deal, Meredith Corporation announced that it would purchase KMOV, KTVK and KASW in a $407.4 million deal.[25] The KMOV sale was completed on February 28, 2014.[26] The KTVK/KASW sale was completed on June 19.[27]
4 KTTU is owned by Tucker Operating Co, LLC. Both KTTU and KMSB (owned by Sander Media, LLC) are operated through a SSA by Raycom Media CBS affiliate KOLD-TV.
5 WDAN-TV changed call letters to WICD following its sale, and in 1967 was merged with WCHU (channel 33) in Champaign into the present-day WICD on channel 15.
6 Gannett purchased the construction permit for WINR-TV and signed the station on in 1957. Because of this, WHEC-TV and WDAN-TV are the only television stations built from the ground-up by Gannett.
7 WHEC-TV's frequency was shared with WVET-TV, owned by Veterans Broadcasting, from its 1953 sign-on until 1961 when Gannett purchased full ownership of the frequency.

These cable networks were owned by Belo prior to acquisition by Gannett.

TV broadcasting station operator, TEGNA Inc. (TGNA  -  Free Report)	 is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 1, before market opens.Last quarter, TEGNA’s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.56%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at Play                                                                                  The price performance of TEGNA has been depressing over the last six months. The stock lost 32.9%, whereas the industry gained 12% over the same time frame.The U.S. broadcast TV industry has long been grappling with declining advertising revenues and global economic volatility.  In addition, the broadcast TV industry is categorized as an intensely competitive one. TEGNA’s major competitors include CBS Corp. (CBS  -  Free Report)	, Gray Television Inc. (GTN  -  Free Report)	 and Entercom Communications Corp. (ETM). Also, TEGNA’s consistent loss in digital business might hurt its long-term operations.The media and entertainment industry is one of the rapidly changing areas in the economy. Massive technical changes in content creation, aggregation, and distribution platforms have rendered the traditional business model unprofitable. Such technological changes and their latest upgrades add to the company’s programming costs and expenses, which are likely to affect the bottom line.On the other hand, TEGNA recently sold its 40.5% stake in web portal, CareerBuilder, to an investor group led by Apollo Global Management and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board. The company expects to collect almost $250 million from this sale, which will be used to clear off existing debt. TEGNA also completed the spinoff of its auto-sales website, Cars.com, into two publicly traded companies – TEGNA and Cars.com. The decision is likely to generate more value for investors than the current stock price of the company. Both broadcast TV and digital platforms are rapidly evaluating.Earnings Whispers           Our proven model does not conclusively show that TEGNA is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: TEGNA has an Earnings ESP of -10%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 27 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: TEGNA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.TEGNA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  TEGNA Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | TEGNA Inc. QuoteKey PickTime Warner Inc. (TWX  -  Free Report)	 from the broader industry has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.24 % and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  8.21 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $1.87      Market Cap $3.29 B     Shares Outstanding 214.72 M     Public Float 213.94 M     Yield 1.82% (07/28/17)      Latest Dividend $0.07 (10/02/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 09/07/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 20.23 M     Change from Last  -4.53%      Percent of Float 9.45%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 8    7.63      Net Money Flow ($)  23.01 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
