	Rockford-based Wolverine Worldwide has appointed a veteran executive at global consumer brands to its board of directors.

Gina Boswell

	Wolverine said last week that Gina R. Boswell, 50, has been appointed to its board.

	Boswell is executive vice president of the Personal Care division of Unilever PLC/Unilever NV, a global food, personal care and household products company.

	Unilever's products are sold in more than 190 countries and include global brands such as Dove, Lipton and Hellman's.

	She also serves on the board of directors of Manpower Group.

	Previously, Boswell held numerous senior leadership positions with other global companies: Avon Products, Ford Motor Company and Estee Lauder Companies.

	Boswell was included in the 2012 "Women to Watch" by Ad Age magazine and was named an "Achiever of the Year" in 2011 by Cosmetic Executive Women.

	Boswell is a graduate of Boston University and received a master's degree in public and private management from Yale University.

Consumer “perspective”

	"Gina Boswell is a well-rounded executive with a strong global perspective on the consumer marketplace, and I and my fellow directors are exceptionally pleased to have her join the board," said Blake W. Krueger, Wolverine Worldwide chairman/CEO. "She has an impressive track record of building global brands, executing business strategy and growing market share in international markets — all significant assets to our portfolio of 16 global lifestyle brands."

	Boswell said that Wolverine Worldwide is “one of the very best footwear and lifestyle companies in the world."

	“Its portfolio contains some of today's most sought-after brands, and I could not be more pleased to join a company that has such an intent focus on design and innovation, global brand building and consumer connections," Boswell said.
