(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This report, including the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,".  Overview  Acquisition of OnTarget360 Group Inc. and Merger with American Housing REIT Inc.  Ontarget360 Group Inc. (formerly CWS Marketing & Finance Group Inc.) incorporated on December 4, 2009. On July 19, 2013, Heng Fai Enterprises, Limited, a Hong Kong company (f/k/a Xpress Group, Limited) ("Heng Fai Enterprises") purchased an aggregate of 3,279,520 shares (the "Shares") of OnTarget360 Group's common stock, representing approximately 94.9% of its issued and outstanding common stock. Of these shares, 2,693,000 shares were acquired from CFO Managed Fund I, LLC for $218,275, 138,000 shares were acquired from Howard Kaplan, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer and Director for $11,185; 153,312 shares were acquired from Metacomet Company, LLC for $12,439, 102,208 shares were acquired from GRC Ventures I, LLC for $8,282, 143,000 shares were acquired from Chris Neuert for $11,587 and 50,000 shares were acquired from Chris Guaquie for $4,051.  On July 19, 2013, the board of directors of OnTarget360 Group Inc. ("OnTarget") appointed Conn Flanigan as its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a director to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his resignation or removal. The board of directors appointed Mr. Flanigan in recognition of the importance of his abilities to assist the Company in expanding its business and the contributions he can make to its strategic direction.  Upon the appointment of Mr. Flanigan as an officer and director of the Company, Howard Kaplan resigned his positions as OnTarget's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director effective as of July 19, 2013.  On November 11, 2013, the board of directors of OnTarget appointed Mr. Fai H. Chan and Mr. Tong Wan Chan as directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their resignation or removal. The board of directors appointed Mr. Fai H. Chan and Mr. Tong Wan Chan in recognition of their abilities to assist the Company in expanding its business and the contributions they can make to its strategic direction. Neither Mr. Fai H. Chan nor Mr. Tong Wan Chan has been appointed to any board committees.  The Company is the surviving entity from its merger with OnTarget. During the time period between Heng Fai Enterprises' acquisition and December 31, 2013, the management of OnTarget. began developing its new SFR strategy and evaluating the REIT tax structure. In connection with its plan to qualify and elect to be taxed as a REIT, OnTargetre-domiciled from Delaware to Maryland, which is the most common state domicile for REITs. OnTarget also renamed itself as American Housing REIT Inc. To accomplish this re-domicile, OnTarget initiated a merger. On September 12, 2013, American Housing REIT Inc., a Maryland corporation that is wholly owned by Heng Fai Enterprises, OnTarget's 94.9% stockholder, was incorporated for the sole purpose of facilitating the Company's reincorporation in Maryland. OnTagerget's board of directors unanimously approved the adoption of a proposal that we merge into and with American Housing REIT Inc. (the "Merger"). On October 11, 2013, upon the recommendation of our board of directors, Heng Fai Enterprises, the holder of approximately 94.9% our outstanding common stock and voting power, signed a written consent approving the Merger. As a result, the Merger has been approved and neither a meeting of our stockholders nor additional written consents was necessary.  Financing Arrangement  Since July 19, 2013, the Company has been financed by Heng Fai Enterprises, its majority shareholder. Subsequent to September 30, 2013, Heng Fai Enterprises loaned the Company $5,275,000 to acquire 37 SFRs and another $498,935 to acquire five SFRs. Additionally, Heng Fai Enterprises has loaned the Company funds to pay the Company's third-party professionals. All of these loans carry zero interest and have an indefinite term, but are callable by Heng Fai Enterprises at any time.  Subsequently, from November 2013 through March, 2014, we borrowed from Heng Fai Enterprises an aggregate of $7,255,649 (the "HFE Loan"). We have used $6,100,435 of the HFE Loan to acquire single family homes and for corporate operations leaving a balance of $1,155,214 currently held in escrow for future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The HFE Loan is unsecured, due on demand, and bears no interest. On April 14, 2014 we agreed with Heng Fai to convert $3,050,218 of the HFE Loan and issue an unsecured promissory note bearing interest at the rate of 4.0% per annum effective as of January 1, 2014, payable on demand, but no later than March 1, 2019, and treat $3,050,217 of the HFE Loan as a contribution to our capital and agreed to issue 37,633,775 shares of our unregistered common stock to Heng Fai at a conversion price of $0.08105 per share. As we use additional amounts of the HFE Loan in the future for acquisitions or working capital purposes, such amounts will be treated one-half as a loan and one-half as a contribution to our capital on the same terms as the April 14, 2014 conversion discussed above. Shares of our unregistered common stock issued to Heng Fai as a result of these conversions will be subject to customary anti-dilution rights in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar corporate events.  Although the Company remains reliant on Heng Fai Enterprises for capital, the Company expects to seek third party financing in 2014. We currently have no agreements to obtain loans or lines of credit through any third parties. The inability to raise funds through third parties may negatively impact our company.  We are externally managed and advised by Inter-American Management Corporation (the "Advisor") and the leasing, managing, and advertising of our properties is overseen and directed by various third-party property managers.  Although the Company remains reliant on Heng Fai Enterprises for capital, the Company expects to seek third party financing in 2014. We currently have no agreements to obtain loans or lines of credit through any third parties. The inability to raise funds through third parties may negatively impact our company.  As of December 31, 2013, we owned 30 properties in Texas with an aggregate investment of $3,962,479. We are currently evaluating new markets to identify investment opportunities that we believe can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. There is no assurance that we will close on the properties we have under contract.  Strategy  Our primary business strategy is to acquire, lease and manage single-family homes as well-maintained investment properties to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. We employ a disciplined and focused approach to evaluating acquisition opportunities, considering the mix of rent yield and future home price appreciation potential when selecting a market and investment. Our strategic aggregation of single-family homes provides a strong foundation for creating long-term home price appreciation in our portfolio. We believe our founders' years of experience in the single-family rental sector provides us with the expertise to successfully execute our business strategy nationally to institutional standards. We are building the infrastructure to acquire large numbers of properties through multiple acquisition channels. We source individual properties through wholesalers, aggregators, and brokers, and portfolios of properties through brokerages or directly from operators, investors or banks, and, in the future, we may source assets from these channels and government-sponsored entities, or GSEs. We generally source homes that are in "rent-ready" condition to a standard that we believe appeals to our target tenants' preferences, enabling us to attract qualified tenants and to provide a high level of service to retain our tenants. We plan to continue acquiring single-family homes in markets that satisfy our investment criteria.  We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Assuming that we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income taxes to the extent that we distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our stockholders and meet other specific requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates, and we may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes, and our TRS, which is our taxable REIT subsidiary, will be subject to federal, state and local taxes on its income at regular corporate rates.

Highlights of Third Quarter of 2013  Acquisitions  Factors Expected to Affect Our Results and Financial Condition Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include our pace of acquisitions and ability to deploy our capital, the amount of time and cost required to stabilize newly acquired properties and convert them to revenue generating assets, rental rates, occupancy levels, rates of tenant turnover, our expense ratios and capital structure.  Property Acquisitions  The acquisition of properties involves the expenditure of capital in addition to payment of the purchase price, including payments for property inspections, closing costs, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, property taxes, HOA fees (when applicable) and restoration costs.  Revenue  In each of our markets, we monitor a number of factors that may impact the single-family real estate market and our tenants' finances, including the unemployment rate, household formation and net population growth, income growth, size and make-up of existing and anticipated housing stock, prevailing market rental and mortgage rates, rental vacancies and credit availability. Growth in demand for rental housing in excess of the growth of rental housing supply, among other factors, will generally drive higher occupancy and rental rates. Negative trends in our markets with respect to these metrics or others could adversely impact our rental revenue.  The growth of our portfolio has been initiated in recent months, as we have commenced acquiring properties in Texas. We are actively identifying other markets in which to invest.  Expenses  Property-Related Expenses  Property Management  Overhead  Based on our experience, we believe that the property-related expenses for vacancy, bad debt, property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, repairs and maintenance and capital expenditure reserves and the costs for property management services, such as managing the process of restoring, marketing, leasing and maintaining our stabilized single-family homes, will average a significant amount of gross rental revenue. Variations in asset level returns will be due to a variety of factors, including location, age and condition of the property and the efficiency of our property management services.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2013  We believe our financial results during the three months ended December 31, 2013 are not representative of our future financial results as this was the initial period of our SFR operations. We will be experiencing rapid growth since the commencement of our investment activities. We also have not included discussion of our discontinued marketing operation in the previous period ending December 31, 2012.  Rental Revenue  Property Operating and Maintenance  Real Estate Taxes  Homeowners' Association Fees  Depreciation and Amortization  General and Administrative  General and administrative expense include additional costs such as increased legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance, SEC reporting and other compliance matters.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. For a discussion of recently-issued and adopted accounting standards, see "Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements, Note 2-Significant accounting policies."  Investment in Real Estate  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Leasing Costs  Depreciation and Amortization  Revenue and Expense Recognition  Income Taxes  We plan on electing to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning in 2014. REITs are generally not be subject to federal income taxes if the Company can meet many specific requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates, and we may be ineligible to qualify as a REIT for subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes, and if we create a Taxable REIT Subsidiary ("TRS"), the TRS will be subject to federal, state and local taxes on its income at regular corporate rates.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations and make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our near-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of purchasing our target assets, restoring and leasing properties and funding our operations.  Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition and maintenance of properties; HOA fees; real estate taxes; non-recurring capital expenditures; interest and principal payments should we incur indebtedness; payment of quarterly distributions to our stockholders to the extent declared by our Board of Directors; and general and administrative expenses. On homes that are currently leased, we expect to incur between $1,500 to $2,500 in retenancy costs on average, in order to prepare the home for rent . . .

1:57 AM  Impact on the Local Housing Markets When the Aggregators Come to Town 


                            • Price rises… How much? How much of the increase on prices is due to actual economic recovery or funds competing for very few properties in market • As the supply of rentals increases is the price remaining steady? • Are mini bubbles forming? • Long term exits…What will happen when everyone looks to sell at the same time? Will everyone sell? When will they sell? • Do aggregators mostly buy through auctions? Does this result in prices being bid up for this channel? How does this impact other channels? • Is there still a foreclosure discount or REO Haircut

Our Mission

 


By breathing new life into neglected multifamily properties, we plan to generate positive returns for our investors, while improving the quality of life for residents and surrounding communities.
 
At Impact Housing, our top priority is to have happy residents, who stay and pay (and refer their friends), which in turn, results in happy managers and happy investors.  To this end, we measure rate of return two ways—profits and impact. We earn profits from the impact investing in housing has on people’s lives and on resident retention. It’s a true symbiotic relationship.

“We love swimming and grilling outdoors with our neighbors and especially enjoy working in the community garden. Glen Rock Landing has a great family environment we are proud to be a part of.” 
Samantha Williams, Resident of Glen Rock Landing, Maryland


 



“When they took this place over it was a mess…now it looks great.
The management is very nice too.”  
Ronika Gouthia, Resident of Central Park Apartments, Arlington, TX

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
