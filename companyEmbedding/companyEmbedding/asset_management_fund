Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

                Lead The Charge With Product Development            


    By Christina Granville 






Share















































The area of product development is an important one in financial services and it is specifically crucial when it comes to investment management. Determining what asset management fund products will be released, in what countries and at which times are pivotal decisions for any firm. Those in product development are often the ones who make to the final decision on which asset management products their investors will have to choose from and their pricing structure. If you've got your ear to the floor regarding what's new and what could be a big hit, then this may be the career for you.
The Role of Product Development In seeking to launch new products, those in the product development department often search for gaps in the product lines. When a new fund is in the process of being established, those in product development work with the legal and compliance teams to make sure the investment vehicle meets all regulatory and legal requirements. They also work closely with the marketing and sales departments to craft the promotional material for the new investment product. (For more on this process, read On The Record: Communications With The Public.)
The product development team also plays a role in assessing competitors' products. This allows the team to ensure that their firm's products are adequately positioned to compete effectively. As a result of their competitive intelligence, they will often make recommendations when it comes to merging or eliminating funds, and setting the pricing of funds. (Keep reading on this subject in Where do most fund managers get their market information?)
Product Development: What It TakesWhile staffers in product development often have experience in other areas of investment management, entry-level positions do open up from time to time depending on the company. If you are an undergraduate student considering a career in investment management product development, you might want to consider taking courses in economics, accounting, math and marketing. A graduate MBA degree is always looked favorably upon by investment management firms. Even if you don't have an MBA, however, enrolling in the CFA or the CAIA programs may also be helpful.
The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program, offered by the CFA Institute, consists of three levels of tests that you can study for independently. Passing all three levels, in addition to gaining four years of eligible work experience and completing a professional conduct statement, will earn you the CFA charter. Because this charter is so hard to earn, it is a highly regarded emblem of knowledge within the investment community. (To read more on obtaining the CFA Charter, see Pass Your CFA Exams The First Time and So, You Want To Earn Your CFA?)
The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) program offers a curriculum focused on alternative investments. The specialized CAIA program has two levels of exams that cover hedge fund and private equity investment products as well as real estate, managed futures and commodity products. The CAIA designation is conferred by the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association upon those who complete the program and have at least one year of professional experience. 
Developing Offshore ProductsEither the CFA or the CAIA designations could be of great value within an offshore product development department. Offshore product development focuses on the launch, sale and marketing of funds off the domestic shore of the United States. Legal regulations vary considerably in different countries and offshore product development staffers must work carefully with legal and compliance departments to make certain that the funds are compliant for each country in which they are issued. Sales and marketing approaches must also be tweaked depending upon the country in which the investment vehicle is issued - especially when a particular country has important cultural traits to consider when determining successful marketing and sales strategies. 
Some staffers within product development choose to specialize in offshore marketing due to these compelling challenges. However, when you are first hired with a product development department, you will generally learn the ropes of domestic product marketing - or the practice of developing fund products sold within the confines of the United States - before moving on to offshore investment vehicles. (For related reading, see Pros And Cons Of Offshore Investing.)
What To Expect A day in the life of a product development staffer is varied, complex and incredibly up to date. As with most in the investment fields, those in product development tend to start the day by reading The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, watching CNBC and financial news shows, and perusing online forums and sites that discuss current financial events and developments.
A member of a product development staff may have an early morning meeting with the legal department in order to go over the prospectus for the launch of a new fund. Right after that meeting, there may be a similar gathering within the compliance department in order to go over compliance issues with that same fund that is due to launch in the near future.
Over lunch, the product development department may informally eat together in order to compare notes and discuss the latest developments on fund launches. The afternoon may bring meetings with the sales and marketing departments in order to discuss another investment vehicle that has recently launched. Topics might be on the collateral required to sell the fund, or briefing the sales force on the best way to position the sale of the fund with potential investors.
Finally, before the staffer heads home that day, he or she may pour over competitor pricing data in order to consider a pricing strategy for a new fund product about to launch. Some of these reports may find their way into the staffer's briefcase to continue to assess over dinner or at home.
Pursuing the Product Development DreamProduct development is a challenging - but ultimately rewarding - career path within an investment management firm. Those in product development have their fingers on the pulse of exciting new fund launches and are integral in developing the strategies behind new products. If you like the idea of being at the center of this storm, you might want to consider a career in product development.
If you're not interested in product development, but would like to still pursue a financial career, see Finding Your Place In The Financial Industry.

Asset Management - Product & Fund Delivery Manager - Associate

Req #: 170065843
Location:


Senningerberg, 
		L,
                LU

Job Category: Asset Management
Potential Referral Amount: 4000 Euro (EUR)


JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a leading global financial services firm with assets of more than $2.4 trillion, over 240,000 employees and operations in over 60 countries. It operates across four business segments including Asset & Wealth Management, Corporate and Investment Banking, Commercial Banking and Consumer and Community Banking. 

J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management is made up of the Asset Management and Wealth Management

 
The Team 
Luxembourg Product & Fund Delivery is the centre of expertise and knowledge for implementation of any fund initiatives in the JPMorgan Asset Management Luxembourg proprietary fund range: new fund and share class launches, liquidations, mergers, enhancements to existing funds, local coordination all affected stakeholders in Luxembourg. We operate in partnership with the investment managers and our core focus is on those activities performed in Luxembourg: Transfer Agency, Fund Accounting, Custody, Management Company, Audit, and general oversight of delegated matters with Luxembourg stakeholders. The team is made of experienced product & project managers.
 
Main Responsibilities & Duties

The primary responsibility will be the efficient project management of initiatives that seek to deliver new products or enhance the existing product range. The typical type of product initiatives managed by the team are: investment fund launches, liquidations, mergers, any changes/enhancements to existing products, manage the implementation of any changes driven by prospectus updates and regulations, share class activations on behalf of Sales and Distribution.

Typically, new product initiatives follow several phases: i) idea generation, ii) pre-scoping, iii) scoping, iv) implementation, v) hand over to teams in Operations Dpt and vi) go live or execution.

Example of project: launch of the JPMorgan China A-Share Opportunities Fund: 


The product delivery manager will have various degrees of involvement in the phases ii) to vi).

A complex product such as this fund will require the product delivery manager to feed the Product Development team with critical operational information that is required during the pre-scoping and scoping phases i.e. can the new product idea be supported by the operational teams and if not, what are the initial solutions envisaged to make it happen.

Fund Structuring and Product Development in Asset Management







Duration:2 days

Location:Prague, NH Hotel Prague




The Process of Idea Generation in Asset Management
How to Identify Global Economic and Regulatory Trends? 
Structuring and Developing of Investment Products
Underlying, Payoff and Investment Style
Fund Set-up, Fund Administration and Maintenance
Distribution, Service Providers and Transfer Agents
Regulatory Constraints in Asset Management
How Regulation Impact the Structuring of New Products?


Workshop Objectives
The purpose of this workshop is for participants to learn about the art of Product Development in Asset Management. Product Development is a multi-disciplinary activity and requires different skills from different areas. A project manager is in the crossroads of all departments within Fund Management Companies (sales, compliance, legal, risk, investment teams, operational teams etc.) and needs to acquire a general understanding of the different constraints of all these teams. His objectives are (1) to identify client needs and provide investment ideas for the origination of new products and (2) manage the project from A to Z making sure that all parameters from the different teams have been optimised. This workshop will provide a detailed analysis of what a product manager should take into account in his activity of product origination.

Key Points
There are two keys aspects that must be taken into account when originating a new investment product. The first one is what we could call its "economic substance" which would need to meet the client needs, obligation and financial constraints. The second one is what we could call the "legal substance" or the "regulatory format" (also called the wrapping) of the product that must be structured in a way to optimise legal and regulatory cost. This workshop will emphasizes these two main points by providing concrete and detailed materials.

Who should attend?

Product Managers and Fund structurers that are in charge of developing new projects in the field of Asset Management Companies 
 Product Managers (or team members) dedicated to specific teams (compliance team, legal team, operational team, risk team, marketing team etc.) that take part in development and origination project.
Methodology
The workshop is taught using both theoretical theory and practical and interactive case studies. Economic structuring will require the use of Excel to price financial instruments that are used to match more precisely the client needs. Regulatory structuring will require the study of the regulation in detail and its application through detailed key study. Excel may be used for this purpose as well.





 09.00 - 09.15 Welcome and Introduction 09.15 - 10.00 The process of Idea               Generation In this chapter we will talk about methodology for idea               generation in Asset Management. While a bottom-up approach is the               main approach used (sales or client feedback, market watch etc.),               a top-down approach may sometime provide a competitive advantage               for product managers. For this, he/she will need to identify               global economic and regulatory trends (emergence of a new sector,               change of policies, new regulation impacting some clients etc.)               that may impact your clients. The objective is to anticipate their               future needs and offer customised and tailored solution. Different practical case will be provided using my personal               experience as Fund Structurer such as (1) Multi-Asset Income Fund               or Auto-Call payoff in formula fund or High Yield ETFs for retail               clients in a context of a low yield environment and (2) providing               more transparency on Hedge Funds to Insurance Companies in a               context of Solvency II implementation. 10.15 - 13.00 Underlying, Payoff and               Investment Style The second phase of product development is the actual economic               structuring of the project. Three aspects must be taken into               account carefully.   One is the underlying, or the asset class that will                 ultimately deliver the performance of the product.  Second is the payoff. The idea is to use specific financial                 instruments or management technics to modify the risk profile of                 an underlying to match in more details the needs of the client.                 We will study how the use of options and insurance portfolio                 technics can achieve this objective.   Different study case and Excel exercise will be done to see               how these technics can modify the economic profile of a product.    Third is the Investment Style: Will the product be managed                 actively by an asset manager or use passive management technics                 to achieve more transparencies?  13.00 - 14.00 Lunch 14.00 - 17.00 Fund Set-up, Fund               Administration & Maintenance, Distribution and Service Providers Approval process and pass-porting will be detailed in this               section. UCITS directive and AIFM directive propose the               possibility to passport funds in Europe. This process will be               developed. During the life of a Fund, terms and condition may               change which lead to an amendment of the prospectus and other key               materials. This process is submitted to specific rules and               condition that will be detailed.    A mapping of all the different service providers will be               developed with a specific focus on the administrator in charge of               the NAV calculation and the accounting of investment funds, the               transfer agent in charge of the reception, centralisation,               aggregations of subscription-redemption and the holding of               registers, and the distributor in charge of dealing with the end-client               directly. In this respect, liquidity and subscription / redemption               schedule need careful attention to ensure equal treatment of unit-holders.               They will depend on the liquidity of the underlying but also on               the operational organisation of all different service providers. We will also focus on some operational aspects that need               careful attention such as Fees (we will here develop the different               type of fees and their calculation methods (ongoing fees, up-front               fees, performance fees etc.), the structure of class of shares,               structure of sub-funds within Umbrella structures, master-feeder               etc. Day Two This second day will focus on regulatory constraints which               will impact how investment products are structured. In the first               part of this second day, we will present the current regulatory               framework in asset management in Europe and we will focus on the               rules that significantly impact the structure of funds. This first               chapter will help to understand what will follow in the second               chapter. In this second chapter, we will focus on the impact of               regulation on the global structure of the investment product and               on the rationales that determine the optimal wrapper for a new               investment product. 08.30 - 12.00 Regulation in Asset               Management In this section, we will discuss where we stand in terms of               regulation in Europe. UCITS remains the main regulatory framework               in Europe for retail funds. This regulation will be presented and               the main changes from UCITS I to UCITS V will be highlighted as               well as the discussed topics toward UCITS VI. More specifically,               we will concentrate on the rules that significantly impact the               structure of funds. For example, the way leverage limits are               measure, eligibility of assets and indices are defined shape the               way funds are originated. In this chapter, many different practical cases will be used               using Excel to illustrate how investment restrictions are applied               in practice, for example, the way leverage is calculated and the               way diversification requirement is measured. 12.00 - 12.45 Lunch 12.45 - 14.00 How Regulation               Impact the Structuring of New Products In this section, we will discuss how regulation will impact the               whole structure of an investment product. Structure of ETFs,               Newcits, formula funds and structured funds highly depend on               investment restrictions within the UCITS framework. Index strategy,               Smart Beta index (which are often sold through UCITS structure)               are shaped by those regulatory constraints.  Fund structuring will also depend on tax consideration which               will determine the type of instruments that needs to be used. 14.15 - 15.45 Determination of the               Optimal Legal Wrapper Finally, the choice of the legal wrapper is another important               part of product management. Sophisticated Fund Managers have               usually different options (Lux Funds (UCITS or not), Irish funds (UCITS               or not), contractual funds, Cayman funds, Jersey funds, Mauritius               funds etc.). In this chapter, we will study the parameters that               need to be taken into account when deciding which wrapper must be               used. Clients profile and their restrictions must be taken into               account as well as the global pricing of the structure. We will               elaborate on what makes the pricing of the different wrappers and               provide some estimates about their levels. Evaluation and Termination of the Seminar

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
