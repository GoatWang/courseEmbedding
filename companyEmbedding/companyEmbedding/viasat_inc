History[edit]
Early history (1986-2004)[edit]
ViaSat was co-founded in May 1986 by Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and Steve Hart.[11][12][13] Mark Dankberg became chief executive officer and Mark Miller and Steve Hart became chief technical officers.[12] ViaSat received venture capital financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.[12][13] In December of 1996, ViaSat had its initial public offering(IPO).[12][11] The company offered $20 million in stock to the public, leaving the founders with 28 percent of the company and venture capital backers with 20 percent.[14]
The acquisition of the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta for $75 million in cash in 2000 helped ViaSat to focus on providing technology for interactive services to businesses.[15] ViaSat launched a spin-off company, TrellisWare Technology, in 2000. The self-funded company focuses on solutions for ground communications problems.[16][17]
In 2001, ViaSat started working with Boeing on Connexion broadband for airliners.[11] The company acquired Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications' products unit, Comsat Laboratories in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.[12][18][19] Comsat Laboratories is ViaSat's technology and product development group for communication systems focusing on developing new technologies for extremely bandwidth efficient, high data rate satellite transmission.[18][19][20] In 2001, ViaSat also purchased US Monolithics, a company focused on designing high frequency broadband circuitry, for around $30 million.[12][21][22] ViaSat won a contract with WildBlue Communications worth $16 million in March 2001 to build WildBlue's satellite modems to support the company’s initial service launch.[23] WildBlue signed a second contract with ViaSat in 2001 for $17 million and ViaSat would develop and produce satellite modem termination systems for six gateway stations.[24] Eutelsat entered an agreement in 2001 to use ViaSat’s LinkStar high performance IP terminals for their broadband multimedia network over Ku-based FSS satellites.[25] ViaSat entered a joint venture in 2001 with Loral Skynet to found Immeon Networks to develop the Immeon satellite bandwidth-on-demand service sold in monthly managed service plans. ABC News used Immeon to improve its voice and data-communications for on-location news.[26]
2005-present[edit]
WildBlue launched its internet service in October 2004 after gaining Ka-band transponder capacity on the Telesat Anik F2 satellite. It conducted formal technical testing until January 2005, followed by nationwide beta testing before the first residential retail customers had services installed in June.[27] The WildBlue service was upgraded in 2007 using the satellite WildBlue-1, which launched the year before.[28][29]
In 2005, ViaSat acquired Efficient Channel Coding, a producer of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems, which gave ViaSat access to the IPStar satellite broadband market.[30][13] Enerdyne, a defense technology firm, was acquired by ViaSat in 2006 for an initial investment of $17 million adding its EnerLinks II video data link equipment to ViaSat’s defense products.[31][13]
ViaSat acquired JAST Antenna Systems, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2007. JAST develops microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and mobile satellite applications.[32]
In December 2009, ViaSat bought WildBlue, based in Colorado, for $568 million in cash and stock.[33] ViaSat issued 4.3 million shares for the stock component of the purchase.[3] The United States Government granted stimulus funding to WildBlue to expand broadband coverage in rural areas.[34][35][36]
In 2010, ViaSat bought Stonewood Group of Dorset, England, an encryption company, for $20 million in cash and stock.[37]
In 2013, ViaSat contributed $1 million to University of California, San Diego's Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.[12] In January 2013, ViaSat broke ground for its expansion in Duluth, Georgia. The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014. Focused on government and enterprise customers, NetNearU has a wifi management system called TRACKOS, a cloud-based software.[7][8][9]
On June 1, 2017, ViaSat's $624 million Internet satellite, ViaSat-2, was launched. The launch was originally scheduled for April 25, 2017, but was delayed due to the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana.[47][48]
Satellites[edit]
ViaSat has three satellites, ViaSat-1, WildBlue1, and Anik-F2.[49] It purchased WildBlue in 2009, which had 2 satellites and 400,000 customers.[11] Space Systems/Loral built ViaSat-1 and it launched from Kazakhstan in October 2011 and entered service in January 2012.[11][33][12] ViaSat-1 can handle about 1 million users, and covers the residential US with additional coverage in Hawaii, Canada and Alaska through a Ka-band connection.[11]
ViaSat-1 runs on fixed beams trained on certain geographic areas and that will be expanded with the launch of ViaSat-2.[50] ViaSat-2 is under construction and due to launch in June 2017.[10] ViaSat has partnered with Boeing to build the satellite.[51] The coverage area will include Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, parts of northern South America and aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean.[51][11]
In November 2015, ViaSat announced that it was planning to order the first of three ViaSat-3 Ka-band satellites that would expand coverage globally with throughput capacity of one terabit per second for each of the satellites.[52]
Exede Internet[edit]
Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
Early history (1986-2004)[edit]
ViaSat was co-founded in May 1986 by Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and Steve Hart.[11][12][13] Mark Dankberg became chief executive officer and Mark Miller and Steve Hart became chief technical officers.[12] ViaSat received venture capital financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.[12][13] In December of 1996, ViaSat had its initial public offering(IPO).[12][11] The company offered $20 million in stock to the public, leaving the founders with 28 percent of the company and venture capital backers with 20 percent.[14]
The acquisition of the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta for $75 million in cash in 2000 helped ViaSat to focus on providing technology for interactive services to businesses.[15] ViaSat launched a spin-off company, TrellisWare Technology, in 2000. The self-funded company focuses on solutions for ground communications problems.[16][17]
In 2001, ViaSat started working with Boeing on Connexion broadband for airliners.[11] The company acquired Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications' products unit, Comsat Laboratories in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.[12][18][19] Comsat Laboratories is ViaSat's technology and product development group for communication systems focusing on developing new technologies for extremely bandwidth efficient, high data rate satellite transmission.[18][19][20] In 2001, ViaSat also purchased US Monolithics, a company focused on designing high frequency broadband circuitry, for around $30 million.[12][21][22] ViaSat won a contract with WildBlue Communications worth $16 million in March 2001 to build WildBlue's satellite modems to support the company’s initial service launch.[23] WildBlue signed a second contract with ViaSat in 2001 for $17 million and ViaSat would develop and produce satellite modem termination systems for six gateway stations.[24] Eutelsat entered an agreement in 2001 to use ViaSat’s LinkStar high performance IP terminals for their broadband multimedia network over Ku-based FSS satellites.[25] ViaSat entered a joint venture in 2001 with Loral Skynet to found Immeon Networks to develop the Immeon satellite bandwidth-on-demand service sold in monthly managed service plans. ABC News used Immeon to improve its voice and data-communications for on-location news.[26]
2005-present[edit]
WildBlue launched its internet service in October 2004 after gaining Ka-band transponder capacity on the Telesat Anik F2 satellite. It conducted formal technical testing until January 2005, followed by nationwide beta testing before the first residential retail customers had services installed in June.[27] The WildBlue service was upgraded in 2007 using the satellite WildBlue-1, which launched the year before.[28][29]
In 2005, ViaSat acquired Efficient Channel Coding, a producer of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems, which gave ViaSat access to the IPStar satellite broadband market.[30][13] Enerdyne, a defense technology firm, was acquired by ViaSat in 2006 for an initial investment of $17 million adding its EnerLinks II video data link equipment to ViaSat’s defense products.[31][13]
ViaSat acquired JAST Antenna Systems, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2007. JAST develops microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and mobile satellite applications.[32]
In December 2009, ViaSat bought WildBlue, based in Colorado, for $568 million in cash and stock.[33] ViaSat issued 4.3 million shares for the stock component of the purchase.[3] The United States Government granted stimulus funding to WildBlue to expand broadband coverage in rural areas.[34][35][36]
In 2010, ViaSat bought Stonewood Group of Dorset, England, an encryption company, for $20 million in cash and stock.[37]
In 2013, ViaSat contributed $1 million to University of California, San Diego's Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.[12] In January 2013, ViaSat broke ground for its expansion in Duluth, Georgia. The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014. Focused on government and enterprise customers, NetNearU has a wifi management system called TRACKOS, a cloud-based software.[7][8][9]
On June 1, 2017, ViaSat's $624 million Internet satellite, ViaSat-2, was launched. The launch was originally scheduled for April 25, 2017, but was delayed due to the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana.[47][48]
Satellites[edit]
ViaSat has three satellites, ViaSat-1, WildBlue1, and Anik-F2.[49] It purchased WildBlue in 2009, which had 2 satellites and 400,000 customers.[11] Space Systems/Loral built ViaSat-1 and it launched from Kazakhstan in October 2011 and entered service in January 2012.[11][33][12] ViaSat-1 can handle about 1 million users, and covers the residential US with additional coverage in Hawaii, Canada and Alaska through a Ka-band connection.[11]
ViaSat-1 runs on fixed beams trained on certain geographic areas and that will be expanded with the launch of ViaSat-2.[50] ViaSat-2 is under construction and due to launch in June 2017.[10] ViaSat has partnered with Boeing to build the satellite.[51] The coverage area will include Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, parts of northern South America and aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean.[51][11]
In November 2015, ViaSat announced that it was planning to order the first of three ViaSat-3 Ka-band satellites that would expand coverage globally with throughput capacity of one terabit per second for each of the satellites.[52]
Exede Internet[edit]
Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

History[edit]
Early history (1986-2004)[edit]
ViaSat was co-founded in May 1986 by Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and Steve Hart.[11][12][13] Mark Dankberg became chief executive officer and Mark Miller and Steve Hart became chief technical officers.[12] ViaSat received venture capital financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.[12][13] In December of 1996, ViaSat had its initial public offering(IPO).[12][11] The company offered $20 million in stock to the public, leaving the founders with 28 percent of the company and venture capital backers with 20 percent.[14]
The acquisition of the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta for $75 million in cash in 2000 helped ViaSat to focus on providing technology for interactive services to businesses.[15] ViaSat launched a spin-off company, TrellisWare Technology, in 2000. The self-funded company focuses on solutions for ground communications problems.[16][17]
In 2001, ViaSat started working with Boeing on Connexion broadband for airliners.[11] The company acquired Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications' products unit, Comsat Laboratories in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.[12][18][19] Comsat Laboratories is ViaSat's technology and product development group for communication systems focusing on developing new technologies for extremely bandwidth efficient, high data rate satellite transmission.[18][19][20] In 2001, ViaSat also purchased US Monolithics, a company focused on designing high frequency broadband circuitry, for around $30 million.[12][21][22] ViaSat won a contract with WildBlue Communications worth $16 million in March 2001 to build WildBlue's satellite modems to support the company’s initial service launch.[23] WildBlue signed a second contract with ViaSat in 2001 for $17 million and ViaSat would develop and produce satellite modem termination systems for six gateway stations.[24] Eutelsat entered an agreement in 2001 to use ViaSat’s LinkStar high performance IP terminals for their broadband multimedia network over Ku-based FSS satellites.[25] ViaSat entered a joint venture in 2001 with Loral Skynet to found Immeon Networks to develop the Immeon satellite bandwidth-on-demand service sold in monthly managed service plans. ABC News used Immeon to improve its voice and data-communications for on-location news.[26]
2005-present[edit]
WildBlue launched its internet service in October 2004 after gaining Ka-band transponder capacity on the Telesat Anik F2 satellite. It conducted formal technical testing until January 2005, followed by nationwide beta testing before the first residential retail customers had services installed in June.[27] The WildBlue service was upgraded in 2007 using the satellite WildBlue-1, which launched the year before.[28][29]
In 2005, ViaSat acquired Efficient Channel Coding, a producer of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems, which gave ViaSat access to the IPStar satellite broadband market.[30][13] Enerdyne, a defense technology firm, was acquired by ViaSat in 2006 for an initial investment of $17 million adding its EnerLinks II video data link equipment to ViaSat’s defense products.[31][13]
ViaSat acquired JAST Antenna Systems, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2007. JAST develops microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and mobile satellite applications.[32]
In December 2009, ViaSat bought WildBlue, based in Colorado, for $568 million in cash and stock.[33] ViaSat issued 4.3 million shares for the stock component of the purchase.[3] The United States Government granted stimulus funding to WildBlue to expand broadband coverage in rural areas.[34][35][36]
In 2010, ViaSat bought Stonewood Group of Dorset, England, an encryption company, for $20 million in cash and stock.[37]
In 2013, ViaSat contributed $1 million to University of California, San Diego's Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.[12] In January 2013, ViaSat broke ground for its expansion in Duluth, Georgia. The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014.

History[edit]
Early history (1986-2004)[edit]
ViaSat was co-founded in May 1986 by Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and Steve Hart.[11][12][13] Mark Dankberg became chief executive officer and Mark Miller and Steve Hart became chief technical officers.[12] ViaSat received venture capital financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.[12][13] In December of 1996, ViaSat had its initial public offering(IPO).[12][11] The company offered $20 million in stock to the public, leaving the founders with 28 percent of the company and venture capital backers with 20 percent.[14]
The acquisition of the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta for $75 million in cash in 2000 helped ViaSat to focus on providing technology for interactive services to businesses.[15] ViaSat launched a spin-off company, TrellisWare Technology, in 2000. The self-funded company focuses on solutions for ground communications problems.[16][17]
In 2001, ViaSat started working with Boeing on Connexion broadband for airliners.[11] The company acquired Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications' products unit, Comsat Laboratories in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.[12][18][19] Comsat Laboratories is ViaSat's technology and product development group for communication systems focusing on developing new technologies for extremely bandwidth efficient, high data rate satellite transmission.[18][19][20] In 2001, ViaSat also purchased US Monolithics, a company focused on designing high frequency broadband circuitry, for around $30 million.[12][21][22] ViaSat won a contract with WildBlue Communications worth $16 million in March 2001 to build WildBlue's satellite modems to support the company’s initial service launch.[23] WildBlue signed a second contract with ViaSat in 2001 for $17 million and ViaSat would develop and produce satellite modem termination systems for six gateway stations.[24] Eutelsat entered an agreement in 2001 to use ViaSat’s LinkStar high performance IP terminals for their broadband multimedia network over Ku-based FSS satellites.[25] ViaSat entered a joint venture in 2001 with Loral Skynet to found Immeon Networks to develop the Immeon satellite bandwidth-on-demand service sold in monthly managed service plans. ABC News used Immeon to improve its voice and data-communications for on-location news.[26]
2005-present[edit]
WildBlue launched its internet service in October 2004 after gaining Ka-band transponder capacity on the Telesat Anik F2 satellite. It conducted formal technical testing until January 2005, followed by nationwide beta testing before the first residential retail customers had services installed in June.[27] The WildBlue service was upgraded in 2007 using the satellite WildBlue-1, which launched the year before.[28][29]
In 2005, ViaSat acquired Efficient Channel Coding, a producer of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems, which gave ViaSat access to the IPStar satellite broadband market.[30][13] Enerdyne, a defense technology firm, was acquired by ViaSat in 2006 for an initial investment of $17 million adding its EnerLinks II video data link equipment to ViaSat’s defense products.[31][13]
ViaSat acquired JAST Antenna Systems, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2007. JAST develops microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and mobile satellite applications.[32]
In December 2009, ViaSat bought WildBlue, based in Colorado, for $568 million in cash and stock.[33] ViaSat issued 4.3 million shares for the stock component of the purchase.[3] The United States Government granted stimulus funding to WildBlue to expand broadband coverage in rural areas.[34][35][36]
In 2010, ViaSat bought Stonewood Group of Dorset, England, an encryption company, for $20 million in cash and stock.[37]
In 2013, ViaSat contributed $1 million to University of California, San Diego's Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.[12] In January 2013, ViaSat broke ground for its expansion in Duluth, Georgia. The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014. Focused on government and enterprise customers, NetNearU has a wifi management system called TRACKOS, a cloud-based software.[7][8][9]
On June 1, 2017, ViaSat's $624 million Internet satellite, ViaSat-2, was launched. The launch was originally scheduled for April 25, 2017, but was delayed due to the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana.[47][48]
Satellites[edit]
ViaSat has three satellites, ViaSat-1, WildBlue1, and Anik-F2.[49] It purchased WildBlue in 2009, which had 2 satellites and 400,000 customers.[11] Space Systems/Loral built ViaSat-1 and it launched from Kazakhstan in October 2011 and entered service in January 2012.[11][33][12] ViaSat-1 can handle about 1 million users, and covers the residential US with additional coverage in Hawaii, Canada and Alaska through a Ka-band connection.[11]
ViaSat-1 runs on fixed beams trained on certain geographic areas and that will be expanded with the launch of ViaSat-2.[50] ViaSat-2 is under construction and due to launch in June 2017.[10] ViaSat has partnered with Boeing to build the satellite.[51] The coverage area will include Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, parts of northern South America and aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean.[51][11]
In November 2015, ViaSat announced that it was planning to order the first of three ViaSat-3 Ka-band satellites that would expand coverage globally with throughput capacity of one terabit per second for each of the satellites.[52]
Exede Internet[edit]
Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

CARLSBAD, Calif., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ViaSat Inc. (Nasdaq:   VSAT), a global broadband services and technology company, announced today it received Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) approval from the FAA for its second generation (Gen-2) in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) system. The certification allows ViaSat to offer internet service on Boeing 737 aircraft. The first installation of the Gen-2 equipment was certified on a Qantas 737-800 aircraft in June 2017. 








Achieving STC approval demonstrates the flight worthiness of ViaSat's Gen-2 Ka-band radome, antenna, entertainment software and in-cabin Wi-Fi distribution system. The Gen-2 equipment can enable:

Even Faster In-Flight Internet Speeds: The Gen-2 system provides an onboard internet experience that consumers typically expect from ground-based Wi-Fi systems, with speeds that are 10 times faster than any other in-flight Wi-Fi system. 
More Capacity, More Streaming: The Gen-2 equipment drives more capacity from ViaSat's satellites, with an advanced modem set to support throughput levels of up to 1 Gigabit per second, and an upgraded antenna that will double the useable satellite capacity from ViaSat's satellites. Greater capacity will enable streaming at-scale – even at highly congested areas, including airport hubs. 
A Future-Proofed Broadband Solution: The Gen-2 system is forward and backward compatible with the ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3 class satellites, allowing airlines to cost-effectively deploy the Gen-2 equipment today, and take advantage of the more than 3.5 terabits per second of total global capacity ViaSat expects to offer in the next few years. In addition, the Gen-2 equipment is compatible with most other Ka-band satellites, giving airlines greater choice in satellite solution provider. 
Streamlined Installation: The Gen-2 system leverages the durable and aerodynamic ARINC 791 adapter plate, which streamlines installation with its standardized design. 
Enhanced Entertainment: The Gen 2 system supports the ViaSat wireless In-flight Entertainment (w-IFE) software package for a fully integrated IFEC experience. 
Added Storage for New Applications: The Gen-2 system comes packed with 30 terabytes of solid-state storage, far exceeding the capabilities of other in-flight servers deployed today. With added storage, airlines can host more crew and passenger-focused applications within its open platform server. 

"By achieving approval for the first ViaSat-2/ViaSat-3 compatible terminal STC, we are enabling airlines to offer in-flight internet service with unmatched quality, performance, scale and speed – both today and well into the future," said Don Buchman, vice president and general manager, Commercial Mobility, ViaSat. "This critical milestone will allow our airline customers and prospects to meet growing broadband needs at the best satellite economics."

History[edit]
Early history (1986-2004)[edit]
ViaSat was co-founded in May 1986 by Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and Steve Hart.[11][12][13] Mark Dankberg became chief executive officer and Mark Miller and Steve Hart became chief technical officers.[12] ViaSat received venture capital financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.[12][13] In December of 1996, ViaSat had its initial public offering(IPO).[12][11] The company offered $20 million in stock to the public, leaving the founders with 28 percent of the company and venture capital backers with 20 percent.[14]
The acquisition of the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta for $75 million in cash in 2000 helped ViaSat to focus on providing technology for interactive services to businesses.[15] ViaSat launched a spin-off company, TrellisWare Technology, in 2000. The self-funded company focuses on solutions for ground communications problems.[16][17]
In 2001, ViaSat started working with Boeing on Connexion broadband for airliners.[11] The company acquired Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications' products unit, Comsat Laboratories in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.[12][18][19] Comsat Laboratories is ViaSat's technology and product development group for communication systems focusing on developing new technologies for extremely bandwidth efficient, high data rate satellite transmission.[18][19][20] In 2001, ViaSat also purchased US Monolithics, a company focused on designing high frequency broadband circuitry, for around $30 million.[12][21][22] ViaSat won a contract with WildBlue Communications worth $16 million in March 2001 to build WildBlue's satellite modems to support the company’s initial service launch.[23] WildBlue signed a second contract with ViaSat in 2001 for $17 million and ViaSat would develop and produce satellite modem termination systems for six gateway stations.[24] Eutelsat entered an agreement in 2001 to use ViaSat’s LinkStar high performance IP terminals for their broadband multimedia network over Ku-based FSS satellites.[25] ViaSat entered a joint venture in 2001 with Loral Skynet to found Immeon Networks to develop the Immeon satellite bandwidth-on-demand service sold in monthly managed service plans. ABC News used Immeon to improve its voice and data-communications for on-location news.[26]
2005-present[edit]
WildBlue launched its internet service in October 2004 after gaining Ka-band transponder capacity on the Telesat Anik F2 satellite. It conducted formal technical testing until January 2005, followed by nationwide beta testing before the first residential retail customers had services installed in June.[27] The WildBlue service was upgraded in 2007 using the satellite WildBlue-1, which launched the year before.[28][29]
In 2005, ViaSat acquired Efficient Channel Coding, a producer of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems, which gave ViaSat access to the IPStar satellite broadband market.[30][13] Enerdyne, a defense technology firm, was acquired by ViaSat in 2006 for an initial investment of $17 million adding its EnerLinks II video data link equipment to ViaSat’s defense products.[31][13]
ViaSat acquired JAST Antenna Systems, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2007. JAST develops microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and mobile satellite applications.[32]
In December 2009, ViaSat bought WildBlue, based in Colorado, for $568 million in cash and stock.[33] ViaSat issued 4.3 million shares for the stock component of the purchase.[3] The United States Government granted stimulus funding to WildBlue to expand broadband coverage in rural areas.[34][35][36]
In 2010, ViaSat bought Stonewood Group of Dorset, England, an encryption company, for $20 million in cash and stock.[37]
In 2013, ViaSat contributed $1 million to University of California, San Diego's Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.[12] In January 2013, ViaSat broke ground for its expansion in Duluth, Georgia. The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014. Focused on government and enterprise customers, NetNearU has a wifi management system called TRACKOS, a cloud-based software.[7][8][9]
On June 1, 2017, ViaSat's $624 million Internet satellite, ViaSat-2, was launched. The launch was originally scheduled for April 25, 2017, but was delayed due to the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana.[47][48]
Satellites[edit]
ViaSat has three satellites, ViaSat-1, WildBlue1, and Anik-F2.[49] It purchased WildBlue in 2009, which had 2 satellites and 400,000 customers.[11] Space Systems/Loral built ViaSat-1 and it launched from Kazakhstan in October 2011 and entered service in January 2012.[11][33][12] ViaSat-1 can handle about 1 million users, and covers the residential US with additional coverage in Hawaii, Canada and Alaska through a Ka-band connection.[11]
ViaSat-1 runs on fixed beams trained on certain geographic areas and that will be expanded with the launch of ViaSat-2.[50] ViaSat-2 is under construction and due to launch in June 2017.[10] ViaSat has partnered with Boeing to build the satellite.[51] The coverage area will include Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, parts of northern South America and aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean.[51][11]
In November 2015, ViaSat announced that it was planning to order the first of three ViaSat-3 Ka-band satellites that would expand coverage globally with throughput capacity of one terabit per second for each of the satellites.[52]
Exede Internet[edit]
Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

ViaSat was co-founded in May 1986 by Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and Steve Hart.[11][12][13] Mark Dankberg became chief executive officer and Mark Miller and Steve Hart became chief technical officers.[12] ViaSat received venture capital financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.[12][13] In December of 1996, ViaSat had its initial public offering(IPO).[12][11] The company offered $20 million in stock to the public, leaving the founders with 28 percent of the company and venture capital backers with 20 percent.[14]
The acquisition of the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta for $75 million in cash in 2000 helped ViaSat to focus on providing technology for interactive services to businesses.[15] ViaSat launched a spin-off company, TrellisWare Technology, in 2000. The self-funded company focuses on solutions for ground communications problems.[16][17]
In 2001, ViaSat started working with Boeing on Connexion broadband for airliners.[11] The company acquired Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications' products unit, Comsat Laboratories in 2001 for an undisclosed amount.[12][18][19] Comsat Laboratories is ViaSat's technology and product development group for communication systems focusing on developing new technologies for extremely bandwidth efficient, high data rate satellite transmission.[18][19][20] In 2001, ViaSat also purchased US Monolithics, a company focused on designing high frequency broadband circuitry, for around $30 million.[12][21][22] ViaSat won a contract with WildBlue Communications worth $16 million in March 2001 to build WildBlue's satellite modems to support the company’s initial service launch.[23] WildBlue signed a second contract with ViaSat in 2001 for $17 million and ViaSat would develop and produce satellite modem termination systems for six gateway stations.[24] Eutelsat entered an agreement in 2001 to use ViaSat’s LinkStar high performance IP terminals for their broadband multimedia network over Ku-based FSS satellites.[25] ViaSat entered a joint venture in 2001 with Loral Skynet to found Immeon Networks to develop the Immeon satellite bandwidth-on-demand service sold in monthly managed service plans. ABC News used Immeon to improve its voice and data-communications for on-location news.[26]
2005-present[edit]
WildBlue launched its internet service in October 2004 after gaining Ka-band transponder capacity on the Telesat Anik F2 satellite. It conducted formal technical testing until January 2005, followed by nationwide beta testing before the first residential retail customers had services installed in June.[27] The WildBlue service was upgraded in 2007 using the satellite WildBlue-1, which launched the year before.[28][29]
In 2005, ViaSat acquired Efficient Channel Coding, a producer of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems, which gave ViaSat access to the IPStar satellite broadband market.[30][13] Enerdyne, a defense technology firm, was acquired by ViaSat in 2006 for an initial investment of $17 million adding its EnerLinks II video data link equipment to ViaSat’s defense products.[31][13]
ViaSat acquired JAST Antenna Systems, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2007. JAST develops microwave circuits and antennas for terrestrial and mobile satellite applications.[32]
In December 2009, ViaSat bought WildBlue, based in Colorado, for $568 million in cash and stock.[33] ViaSat issued 4.3 million shares for the stock component of the purchase.[3] The United States Government granted stimulus funding to WildBlue to expand broadband coverage in rural areas.[34][35][36]
In 2010, ViaSat bought Stonewood Group of Dorset, England, an encryption company, for $20 million in cash and stock.[37]
In 2013, ViaSat contributed $1 million to University of California, San Diego's Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination.[12] In January 2013, ViaSat broke ground for its expansion in Duluth, Georgia. The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014. Focused on government and enterprise customers, NetNearU has a wifi management system called TRACKOS, a cloud-based software.[7][8][9]
On June 1, 2017, ViaSat's $624 million Internet satellite, ViaSat-2, was launched. The launch was originally scheduled for April 25, 2017, but was delayed due to the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana.[47][48]
Satellites[edit]
ViaSat has three satellites, ViaSat-1, WildBlue1, and Anik-F2.[49] It purchased WildBlue in 2009, which had 2 satellites and 400,000 customers.[11] Space Systems/Loral built ViaSat-1 and it launched from Kazakhstan in October 2011 and entered service in January 2012.[11][33][12] ViaSat-1 can handle about 1 million users, and covers the residential US with additional coverage in Hawaii, Canada and Alaska through a Ka-band connection.[11]
ViaSat-1 runs on fixed beams trained on certain geographic areas and that will be expanded with the launch of ViaSat-2.[50] ViaSat-2 is under construction and due to launch in June 2017.[10] ViaSat has partnered with Boeing to build the satellite.[51] The coverage area will include Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, parts of northern South America and aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean.[51][11]
In November 2015, ViaSat announced that it was planning to order the first of three ViaSat-3 Ka-band satellites that would expand coverage globally with throughput capacity of one terabit per second for each of the satellites.[52]
Exede Internet[edit]
Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

The building was 60,000 square feet and a $10.5 million investment, which made Duluth the second largest location after the company’s headquarters in Carlsbad, California at the time.[38] ViaSat also acquired LonoCloud, a company focused on cloud networking software, in 2013.[39][40][41] In July 2013, ViaSat was licensed by the Federal Communications Commission for Ka-band aeronautical earth stations.[42]
In 2014, ViaSat partnered with Thuraya Telecommunications, a mobile satellite services operator, to provide M2M services (machine 2 machine).[43] The same year, ViaSat entered a partnership with LightSquared to work on M2M services in vehicular and aviation devices.[44][45] ViaSat also teamed with Southern California Edison to provide an easy transition into operational networks.[46] NetNearU based in Bryan/College Station, Texas was acquired in 2014. Focused on government and enterprise customers, NetNearU has a wifi management system called TRACKOS, a cloud-based software.[7][8][9]
On June 1, 2017, ViaSat's $624 million Internet satellite, ViaSat-2, was launched. The launch was originally scheduled for April 25, 2017, but was delayed due to the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana.[47][48]
Satellites[edit]
ViaSat has three satellites, ViaSat-1, WildBlue1, and Anik-F2.[49] It purchased WildBlue in 2009, which had 2 satellites and 400,000 customers.[11] Space Systems/Loral built ViaSat-1 and it launched from Kazakhstan in October 2011 and entered service in January 2012.[11][33][12] ViaSat-1 can handle about 1 million users, and covers the residential US with additional coverage in Hawaii, Canada and Alaska through a Ka-band connection.[11]
ViaSat-1 runs on fixed beams trained on certain geographic areas and that will be expanded with the launch of ViaSat-2.[50] ViaSat-2 is under construction and due to launch in June 2017.[10] ViaSat has partnered with Boeing to build the satellite.[51] The coverage area will include Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, parts of northern South America and aeronautical and maritime routes across the Atlantic Ocean.[51][11]
In November 2015, ViaSat announced that it was planning to order the first of three ViaSat-3 Ka-band satellites that would expand coverage globally with throughput capacity of one terabit per second for each of the satellites.[52]
Exede Internet[edit]
Exede Internet is a satellite Internet provider owned by ViaSat and reliant on ViaSat Satellites. The company provides satellite internet, voice over internet (VoiP), in-flight internet, and business satellite internet to over 657,000 customers.[6][7][9]
Exede Internet was launched in 2012, Exede Voice was announced June 13, 2013 which works through Exede Internet and is paired with satellite internet.[53] Exede in-flight WiFi is used by JetBlue, United Airlines, and Virgin America.[54][55][56]
Exede internet supports speeds of up to 25Mbps[57] and its business internet supports speeds of up to 15Mbps.[55] Exede partners with DirecTV to offer customers internet and TV bundles.[58]
Security systems[edit]
Eclypt hard drives and external USB drives produced by ViaSat are encrypted to ensure that data stored cannot be retrieved if a computer or storage device is stolen. Eclypt drives are used by governments, military forces, and law enforcement agencies.[59]
ViaSat Critical Infrastructure Security was introduced in 2013, designed to stop security breaches and monitor operation of grid networks using real-time intelligence.[60] The process adds encrypted sensors to the critical national infrastructure networks and monitors all abnormal activity through a security operations center.[61] ViaSat is working in conjunction with Southern California Edison to enhance their critical infrastructure security systems through a funding from the U.S. Department of Energy meant to improve protection of the nation's electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure from cyber-attack.[62][63]
Government communications[edit]
ViaSat also offers mobile two-way satellite broadband solutions to the United States Government.[64] Tactical communications for the US military involves tactical data, information assurance, and satellite communications. Tactical data links provide secure networking for voice and data. Information assurance for encryption devices allow for the transfer of classified data across public networks. Satellite communications give real-time intelligence for command and control functions.[65] The US government uses ArcLight technology over a managed private network that operates on Ku-band satellite links and can use the Yonder global satellite network as well.[42] The worldwide satellite broadband access that ViaSat offers allows for airborne mobile broadband for en route communications. The company has an airborne mobility program for C-17 jets and encrypts the satellite to hub link connections for the government.[66] ViaSat’s Satellite Access Manager (SAM) supports Department of Defense missions through airborne intelligence for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. SAM increases bandwidth utilization and efficiency through real-time network monitoring systems for the ArcLight2 broadband terminals.[67]

ViaSat, Inc.



Public
Defense - Aerospace
2,500 - 5,000 Employees





Digital Communication Products for Commercial and Government Markets

ViaSat began in 1986 with 3 people and under $25,000 in capital. The founders are Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller, and Steve Hart. The three had complementary skills and remain in key roles at the company today. Dankberg is Chairman and CEO, Miller is Chief Technical Officer, and Hart is Vice President of Engineering.

The initial business for ViaSat was obtaining contracts for engineering & proposal support from defense companies bidding satellite programs. Part of the agreement was that if these customers won contracts as a result, then ViaSat would be a subcontractor. After two such "proposal" contracts, ViaSat obtained venture financing of $300,000 from Southern California Ventures.

Despite this beginning in consulting, every contract was aimed at developing products to manufacture. The first breakthrough was to develop and manufacture specialized test equipment. This product may have been at the periphery of the industry, but created a product basis, and demonstrated ViaSat's ability to design & manufacture. Despite its very small capitalization and a declining defense budget, the strategy resulted in growing revenues every year, and a string of profitable years beginning in year two and continuing today.

A continuing strength of ViaSat is its wide breadth of products.

Our inital successes in defense and government related products continues today with our Government Systems division. Products include terminals, control systems, and training terminals for UHF and wideband military satcom; MIDS/Link-16 tactical communication terminals; data messaging processors and software for clear communication over noisy tactical channels; RF communication simulation systems; and secure networking products enabling encrypted communication over non-secure networks.

ViaSat has built its line of commercial VSAT products into the broadest in the industry. In April, 2000 the company acquired the satellite networking business of Scientific-Atlanta, adding the SkyRelay VSAT and Skylinx DAMA satellite networking product lines, the Satellite Ground Systems gateways and satellite antenna systems business, and a worldwide sales and service organization. Then in mid-2001 ViaSat acquired the VSAT products group of Lockheed-Martin Global Telecommunications, now known as our Comsat Laboratories division. Established in 1967 to perform leading-edge research and development, Comsat Laboratories pioneering role in satellite communication technologies continues today. Comsat Labs includes our VSAT products group and an engineering, research, and systems development business as well.

For the fiscal year ending April 1, 2007, revenues topped $516 million. ViaSat is nationally known for its record of rapid growth. Prior to going public, ViaSat was listed on the INC.500 list of fastest growing private companies three times. The company is on the Forbes list of "200 Best Small Companies", and the BusinessWeek list of "100 Best Small Corporations." In addition, ViaSat is an ISO9001 certified company.

ViaSat employs over 1,500 highly skilled professionals. In December, 1996 the company began trading as a public company on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Note: Comsat Labs and Comsat Laboratories are trade names of ViaSat Inc. Neither Comsat Labs nor Comsat Laboratories is affiliated with COMSAT Corporation. "Comsat" is a registered trademark of COMSAT Corporation.

About ViaSat








ViaSat is in the business to connect the world. As a global broadband services and technology company, we are connecting international communities to the internet by offering residential internet service; enabling passengers and operations crews to stream high-bandwidth media, applications, and content when traveling globally on commercial, business or government aircraft and maritime vessels; and empowering international warfighters on the front lines of battle with real-time, secure internet-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for high-requirement missions. We deliver and protect information – when and where it is needed most – with our trusted communications ground systems, infrastructure, and services.
Our more than 3,700 global team members are dedicated to do what others in the industry view as impossible. We imagined and launched the world’s highest-capacity communications satellite and continue to set the standard in developing technologies that address global broadband challenges and ensure a better way for consumers, businesses, governments, and military personnel to stay connected.
We think big, we act intelligently, and we’re not done…we’re just beginning.
 
Use the interactive graphic below to find out more about what we do or watch videos About ViaSat on our YouTube channel.



ViaSat specializes in engineering creative ways to connect people to communication applications that improve their productivity, quality of life – and even safety – when terrestrial networks are not practical, cost effective, or able to provide a high-quality service.
We provide consumer, commercial and government customers with communications services and systems that exceed expectations for performance, anywhere in the world. With intelligently optimized services, integrated systems, and groundbreaking technology, we deliver seamless communications that meet unique demands.
Open these interactive diagrams to get an overview of the applications for our systems and services.


Satellite Systems
We extend the reach of networks beyond terrestrial connections with our satellite communication systems. The success of Ka-band satellite Internet in the U.S. and Europe is leading to further expansion in global markets. We support more Ka-band satellite capacity than anyone else and continue to push the state-of-the-art in network performance, applications, and economics. We also build network systems for efficient satellite data backhaul and cellular network extension.


Mobile and Portable Services
Yonder ® high-speed mobile Internet is a global network serving business jets, maritime vessels, trains, and government customers. Our maritime partner KVH Industries is the market leader. We believe Ka-band is the future for mobile satellite too. Our high-capacity Ka-band network is hosting in-flight broadband for commercial airlines, with JetBlue and United as inaugural customers. Piggybacking on our Exede service network, we offer portable services using compact vehicle-mounted terminals or one that packs into a case small enough to be hand carried or checked as standard-sized luggage. An office-like, two-way broadband connection to virtually any location in the U.S. and Canada opens up new possibilities for broadcast journalists, emergency first responders, law enforcement, government agencies, and live event producers.


Consumer Services
We’re transforming satellite broadband with our high-capacity satellite system. Service providers in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia have selected our systems to provide faster speeds and quicker response than ever thought possible for internet over satellite. Speed that is 10 times faster than previous satellite internet service. Our high-capacity system offers the economics, ability to serve mass markets, and the consumer experience that meets today’s demands for high-bandwidth online media and content. Launched in January 2012 using ViaSat-1, the highest capacity satellite in the world, our Exede Internet service is building on subscriber base of nearly 700,000 households.


Antenna Systems and Gateways
Completing the connection from satellite to the ground requires tying the satellite network into the terrestrial grid. We engineer and manufacture the large antenna systems that accomplish that task. Applications include digital HD television, satellite imaging, military communications, broadband networks, telemetry, satellite tracking, and teleports. We also design and produce small antennas for mobile and transportable satellite communications.


Military Satcom
We help tactical warfighters and emergency first responders access and share trusted information from any location to make better decisions faster. Defense and homeland security organizations count on us for satcom products and capabilities at many frequency bands. Our network building blocks bring the efficiency of commercial satellite technology to milsatcom. The EBEM modem is the new military standard for the Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) system. Now designated a Current Force Modem, our LinkWay ® mesh system has eclipsed all other high-speed satellite modem installations combined. And the Joint IP Modem (JIPM) is the only bandwidth efficient modem certified to new military standards for IP networking among all forces. In addition, since the 1990s we have been the market leader for UHF satcom equipment.


Tactical Data Links and Line-of-Sight Networks
We’re also more than a satellite company. Link 16 tactical data links is one of our largest business areas. This joint military system gives all combatants greater situational awareness in any battle space by collecting information and combining it into a digital view of the battlefield. As one of only two qualified suppliers, ViaSat has captured the lead in the global market for “MIDS” terminals and the new software-programmable Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) version is now in full production. We also supply digital video links for unmanned systems (UAS) that increase the range, security and effectiveness of UAVs as they become a greater part of military strategy.


Cybersecurity and Information Assurance
As government and military communications have migrated to Internet Protocol (including Ipv6) there’s a corresponding need to secure data traveling over the internet or other public networks or residing in digital data storage devices such as hard drives. Building primarily around the development of the High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryption Interoperability Standard (HAIPE ® IS), we are successfully growing its market share for DoD cybersecurity, encryption, and information assurance systems with both stand-alone products and modular, embeddable security.


Mobile Services
Airborne ISR and Command and Control on-the-move (C2OTM) are fast growing segments of our business that use the same technology as our commercial Yonder ® mobile satellite network. More capable cameras and sensors create the need for megabit speeds and HD video, driving the desire for performance as good as a wired cable or high-speed DSL modem as troops move in vehicles, airplanes, and helicopters. We have also successfully won the equipment and service provider role for the next generation of Blue Force Tracking, a potential $1 billion market. The BFT-2 situational awareness network increases safety for highly mobile forces in combat.
