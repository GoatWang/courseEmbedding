They not only have great ideas, but also the drive to make them a reality. They use their fresh thinking and hard work to create positive social change – bringing new concepts and products to market, and creating jobs and wealth.	We have long recognized the potential of entrepreneurs. Over the past three decades, we have been working with entrepreneurs, adapting our experience, industry capabilities and resources to work for entrepreneurial, fast-growth companies. We work with a range of businesses, from those receiving their first venture funding through to large mid-cap companies, whose value may be measured in billions of dollars.	Our commitment to entrepreneurial companies, in both emerging and developed economies around the world, helps ensure that we’re working with more of tomorrow’s global leaders, today. EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® –  celebrating entrepreneurs	We started the Entrepreneur Of The Year Awards program to celebrate successful entrepreneurs, so they could share their stories, inspire others and receive the recognition they deserve. Our first program took place in 1986 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States	By 1987 it was held across 11 US cities. And in 1993 the program started to expand internationally. Today the program spans more than 140 cities in 50 countries, which together represent more than 90% of the global economy.	Over the past five years, more than 6,500 entrepreneurs joined the Entrepreneur Of The Year alumni. A “who’s who” of both developed and emerging markets, these alumni include many household names. Over half of today’s top 100 NASDAQ companies have won Entrepreneur Of The Year, and most received the award before they achieved top 100 status.	Ten years ago we decided to go global and started World Entrepreneur Of The Year. Held annually in Monaco, Entrepreneur Of The Year country winners compete for the World Entrepreneur Of The Year title. Past winners include Michael Spencer of ICAP plc, Guy Laliberté of Cirque du Soleil and Narayana Murthy of Infosys Technologies.     Nature or nurture?	Entrepreneurs turn excellent ideas into successful businesses. But where does this capacity come from? We look into the mind of the entrepreneur.     Entrepreneurial insights We interviewed more than 40 of the world's leading entrepreneurs and captured their thought- provoking observations in this unique collection of video conversations.

Dunleavy, MD 		2015 Road to Palm Springs 		In many ways, Inovalon reads like a textbook example of entrepreneurial innovation.	   		  		Inovalon		CEO, Chairman and Founder		Bowie, MD		Year founded: 1998 		Founded in 1998 in the spare bedroom of a Baltimore townhouse, Keith Dunleavy, M.D., the company’s CEO, Chairman and Founder, has grown the company from a single-employee entity into a leading technology company for the health care landscape that it is today. 		Balancing work and self-funded studies at Dartmouth, Dr. Dunleavy launched his first company selling computer upgrades while working as a teaching assistant in computer sciences, engineering, and neuroscience to help pay the bills. He graduated from Dartmouth with a degree in biology modified by engineering, earning high honors for his thesis work on computer simulations of the human cerebellum. 		After graduating from Harvard Medical School he headed to Johns Hopkins Hospital for his residency. It was there that he began the company that would ultimately evolve into Inovalon. Today, Inovalon combines data analytics and data-driven intervention platforms to help health care industry leaders achieve meaningful insight and impact in clinical and quality outcomes, utilization and financial performance. 		In 2014 the company experienced year-over-year net income growth of 99.7%. His accomplishments and viability were further underscored when, on February 12, 2015, Dr. Dunleavy rang the opening bell on the NASDAQ National Marketplace, starting the trading day on which his company would make its public debut with a market capitalization of more than $4 billion.

Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
Inovalon
Dr. Dunleavy serves as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board for Inovalon, Inc., a leading technology-enabled healthcare solutions provider focused on the importance of healthcare data and its ability to drive improvement in clinical and quality outcomes, care management and financial performance throughout the U.S. healthcare community. In this role, Dr. Dunleavy is responsible for the overall execution of the Company’s business plan, expansion of strategic relationships, and the identification and realization of Company product strategy and vision.
Since organizing the foundations of Inovalon, Dr. Dunleavy has focused on addressing the rising role of patient-specific healthcare data; the coordinated integration, abstraction and analysis of its discordant sources; and the resulting realization of material improvements in clinical and quality outcomes, claims and payment integrity, care coordination, and healthcare data intelligence. Powered by the ongoing analysis of more than 7.7 billion longitudinally matched medical events within the Company’s Medical Outcomes Research for Effectiveness and Economics Registry (MORE2 Registry®) dataset, Inovalon’s analytics uniquely drive highly specific insight into specific venue, timing, modality, and content of interventions that result in meaningful improvements in the quality, economics, and insights of healthcare. After several years of growth, Inovalon’s solutions now touch more than 220,000 clinical facilities, 540,000 physicians, and 140 million Americans.
Prior to organizing the foundations of Inovalon, Dr. Dunleavy worked in areas of management consulting designed to leverage the benefits of multidisciplinary personnel teams with prowess within the basic sciences, software technology, business strategy, finance, and operational scaling. In this role, he has served in a wide range of design, strategy, and management positions for an array of basic science research, corporate development initiatives, and private equity projects.
Dr. Dunleavy received a Bachelor’s degree in Biology modified with Engineering with High Honors from Dartmouth College where his thesis work focused on applications of computer-simulated artificial human cerebellar functional units. Dr. Dunleavy earned his doctorate in medicine from Harvard Medical School, completed his medical residency at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, practiced and was Board Certified in Internal Medicine. He serves as a Director on the Dartmouth Medical School Board of Overseers, a Director on the Board of Directors of the DMAA: The Care Continuum Alliance, has authored or co-authored a number of scientific journal articles, abstracts, and proprietary research papers, and has presented his work and materials at multiple national and international conferences. Most recently, he participated in two prominent national panels: Bloomberg Government Healthcare Summit, “Mind the Gap: Connecting Healthcare Policy with Next Century Innovation,” and the Economist’s 2013 Health Care Forum.
