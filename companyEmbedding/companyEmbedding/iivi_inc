Our Name and History
The Roman numerals “II-VI” refers to group II and group VI of the Periodic Table of Elements. By chemically combining elements from these groups, II-VI produced the infrared optical crystalline compounds: Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), Zinc Selenide (ZnSe), Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) and Zinc Sulfide MultiSpectral (ZnS MS). These compounds and others created from group II and group VI elements are commonly referred to as “II-VI Materials”. Founded in 1971 to create CdTe, company co-founder Dr. Carl J. Johnson paid homage to our II-VI Materials heritage by calling our new company “II-VI Incorporated”.







Community & Environment
II-VI reaches out and teams up with local communities to make a difference around the globe with the support of our diverse expertise, resources and time to enhance the communities in which our employees live and work. Our commitment includes:

 Developing policies and practices that integrate responsible behaviors into daily business operations
 Protecting the safety and improving the lives of workers and the communities where our Company conducts business

Through recycling efforts, II-VI Incorporated recycles literally tons of material every year that would otherwise require disposal in landfills.

Marlow Industries, a subsidiary of II-VI Incorporated, provides thermal energy harvesting products to power wireless sensors and other microdevices, thereby eliminating the need for battery-powered solutions. Marlow’s family of thermal energy harvests converts small degrees of temperature differences into electrical (DC) power. This reliable energy source can perpetually power wireless sensors and microdevices for the lifetime of the harvester, offering a low-cost and zero maintenance solution for wireless sensor technology.

						      One such example of the thermal energy harvester is the patent pending EverGen™ Power Strap that utilizes Marlow’s rugged thermoelectric generator (TEG) technology to harvest heat/thermal energy from fluid filled pipes of exhaust stacks to provide a viable, economical and perpetual power source for industrial and oil/gas applications.

II-VI offers a diverse portfolio of products which are manufactured with inputs provided by thousands of suppliers, all of which make up II-VI’s global supply chain.  At II-VI, we strive to act in an environmentally and socially responsible manner, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, while meeting the needs of our customers and shareholders.
On August 22, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the final rule regarding the sourcing of “conflict minerals” (i.e. tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Under the rule, publicly traded companies, like II-VI, must report to the SEC the presence of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries in the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture if the conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of their products.  These reports must be filed with the SEC annually by May 31st, beginning in 2014.
II-VI is concerned that the trade of conflict minerals mined in the eastern provinces of the DRC may be fueling human rights atrocities in the region.  These minerals are widely used in our products and the end markets served by II-VI.  As a result, we support the actions of governments and organizations to increase supply chain transparency and enable companies to source conflict-free minerals.
II-VI is committed to sourcing materials from companies that share our values around human rights, ethics and environmental responsibility. We have initiated a comprehensive process to meet these regulatory requirements, taking steps to increase our supply chain due diligence measures and internal controls for the covered minerals. II-VI also expects its suppliers to develop internal conflict minerals policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems which are designed to identify and ultimately eliminate from use in products sold to II-VI any conflict minerals which are known to come from sources funding armed groups in the DRC region.
II-VI fully expects our suppliers to cooperate with us and to provide information to support these efforts.  Suppliers that do not reasonably comply with II-VI’s Conflict Minerals Policy will be reviewed by II-VI to assess whether we will conduct business with those suppliers in the future. We will disclose our progress in implementing this Conflict Minerals Policy through public reporting, including through our website and SEC filings.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

10-kW Laser Optics
Photonics SpectraMar 2017II-VI Inc., II-VI InfraredRequest Info 
        

            SAXONBURG, Pa. — II-VI Inc. has announced a new line of optics designed for 10-kW class fiber and direct diode lasers.


The optics are made from low-absorbing fused silica substrates. They undergo magneto rheological finishing to achieve <λ/10 of surface irregularity and <1 nm of roughness. With a high-performance, proprietary ion beam sputtering coating, they achieve <10 ppm of total absorption loss. The 10-kW optics are available in many complex shapes used in today’s high power beam shaping applications such as aspheres, axicons and high aspect ratio lenses. Improved lens quality enables the lasers to maintain high reliability at high power levels and over long periods of time.


The next-generation fiber and direct diode lasers can be used in metal cutting and welding, as well as additive manufacturing.Visit company websitehttp://www.iiviinfrared.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=6493
