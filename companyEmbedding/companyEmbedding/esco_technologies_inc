CareConnect, another subsidiary, specializes in telephone, TV, Internet and eCall systems in senior housing communities.

ESCO Technologies is a technology-centric organization that expends a preponderance of staff resources on developing customer focused technology solutions, mainly for utilities. Its subsidiaries have dedicated IT staff, although some of these managers are located at the corporate headquarters in Saint Louis, Missouri.

One of the companies business units, Aclara, has its own dedicated IT staff. This division's VP of Information Systems handles internal IT, while initiatives involving software development and architecture are managed by the VP of Software Engineering.

At CareConnect, a subsidiary providing telecom services to senior living communities, the IT Manager supervises IT operations. However, most of the technical staff there deals with work related to the telecom systems solutions it provides, including system implementations and networks.

ESCO has an IT group at the Doble Engineering division which operates separately as well. Managers here deal with the computing infrastructure and enterprise applications. The technical group manages about 80 physical servers, runs a help desk, and supports several offices and laboratories in the US and abroad.
