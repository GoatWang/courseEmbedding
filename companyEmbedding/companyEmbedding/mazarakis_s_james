In 1998 Mr. Mazarakis was promoted to Managing Director and given the additional responsibility of managing the technology group supporting JP Morgan’s US Investment Management division.

  ClassPass.

  ClassPass, a fitness-class booking company, can be found in 39
  cities around the world. It has generated more than 30 million
  class reservations since Payal Kadakia founded the company in
  2013. One year later, it raised 
  a big round of financing at a $350 million post-money
  valuation.


  But building ClassPass hasn't been easy. The first version of the
  startup, Classtivity, flopped. Later, ClassPass significantly
  changed its pricing model, and users screamed. There have also
  been comparisons to Groupon and skepticism that it can keep both
  gymgoers and gyms happy.


  Additionally, a slew of competitors have launched to compete with
  ClassPass on price. In June, ClassPass raised a new round of
  financing that was 
  reportedly a "down round," meaning the price of its shares
  were lower than in the previous round it raised. The company's
  new valuation is about $470 million, post-money.


  Kadakia recently stepped down from her role as CEO, a decision
  she explained in an interview with Business Insider
  Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell on our podcast, "Success! How I
  Did It."


  "The impact we have on people's lives to me is more important
  than any title anyone can carry," she said. "I want little girls
  to believe that they can be CEOs. The best thing I could do,
  though, is be an empowered female and authentically doing what I
  love. That's the message I want to send, not "Go and do things
  you don't like because that's what the world needs," right?"


  In the wide-ranging conversation, Kadakia and Shontell discussed:


Her passion for dancing and how it led to a nearly $400
  million startup.
  
How she decided to pivot a struggling startup into one that
  would work.
  
How ClassPass finally got traction and what it was like to
  suddenly be a startup every investor wanted a piece of.
  
How to run a startup when you have two conflicting customers
  you need to keep happy (gymgoers and gyms).
  
Her decision to step down as CEO and how she spends her days
  now.

  If you'd rather read the interview, here's a transcript, which
  has been lightly edited for clarity and length:

Alyson Shontell: We have Payal Kadakia here with
  us today. She created ClassPass. It's a company where you book
  local fitness classes for a set amount per month, like $100 a
  month or something. There were some tough years in the beginning,
  but then it started to soar, and you recently made the tough
  decision to step away from the CEO role. You're still involved
  very much so in an executive chairman position. We want to talk
  about all that.


  First, let's go back. You're a world-class dancer, right? You've
  been dancing since you were little. That's part of what inspired
  you to do this company.

Payal Kadakia: I started dancing when I was 3
  years old in my basement with my mom's best friend, and it was my
  way of getting to know my culture, but it also became more than
  that for me. It became this place where I felt like I could be
  anyone. I felt really centered, and I loved it. Dance became this
  thing I fought to keep in my life throughout my career, through
  my college years, because I just felt so alive and so confident
  when I did it, and so I never wanted to lose it.

Shontell: You have both sides of your brain
  going — you also went to MIT.

Kadakia: My parents immigrated here in the '70s.
  Education, a good career were obviously North Stars for them. At
  the same time, I wanted the discipline. I wanted to make sure I
  entered the real world in the right way. I loved math and
  science, so that was the other side of me, and my creative side
  was really in dance and choreography.


  Passion for dance

Shontell: What kind of dance?

Kadakia: It's Indian folk and classical dance.
  When I was in school — especially at MIT — I even wanted to dance
  there. So I went and started a dance company, a dance troupe
  that's still on campus today. For me, when I felt like it didn't
  exist, I created it. And that's sort of very much the way I live
  and think about most things: When it's not there, I know if I'm
  passionate enough I'll go and create it myself. When I left MIT
  and I came here to New York, I had my job at Bain, and the first
  thing I did when I got here was look for where I was going to go
  take Bollywood dance classes. During my Bain days, I would invite
  my entire company to my shows. It's just one of those things that
  I think made me Payal, and everyone associated me with it.


  When I was, I would say, entering my third year of Bain, most
  people at that point decide what they are going to do after, and
  either they stay at Bain or they go to business school — it's
  usually the trajectory. I wanted to find a way to dance more and
  to build something that was something more relevant and in the
  Indian dance space. I took a great job at Warner Music Group. I
  got to see the entire music industry transform and got to meet
  amazing people like Daniel Ek at Spotify. I was sort of doing
  that on the day job, and every night for four hours I would dance
  with a group of girls that also were professionals and amazing at
  their jobs. We would travel on the weekends and go and perform.


  I always remember we ended up on the cover of the art section of
  The New York Times. This was two years into my Warner experience,
  maybe six months into when I started the company. I didn't even
  have a website, and I remember my boss was like, "Are you going
  to come into work tomorrow? I don't know. I think I saw you on
  the cover of the art section of The New York Times." I love
  moments like that. It makes you realize that you could do so much
  and accomplish so much if you're focused and passionate about
  what you do.


  Turning a hobby into a career

  keynote.
ClassPass



Shontell: When we first met, you had joined
  something called Tech Stars. Your startup was called Classtivity
  at the time. It was a variation of what ClassPass is now. Was
  that the first company you had — I guess you started the dance
  company, but that was your first experience with tech?

Kadakia: Yeah, outside of building some small
  models and algorithmic programs at MIT, I really hadn't built
  something of that scale, and the reason I did it was I was one
  day sitting at my desk. I was looking for a ballet class to take,
  and I was online and hours had passed by, and I didn't choose
  what I would do. And at that moment, I was like, why is this so
  difficult? Why is there not a website like OpenTable or Seamless
  Web or Zocdoc that was just aggregating all this information? And
  that made sense — I think it made sense to a lot of people
  because I raised a million dollars on that concept.


  So then when we launched it and no one went to class, that was
  really hard for me, because that was my mission. My mission
  wasn't to build just a tech website that looked nice and had all
  the information — it was to get people to go to class and pursue
  their passion and fall back in love with a hobby like I had with
  dance. I realized we weren't creating that impact, and so when I
  came to terms with that, I decided that we should pivot.

Shontell: So before we get to the pivot, though,
  let's talk about: You leave Warner, you join Tech Stars. How do
  you get into Tech Stars? Tech Stars is this accelerator program
  where startups would apply, and it was really rigorous. It was
  hard to get into. David Tisch, who was a big venture capitalist
  in the New York area, was running it. How did you wind up there
  doing this?

Kadakia: I had this idea brewing in my head, and
  the vice chairman of Warner Music Group, Michael Fleisher, called
  me. He was like, "Why don't you come to my office? I'd love to
  hear about this." I'd maybe met him three times in my three years
  there. I ended up spending two hours explaining to him what I
  wanted to build. And he was like, "You know what? I love this."
  He became my investor, and he also was one of the mentors in the
  Tech Stars program. He emailed David Tisch that day, and to me,
  it was about relationships. I know I did the application and all
  of it. I really truly believe, though, I got in because people
  referred me.


  And I always tell entrepreneurs this: Yes, it's about your
  application — they're going to get thousands — but find a way to
  really get a good reference. Right? Or get someone to support you
  into the program. I know I had a lot of people who were vouching
  for me being like, "I believe in Payal, I believe in this idea,"
  and I really believe it's because of that.

Shontell: This company that you're building in
  Tech Stars, Classtivity, it's an OpenTable for classes. You could
  go on and you could see, OK, I want to take a Pilates class, here
  are the places and the times.

Kadakia: It was: be active and be creative. It
  had fitness stuff on there, it also had creative stuff on there,
  like cooking classes and photography. Basically, you could go on,
  you could search by genre, then you could pick the time, and then
  you could pick the location, and then we would show you the
  schedule.


  Even though this was a different product, it actually helped us
  during that time build all the integrations into getting all the
  schedule data. It wasn't easy to do that — I mean, there's so
  many classes happening all day long, and we were trying to pull
  in the feed of information to say, "Here's all the up-to-date
  information on what's available at every given time." Even though
  it was a phase at the company where the product didn't work, it
  actually did help us build a lot of the scheduling integration
  that we need to on the back end.


  Raising money for a startup



ClassPass


Shontell: So Tech Stars has this demo day.
  You're presenting to a room full of investors and journalists and
  things. I was in the audience listening to you present.

Kadakia: It was so long ago.

Shontell: What happened after that? Does the
  money come easily? Was it a bit of a slog? I know you had two
  different cofounders, I think, at the time.

Kadakia: When you have the hype of something
  like Tech Stars, it definitely gives you some clout. But at the
  end of the day, we didn't have the numbers at the time. It was a
  moment for me to go back to my mission, and I decided we would
  let go of certain people. We would focus the company on pivoting
  and iterating, which was a hard decision to do but what was the
  point of keeping a product up and funding that when it's not
  working?

Shontell: Because people weren't booking
  classes, or there were no users, or what was the problem?

Kadakia: They were coming and looking at the
  schedule data, but they weren't actually purchasing the classes,
  so they weren't actually going to class, and we kept changing the
  buttons. I think the day I knew, we sent out an email saying, "Go
  to class for free," and still no one went. I think the most
  transformative companies are ones that actually change human
  behavior, and so while I had made it easy to go in search, I
  hadn't motivated anyone to go to class.

Shontell: OK, so you decide you need to make
  this change, but you raised a little bit of money after Tech
  Stars and then, I think — according to Crunchbase, at least — two
  years later, you raised your next round.

Kadakia: During that first year and a half, we
  raised roughly around $1 million-plus after Tech Stars. I mean,
  we were good about our burn, right, so I had enough cash in the
  bank. That was one of my important points to even my team, like,
  "Wait, why are we switching?" It's like, "We have money right
  now." The worst thing you could do is wait for it to run out with
  the wrong product. We actually had enough stamina and enough
  funding to go through the next year, but it was more of: Are we
  going to make the hard decisions to get and build the product
  that was going to get us to the next round of funding?


  Why joining a startup accelerator was a huge help — and the
  secret to getting accepted into one



Sarah
  Jacobs


Shontell: You guys start building this other
  product and you run a promotion, right? And something changes.

Kadakia: What we ended up doing is, OK, let's go
  talk to these studio owners and figure out what they wanted, and
  what we realized is a lot of them were offering the first class
  for free. So what we did was we packaged up the first classes for
  free and built a product called the Passport, which was a
  one-month offering where people could go and try all these first
  classes for free as a new customer.


  The bet we were making is, OK, people are going to do this and
  then go back and buy a package at these studios. So we were
  collecting ratings and reviews on every single rating and class
  that you went to. My internal benchmark was 70% of people who
  gave something a positive rating would go back, and we weren't
  seeing that. We were seeing like 10% to 15% of people go back,
  which, to me, was while it was great revenue for us and people
  were finally going to class and it was beautiful profit, it
  wasn't a good business model. I didn't want to build a one-month
  experience for my customers — I wanted to build a lifestyle where
  you stayed active and passionate. And for the business owners, I
  was actually not sending them any money, so when I fast-forwarded
  that, in terms of the business, in terms of the product, we had
  to make another hard decision of saying, "This is wrong."


  When we actually looked at the data, we saw that so many
  customers were actually buying the membership over and over again
  with different email addresses, which gave us some sort of sense
  of maybe this is a monthly subscription. We also did a survey,
  and 95% of them said they wanted to do this experience over and
  over again.

Shontell: That was visiting different studios
  around you.

Kadakia: The variety was a part of the magic. We
  almost stumbled upon that. How important that was, and it wasn't
  just a one-month discovery thing — it was a part of people's way
  of life. You know, we had a meeting, and we were like OK, there's
  something here, and we decided to iterate and build this
  subscription model as well. We still have this search engine up,
  the Passport and the ClassPass model up at this time. And you
  know, the team, we all were sitting there, and we were kind of
  like, OK, what do we do? We started getting such positive
  feedback on this subscription. People were now emailing me with
  things that were about their life changing because of this
  product, and they felt confident. It wasn't even about, like, "I
  went and worked out," you know? It was something bigger.


  I think as an entrepreneur and a founder who had been doing this
  for three and a half years, and I did it because of my passion
  for dance, I felt like I had given them dance, what dance was to
  me. In that moment, I just knew we kind of had hit that magic and
  that lightning that was going to be revolutionary for that
  industry.

Shontell: You all took this product out to
  studios without it even really formed. You said we're going to
  start doing this thing — it's going to be $49 a month? For
  unlimited classes?

Kadakia: $49 was 10 classes.

Shontell: For 10 classes. And you could do barre
  classes. You could do Pilates classes. Before, I think maybe the
  assumption was you're going to join a gym, or you're going to be
  into yoga, or you're going to be into barre.

Kadakia: Commitment to one studio.

Shontell: Right, but not combining — like
  cherry-picking what you wanted to do based on how you felt and
  how you wanted to work out that day.

Kadakia: And to be honest, technologically, it
  was hard to do it, because how are you going to look at all the
  information? And then also it just wasn't a concept anyone had
  really done. If you wanted to be a dabbler, you would probably
  have a gym membership because it was too expensive to do that,
  actually doing it for the studios.


  Pivoting to ClassPass




ClassPass



Shontell: Talk about how you get the pivot off
  and running, how you talked to investors about it, how do you
  talk to your team about it, how do you plant the flag and say,
  "OK, guys, Classtivity was cool, but now we're going to be
  ClassPass, and we're going to do this whole new thing."

Kadakia: We had actually put ClassPass up before
  we changed our name. Basically what happened is we decided that
  we would try this other iteration, which would be the membership,
  which we launched in June 2013. Three months in, we started
  seeing this exponential growth of ClassPass. It was completely
  viral. We went from 35 users to like, 300, you know what I mean?
  In a matter of three months. That's exponential growth.

Shontell: You mean 35,000?

Kadakia: No, I'm talking about, like, hundreds.
  I'm talking about, like, really small numbers.

Shontell: Oh, wow, so actually 35.

Kadakia: Thirty-five people in our first month.
  I always say that to people, because people want these bigger
  numbers but we're building a subscription and a lifestyle, and
  you need to figure out what your numbers are going to be. For us,
  when we got to a thousand members, we were at a million-dollar
  run rate. So to me, that was what I was trying to get to, right?
  When you have a $100 subscription, that's what you're aiming for.
  What was so great is we saw the growth of ClassPass surpass the
  Passport and Classtivity as a search engine, and so what we ended
  up doing is in February of the following year changing our name
  to ClassPass, rebranding. We shut down the search engine. We took
  out the Passport. And I actually remember one of my advisers,
  Andrew Weinrich, he always would say to me, "Just get rid of the
  Passport" — he could see this. We kind of were like, "Well it's
  what gave us the variety, and maybe people want the Passport and
  then we'll do ClassPass." And he was like, "It's like crack to
  you guys. It'll be a chapter in your book." I didn't fully
  understand at that moment what that meant and now I totally
  understand what he meant. Sometimes you just have to be able to
  know that it's the wrong product and move on.

  know that it's the wrong product and move on.

Shontell: What was the initial thing you offered
  to users as this new company?

Kadakia: With ClassPass, it was $99 for 10
  classes. We had about 50 studios in New York City, probably,
  signed up at the time.

Shontell: $99 was a steal when you considered
  that a spin class around here in New York City, costs about,
  what, $30 a session at least?

Kadakia: Yeah. I mean, in the beginning, we
  weren't working with a lot of the top-tier studios. These were a
  lot of, like, I would say, studios that had a lot of excess
  capacity — weren't really big names. We got the big names as the
  product kept growing, which was also part of the fun war stories
  that we have. We didn't, in the beginning, have contracts with
  all the studios, but we realized that the brand names mattered,
  so we were fulfilling a lot of these reservations manually
  without any integrations, just to see — we needed to figure out
  what the customer wanted. That's the ultimate thing. That's what
  you need to do. You need to keep figuring out what the customer
  really wants, and we didn't know.


  Serving 2 sets of customers



Sarah
  Jacobs


Shontell: You had the tricky job of having two
  sets of customers: You had studios that you have to make happy
  that you're partnering with, that you're paying checks to every
  month based on referrals, and you have people like me who use
  ClassPass and are signing up for classes and want the best
  prices. This a problem that Uber has, the same thing, with
  keeping drivers happy, keeping customers happy. It's very hard to
  balance the two. How did you figure that out, and did you ever
  make mistakes with it?

Kadakia: One of the things that was really
  important to me — it's actually something I studied at MIT —
  which was management of inventory and capacity utilization. We
  never wanted to cannibalize. We were trying to do is figure out
  where they had excess capacity, and that was something we built
  into the system from the beginning of saying, "We're going to
  make available the spots that you're not selling, so this is
  incremental revenue." That was a really important part of our
  value proposition from the beginning, and we also restricted how
  many times you could go to anyone's studio for that purpose as
  well. It was a matter of protecting — if you want to be a
  loyalist, we were like, "Please go sign up at the studio." This
  product is not for that person.

Shontell: You couldn't do all 10 classes at the
  same studio.

Kadakia: You can't. Right. That was part of the
  premise of getting you to say, "Let's just get people who
  actually were scared to work out," and we wanted to make it
  accessible for people to say yes so then obviously our partners
  would have more inventory utilized and the classes would be more
  energetic and full. That was really the premise it was started
  under and maintained under.


  Obviously, as we grew, we had to keep figuring out what those
  inventory limits were and continue to build algorithms for our
  studio owners that kept optimizing their revenue, and we're still
  working on that. What's amazing is how much data we have to be
  able to now predict. If you change your schedule around, you
  would get this much more money. Those are the things that we can
  do for our partners now because we have so much data historically
  on how much their 8 p.m. class on a Wednesday sells out.


  Keeping investors interested

Shontell: How hard was it the first few years,
  and were investors actually interested in it? Did you find that
  it hard to pitch to them at first?

Kadakia: I think I had a lot of people who were
  like, "Payal, we love you, but product's not there," or "Business
  is not there." I never gave up, though. I think as a founder and
  entrepreneur you just keep hustling through it. I knew I'd figure
  it out, and as long as you don't run out of money, which is the
  No. 1 key, that's like your right to keep going. You have to keep
  making hard decisions. Like, I remember I needed a bridge round,
  and people were like, "Of course," because they were seeing —

Shontell: — explain what a bridge round is.

Kadakia: I needed an extra $300,000 to stitch
  between where I was with my capital and where I wanted to go, and
  I wasn't ready to go into a big round. And so it was awesome
  because I think people were just like, "Your progress!" I always
  say investors invest in lines, not dots. I was giving them so
  many dots that were so much better than the last time I had seen
  them, and I was keeping people in the loop. For me, the
  reservation number and our revenue trajectory — I remember just
  sending charts and the hockey stick to people. So many of my
  investors, I remember when they were like, "When you texted me
  that, it was like, oh my God."


  I remember sitting down with Hayley from Birchbox, and I was
  like, "Here's what it looks like." She was just like, "Show me
  that again." I feel like that was when I knew we had cracked
  something that was really special. That was January 2014.

Shontell: I had investors emailing me saying,
  "I've seen you write about Payal before. Do you know her, and can
  you intro me?" You had a serious demand that cooked up. VCs are
  like, "Oh, what's the next shiny thing? I have to get into this
  hot deal." You were — you became that hot deal. What was it like
  when you hit that inflection point? Do you notice a change? How
  do you deal with that as a founder?

Kadakia: I did notice the change. I remember
  going out to raise my series A and ending up with multiple term
  sheets when I had gone to Silicon Valley probably four times at
  that point and coming back with nothing. This is when I met
  Fritz, and I was like, "Fritz is the type of person I want
  involved in my company."

Shontell: Fritz Lanman is your now CEO.

Kadakia: He's the CEO of ClassPass. It was one
  of those moments when I met Fritz I knew he believed in my
  mission. I was meeting all these people who I know were now
  chasing me because they saw traction, but I didn't know if they
  believed in my mission. It's really hard to figure that out in
  three days when everyone's like, "Let's sign a term sheet
  tomorrow." I had that struggle, and I remember Fritz and I
  chatted about it. He was very much helping me with the fund
  raise. I was like, "I just don't know if I trust any of these
  folks. I don't know them, and I want the chance to get to know
  them." I had multiple data points with them, the same way they
  have multiple data points on me — it didn't feel fair. Fritz was
  like, "I think I can get you the capital," so he ended up leading
  my series A and getting more involved in the company, and I said
  no to some really great people who actually got involved in the
  company in later rounds because I had enough data on them.


  How ClassPass figured out how to price its product after a few
  stumbles that made users scream



Sarah
  Jacobs


Shontell: You've had to make some tough
  decisions throughout the course of the company's growth and
  history. One of them is the pricing has changed. That hasn't
  always been well-received by users. There's been some screaming
  on Twitter and things like that. There was this $99 beautiful
  price point for a long time where — was it unlimited classes, or
  am I making that up?

Kadakia: It was unlimited for a bit.

Shontell: For $99, you could get unlimited
  classes. People were going to literally a class every day
  sometimes. It was a huge discount. Like I said, $30 could get you
  one spin class, normally, and then you changed prices sort of
  seemingly out of the blue. How did you make that decision, why
  did you make it, and were there mistakes made?

Kadakia: It was $99 for 10 in the beginning, and
  we were getting data and people were only going to five. That
  was, like, the original number. And it was this amazing thing
  where my CFO and I would always chat about this. He was like,
  "People die for engagement. We have too much engagement now."


  It was this interesting thing where everything I had set out in
  the world to do, from this moment I started this company, was
  coming true from a product and consumer perspective, but it was
  breaking the business, right? In the sense of, we didn't know how
  much people would work out. No one had ever done this before. I
  had no blueprint. The only way to actually test this was in a
  real-life test.


  And so the first thing we did is we increased the price. We
  didn't know where usage would settle, and it wasn't the right
  price, and then we actually realize as we were increasing price
  of unlimited I was shutting out a part of the market that I
  actually wanted in the market. This product was meant for people
  to be accessible, and we were making it less accessible over
  time, so then we started launching the lower tiers. And as we
  started launching the lower tiers, the unlimited tiers
  deteriorated even more in terms of its profit.

Shontell: By lower tier, you mean a cheaper
  amount for fewer classes.

Kadakia: Exactly. Some people, they were like,
  "I want to go to class," but they were like, "I can do this for
  $50." But when unlimited started going, we had to keep increasing
  the price on that — the value proposition was changing, and the
  type of customer was changing. That's when we saw the success of
  the lower-tier products and we were like, "OK, these are great,"
  people love them as much as they love the unlimited product, and
  so we had to make the hard decision to sunset our unlimited plan.


  But that being said, we also made sure that — two things I would
  say: We made sure that we grandfathered a lot of them into having
  10 classes per month because we wanted them to keep trying it,
  and we also introduced bundle so you could keep going to class.
  And we made the UI as simple as possible, and we just launched
  video on demand, too. That was a very important thing for me as a
  founder to be like, "We're going to give you a way to work out
  every day," because that's what our premise is. We don't want to
  say, "To be fit, you need to have lots of money." That is not the
  premise we started the company under.

Shontell: You go through all this. You've
  changed the price. You figure it out. You've iterated. And how
  many markets are you in?

Kadakia: We're in 39 cities globally.

Shontell: OK. And how many users? Can you share
  any metrics?

Kadakia: We're past 30 million reservations
  since we launched ClassPass, so 2013.


How to combat a bunch of copycats that undercut you on
  price

  playful swing at her startup's Chicago launch

Shontell: That's tremendous growth. So much so
  that a slew of copycats came out.

Kadakia: Yeah. That was an interesting phase.

Shontell: There's all these people. So how do
  you deal with that as a founder when you've got something
  successful that's working, that's hot, and then all these
  copycats come out and undercut your price, or try to?

Kadakia: It was an interesting phase in the
  company. I believe you win the race by looking forward, not
  behind. It became a little hard. There was this phase where I
  feel like every day I would get to my desk and the team was
  talking about it, and people were talking about it, and so we
  were like, "Alright, this is ours to lose." That's how I felt. I
  think we kind of knew we had to kind of take on the market and
  expand rapidly, and we did that. We went to 20 cities in a matter
  of six months.

Shontell: Wow.

Kadakia: Yeah.

Shontell: Are you guys making money?

Kadakia: We're on track to be profitable.

Shontell: How do you balance that? How do you
  balance how much to charge someone versus what it does to your
  bottom line, and how do you decide when to toggle things?

Kadakia: I think we've now priced our product in
  a way that is sustainable for the company and it's great value
  for our customers, and at the same time we're also innovating on
  the partner side to partner with them in terms of dynamic
  pricing. We've always had this one payment, one price for every
  class that we've paid the studios. We've also started figuring
  out what are ways we can drive them more traffic with different
  prices, so we're also experimenting on that side of it, but at
  the end of the day, for us it's really — we've now realized what
  the usage sort of looks like on the plans that are capped, which
  are easier than having, obviously, an unlimited number of classes
  that you can go to.

Shontell: One other thing: As you are growing, a
  lot of people ask the question of Groupon. They say this has been
  done before, where you get this great bargain to go into a new
  place. Groupon did it. It was very successful for a while. It
  went public, and then all of a sudden it didn't work. Was that a
  fair comparison to make, or did you guys take anything that
  Groupon did and learn from it?

Kadakia: The member we were marketing to was
  somebody who was scared to walk into a fitness studio. They
  didn't know the price of a class. Yes, it's good that a lot of
  people do, but actually, the market we were actually creating
  were people who had really never done this before. We wanted to
  make sure that this was seamless, easy. We were dealing with the
  excess capacity, not your prime-time spots that we're going to
  push out your loyal customers. That was something that we thought
  about from the beginning. And the other thing we thought about
  was the lifestyle of it.


  How a CEO decides to stop being CEO



ClassPass


Shontell: Recently you made the tough decision
  to not give up your baby — you're still very much involved in
  ClassPass — but you did step away from the CEO role. How did you
  arrive at that decision?

Kadakia: I think founders, as they go through
  their company, the founder/CEO role just fundamentally changes.
  One of the comparisons I always love to make is dance companies
  have an artistic director and an executive director, and they're
  not the same person. I'm a very creative person, and I think
  about my product from that place of creativity and wanting to
  improve people's lives. I went to MIT, I worked at Bain, but my
  magic is in my artist side, and I kept feeling like I was pushing
  away from it. And that's actually what built this company. Every
  single day, I was getting further and further away. You have to
  build a team to be able to go back to that, and that's like one
  of my advisers always said: "Your freedom to create lies in
  people." I looked around and I was like, "Who are the folks that
  I have around me?" And Fritz and I have had such a great
  relationship, and I trust him 100%. He knows exactly what I want
  to build. I don't know if I would make the decision if it was
  anyone else. And so it's been great, and he's been such a great
  partner, and I love what I'm doing now.

Shontell: It's got to be, still, a hard,
  emotional decision to make. This is a role that you're stepping
  back from when you've had it for years. You've grown this thing
  from the ground up. The CEO title, there's something that comes
  with that.

Kadakia: The impact we have on people's lives to
  me is more important than any title anyone can carry and the one
  thing, the only thing, and I thought a lot about this was: I want
  little girls to believe that they can be CEOs. The best thing I
  could do, though, is be an empowered female and authentically
  doing what I love. That's the message I want to send, not "Go and
  do things you don't like because that's what the world needs,"
  right? To me, I will be a stronger person if I'm moving forward,
  doing the work I want, and continue to drive force the purpose
  that I want to create versus doing what other people think I
  should be doing, which is never a way to live.

Shontell: What you're saying, too, is that the
  role of CEO changes as your company changes. It's very different
  when you're starting out to when you have hundreds of people that
  you're managing. What were some of the things that you found that
  you didn't like?

Kadakia: I felt like my day just became a lot of
  meetings, and I wasn't finding time to actually brainstorm and
  build my product and think creatively about what we were building
  and take those chances on innovation. And I knew I was the
  lifeline to that — if that made sense — and I wanted to free
  myself up to do it.

Shontell: What are you doing now day to day?
  What's the role of executive chairman?

Kadakia: I think it varies for every executive
  chairman that's out there. I think as founder, for me it's about
  focusing on the product and the member experience. We just
  launched some really cool stuff. Now you can go back to studios
  like the small premium, there's a video product that we just
  launched, and that I'm continuously focused on and what we're
  going to be doing in the digital era, which is so unbelievable
  and growing right now. Just how — we were just talking about this
  — how digital and video is becoming such a prominent part in
  people's lives. I think there's a really great big fitness angle
  and a platform angle for ClassPass to have there.

Shontell: Are you going to stick cameras in
  studios and let people stream it at home or what kind of videos?

Kadakia: We're exploring a lot of things. I
  think the No. 1 thing I would say is our vision is to make that
  studio experience come to your home because it's really
  important. We know how great these studios are, and not everyone
  can access them. I think this is a part of who we've always been.
  It's great for the New Yorker who's next to five barre studios
  and two spin places, but what about someone who's in the middle
  of Idaho? They can't do it.

Shontell: As really a first-time tech founder,
  what were you surprised to learn, and what was the hardest part?

Kadakia: Some of the things that I've fallen in
  love with, which I think I wasn't expecting, were things like UX
  and design. I actually think it's such a new field that five
  years ago I don't think people were studying user experience,
  right? I think it's so cool that we have to now think about
  what's going on in the screen. Every inch of it kind of matters,
  so that's just been interesting for me as a founder to dive into.


  I think being in New York and building a company here was a
  complete, interesting learning lesson, and to be honest, to see
  the New York tech scene completely change and transform over
  these five years — I couldn't count the number of entrepreneurs I
  knew on my one hand five years ago. Now it's unbelievable how
  many people there are, and everyone's working at startups.
