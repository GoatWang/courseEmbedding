Overview
The Core Fixed Income strategy seeks to capture market inefficiencies predominantly through sector allocation and security selection decisions in the context of robust risk management controls. We seek to minimize volatility through strict limits on relative sector exposures and duration decisions and manage idiosyncratic risk through individual issuer limits. Through our consistently applied philosophy and process, we seek to generate above market returns over market cycles with volatility of performance at or below our primary index.
Investment Philosophy
INCOME ADVANTAGE

Seek to maintain a durable income advantage as compounding interest is an essential component of value-added fixed income investment returns.

FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH & MEAN REVERSION

Independent, in-depth fundamental research helps us capture an income advantage and have confidence in our investment decisions during periods of volatility. Mean reversion is a critical component in developing investment ideas and maintaining a sell discipline.

AVOID ASYMMETRIC RISK

Given that fixed income instruments may provide limited upside and maximum downside return potential, careful attention to issue- and issuer-level analysis is critical to portfolio construction.

EMPHASIZE RISK MANAGEMENT

Control risk by using a consistent, disciplined investment process as well as maintaining strict limits on individual issuer exposure, sector allocation, and duration positioning.

LONG-TERM ORIENTATION

Focusing on a long-term investment horizon enables us to capture market inefficiencies.

It is the return in excess of the compensation for the risk borne, and thus commonly used to assess active managers’ performances.

Risk Adjusted Return - A concept that refines an investment's return by measuring how much risk is involved in producing that return, which is generally expressed as a number or rating. Risk-adjusted returns are applied to individual securities and investment funds and portfolios.
Barclays US 1-3 Year Government/Credit Index - The Barclays 1-3 Year U.S. Government/Credit Index was known as the Lehman Brothers Government/Credit Bond Index, which composed of the Treasury Bond and Agency Bond Indices, the 1-3 year U.S. Government Index, and all publicly issued, fixed-rate, non-convertible investment grade corporate debt.

Russell Microcap Index - The Russell Microcap Index is a capitalization weighted index of 2000 small cap and micro cap stocks that captures the smallest 1000 companies in the Russell 2000, plus 1000 smaller U.S.-based listed stocks. The broad index is designed to present an unbiased collection of the smallest tradable securities that still meet exchange listing requirements, so over-the-counter (OTC) stocks and pink sheet securities are excluded. The Index is recalculated annually to prevent growing stocks from distorting index performance, and to include new entrants.

Overview
HighMark’s Large Cap Core Equity strategy seeks to outperform the Russell 1000 Index by constructing a diversified portfolio using a systematic investment process that combines analysis of economic and market forces, individual stock analysis and risk management, and efficient strategy implementation. The core of our process is information-based investing, which uses signals from the activity of informed market participants to assess potential for market outperformance.
Investment Philosophy
INFORMATION-BASED INVESTING

Identify knowledgeable market participants with established insight into a company or segment of the market and monitor the activities of these ‘unique market participants’ to provide signals of future performance.


EMPHASIZE RISK MANAGEMENT

Portfolio construction and ongoing risk monitoring/ management are key areas of focus. Controlling beta protects alpha.


FOCUS ON BREADTH

A broad range of diverse sources of information produces more consistent results than a focus on a narrow set of company characteristics.


LISTEN TO WHAT THE MARKET IS TELLING YOU

Be adaptable to the prevailing market environment.

Morningstar Ratings disclosure
Morningstar Ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance. The Morningstar RatingTM is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with the Fund's 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) periods.
Morningstar Ratings metrics. Morningstar Ratings are based solely on a proprietary mathematical formula based on measures of risk and performance that it recalculates each month. The ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's or ETF’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) emphasizing downward variations and rewarding consistency. Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.
Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Current fund performance may be higher or lower, which may change a fund’s star rating. Despite high ratings, funds may have experienced negative performance during the period. Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.
Ratings (with load) reflect class-specific sales charges, if any. A class share ratings no longer reflect sales charges. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
