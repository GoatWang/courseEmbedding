Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.




StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

Vanguard Equity Index Group
			
Product management

Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap Fund seeks a tax-efficient total return consisting of long-term capital appreciation and nominal current income. The fund tracks the investment performance of the Standard & Poor’s SmallCap 600 Index—an unmanaged benchmark representing small-capitalization U.S. stocks. The advisor uses portfolio optimization techniques to select a sample of stocks that, in aggregate, reflect the characteristics of the benchmark index. Vanguard uses proprietary software to implement trading decisions that accommodate cash flow and maintain close correlation with index characteristics. In addition, a disciplined sell process minimizes the realization of net capital gains and may include the realization of losses to offset unavoidable gains. The experience and stability of Vanguard’s Equity Index Group have permitted continuous refinement of indexing techniques designed to minimize tracking error and provide tax-efficient returns.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
The Fund's bottom-up stock-picking approach aims to identify companies that the manager expects to achieve growth that exceeds the average of all publicly traded companies in the U.S. over the long term.



The Approach
We believe small-cap markets are becoming increasingly inefficient, so we seek to exploit this inefficiency with intensive fundamental research by searching for companies with experienced and proven management teams whose interests are aligned with inves tors.



The Features
Led by two portfolio managers with more than 35 years of collective investing experience and supported by a focused team of small-cap analysts. The team holds approximately 1,000 company meetings per year to construct a high conviction diversified portfo lio of quality small cap companies.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of another Fund class. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower . The share class has no sales charge.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Investments in for eign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Market conditions may limit the ability to generate tax losses or t o generate dividend income taxed at favorable tax rates. The Fund's ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose  money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of another Fund class. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower . The share class has no sales charge.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, higher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Investments in for eign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Market conditions may limit the ability to generate tax losses or t o generate dividend income taxed at favorable tax rates. The Fund's ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose  money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not possible to  invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.

5. The Morningstar Small Growth Category includes funds that invest primarily in U.S. small-cap companies with growth characteristics such as high earnings growth and high price ratios.
6. Alpha measures risk-adjusted performance, showing excess return delivered at the same risk level as the benchmark. Beta measures the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market. R-Squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movement that  can be explained by the general movement of the market. Standard deviation measures the historic volatility of a fund. Sharpe Ratio uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.
7. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
The Fund seeks to achieve long-term after-tax total return. The Fund looks to meet its objective by investing in what the managers, in their opinion, identify as companies high in quality.



The Approach
Stock selection is based primarily on a bottom-up process that identifies stocks through fundamental research. Managers consider a number of factors including company's earnings or cash flow capabilities, financial strength, the strength of the company's  business franchises and management team, sustainability of a company's competitiveness and estimates of the company's net value. The Fund seeks to minimize taxable distributions.



The Features
A team driven investment process led by an experienced portfolio manager focusing on stock selection as the primary driver of alpha1 generation. The Fund may also provide geographic, issuer and industry diversification2 across small-companies wit hin a risk managed framework, investing primarily in U.S. and foreign developed markets. The Fund may also invest in emerging market countries.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Prior to 8/7/15, Fund was called Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Small-Cap Value Fund and employed a different investment strategy. Please see prospectus for more details. Max Sales Charge: 5.75%.

About Risk:

No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other  investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

PRICE AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Price and distributions

NAVFor funds with a fluctuating price per share, the net asset value (NAV) is the market value of a mutual fund's total assets, minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH






Dividend yieldThe annual rate of return on a share of stock, determined by dividing the annual dividend by its current share price. In a stock mutual fund, this figure represents the average dividend yield of the stocks held by the fund.

Fees and minimums
Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.

Please note that a Portfolio that invests in other Portfolios typically does not hold securities directly. As such, "Top  Holdings" information for such a Portfolio represents "Top Holdings" information of underlying Portfolios.Please click here to access Top Holdings as of a more recent month end.Holdings are subject to change.Numbers may not total 100% due to rounding. 
Portfolio RisksEquity Market Risk: Even a long-term investment approach cannot guarantee a profit. Economic, market, political, and issuer-specific conditions and events will cause the value of equity securities, and the Tax-Managed U.S. Small Cap Portfolio that owns them, to rise or fall. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.
Small Company Risk: Securities of small companies are often less liquid than those of large companies and this could make it difficult to sell a small company security at a desired time or price. As a result, small company stocks may fluctuate relatively more in price. In general, smaller capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than larger companies to adverse business or economic developments and they may have more limited resources.
Tax-Management Strategy Risk: The tax-management strategies may alter investment decisions and affect portfolio holdings, when compared to those of non-tax managed mutual funds. The Advisor anticipates that performance of the Tax-Managed U.S. Small Cap Portfolio may deviate from that of non-tax managed mutual funds.
Derivatives Risk: Derivatives are instruments, such as futures contracts, whose value is derived from that of other assets, rates or indices. The use of derivatives for non-hedging purposes may be considered to carry more risk than other types of investments. When the Tax-Managed U.S. Small Cap Portfolio uses derivatives, the Portfolio will be directly exposed to the risks of those derivatives. Derivative instruments are subject to a number of risks including counterparty, liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, and the risk of improper valuation. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Portfolio could lose more than the principal amount invested.
Securities Lending Risk: Securities lending involves the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. As a result, the Tax-Managed U.S. Small Cap Portfolio may lose money and there may be a delay in recovering the loaned securities. The Portfolio could also lose money if it does not recover the securities and/or the value of the collateral falls, including the value of investments made with cash collateral. Securities lending also may have certain adverse tax consequences.
Cyber Security Risk: The Tax-Managed U.S. Small Cap Portfolio’s and its service providers’ use of internet, technology and information systems may expose the Portfolio to potential risks linked to cyber security breaches of those technological or information systems. Cyber security breaches, amongst other things, could allow an unauthorized party to gain access to proprietary information, customer data, or fund assets, or cause the Portfolio and/or its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality.

Important information regarding U.S. Equities (including Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Funds)


Important information regarding asset classes






Fund  objectives, risks, charges and expenses should be carefully considered  before investing. A summary prospectus, if available, or a prospectus containing this and other important  information can be obtained by calling 800-787-7354 or by visiting the prospectus and reports page to download one. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Please remember that all investments carry some level of risk, including the potential loss of principal invested. They do not typically grow at an even rate of return and may experience negative growth. As with any type of portfolio structuring, attempting to reduce risk and increase return could, at certain times, unintentionally reduce returns.
Diversification and multi-asset solutions do not assure a profit and do not protect against loss in declining markets.
