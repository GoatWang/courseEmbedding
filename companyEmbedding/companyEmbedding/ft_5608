                    What can I say about Roanoke but good things!  It is a great small city that is warm and friendly and easy to get around in.  Roanoke has something for everyone, you can live downtown or not, there are all kinds of neighborhoods in all price ranges with tons of fun things to do from the Greenway to Market Square. I can't think of another city I would rather call home than Roanoke.
