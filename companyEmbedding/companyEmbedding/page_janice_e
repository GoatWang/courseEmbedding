Marketing Promotions
Here are samples and templates of sweepstakes promotions, house ads, email promotionals and contests, as well as print ads for the AARP Member Event publication.
















































Editorial Billboards
AARP actively supported their editorial content by featuring new content daily through rotating billboards on the homepage. Here are some of my sample treatments.  
























Web Page Design
These are design solutions that addressed complex business, marketing and user needs. Some of these designs are templates and visual mock-ups for client selection and approval and some are designs that were signed off and published.
















































Posters
These posters were done for AARP Member Events held in Chicago, Las Vegas and New Orleans. The smaller posters were created for the University of Kentucky School of Fine Arts. 




































Interactive Product Design
These are some games and widgets that I designed to increase engagement with users and provide visual ways to share content on the AARP website.






















































Web Banners




































Just for Fun
Some of these creatives were school projects done in Illustrator. Others are just playing around and having fun.




































Textile Designs
These designs were created on fabric using the method of silkscreen but I also painted designs using gouache on paper.
