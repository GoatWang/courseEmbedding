 Innovative Precast



Half a Century of Innovative Precast Backed by Superior Service

The Smith-Midland Corporation entered the marketplace in 1960 as the Smith Cattleguard Company. From the beginning we provided innovative, high quality precast concrete products backed by superior service. Although the name has changed and the products we offer have increased ten-fold, we have never deviated from the Standards on which our success was built -innovation, quality and service. That’s what we mean by Excellence in Precast Concrete, and we welcome the opportunity to share that excellence with you.

  
Ashley B. Smith, President

In 1960, David G. Smith produced the first Smith-Midland precast product, the Smith-Cattleguard in Midland, Virginia. Over the years, as we met the challenges of the times, we added a full line of farm products along with J-J Hooks safety barriers, utility products, Easi-Set and Easi-Span precast concrete buildings, SlenderWall, Sierra Wall, Beach Prisms and other custom designed products. Our facilities expanded from a small farm outbuilding to a modern complex of office and production buildings on a 20 acre site, with a second manufacturing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina. In 1985, in celebration of a quarter century of progress and to better represent the diversity of our products, the name of the company was changed from Smith Cattleguard Company to Smith-Midland Corporation and Smith-Carolina Corporation. Another milestone in the growth of the companies came in December 1995 when the private held corporation made a public stock offering and is now a publicly traded corporation with over 50 years of history. In keeping with our tradition of growth, we added a third precast plant in South Carolina in 2016 to extend our reach down the length of the East Coast, Smith-Columbia.

Your liability risk when hiring Ashley B Smith



Kentucky does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance. Regardless, it is advisable to hire contractors with active policies for both forms of insurance. Be sure to request a copy of the insurance certificates for your records.











Financial recourse when hiring Ashley B Smith



Kentucky does not require contractors to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file complaints with the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection department.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor
