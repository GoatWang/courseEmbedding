Homeowner Resources
At Ocwen, we know that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution for homeowners facing financial challenges. That’s why we work directly with our customers to explore a full range of options to help them save money and stay in their homes. Independent data confirms that a large majority of the homeowners we help with a modified or an adjusted loan, succeed in turning their situation around.
Mortgage Assistance Options
For our customers who qualify, we offer solutions that include changing one or more terms of a loan – from lowering the interest rate, to adjusting the loan balance, to spreading payments over a longer term. We may even offer the option of lowering the principal balance.
Click to learn more about our mortgage assistance options.

Alternatives to Foreclosure
For homeowners who simply cannot afford to stay in their homes, or may want to move on from the property, we offer options that enable them to exit ownership without facing the stigma of foreclosure.

The VP of Business Intelligence and Data Management oversees reporting, data warehousing, analytics and architecture, providing IT strategy. The Network Administration group specializes in network security, while also covering data storage and telecommunications. The Business Analysis and MIS Reporting groups work together in support of applications and databases. The IT Financial Systems group is responsible for the support of financial applications and systems used across the company.

The company relies primarily on Oracle technologies for business process management.

Ocwen Financial recently acquired Homeward Residential towards the end of 2012. The company is in the process of integrating Homeward Residential and when the initiative is complete, Homeward Residential's operations will be overseen by Ocwen. Ocwen recently acquired Liberty Home Equity Solutions, a former business line for Genworth Financial, and Residential Capital LLC (ResCap) a former business line of Ally Financial. Integration of these two business lines are on hold until they can separate their systems and infrastructure from their respective parent companies.
