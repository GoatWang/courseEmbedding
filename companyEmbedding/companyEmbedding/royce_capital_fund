Brendan HartmanPortfolio Manager4+ Years on Fund†Jim StoeffelLead Portfolio Manager2+ Years on Fund†




"The micro-cap universe offers plenty of opportunities for us to find companies that are lightly researched or mispriced. Using multiple approaches gives us exposure to the entire asset class while our discipline keeps us focused on the fundamental business strengths that we think can create strong long-term performance."—Jim Stoeffel

Important Performance and Expense Information


 All performance information reflects past performance, is presented on a total return basis, reflects the reinvestment of distributions, and does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Current month-end performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted and may be obtained at www.roycefunds.com. The Fund's total returns do not reflect any deduction for charges or expenses of the variable contracts investing in the Fund. Operating expenses reflect the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the Investment Class as of the Fund's most current prospectus and include management fees and other expenses.

Morningstar Style Mapas of 03/31/17











The Morningstar Style Map is the Morningstar Style Box with the center 75% of fund holdings plotted as the Morningstar Ownership Zone. The Morningstar Style Box is designed to reveal a fund's investment strategy. The Morningstar Ownership Zone provides detail about a portfolio's investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. The Ownership Zone is derived by plotting each stock in the portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the Fund's assets while the plot point in the middle represents the weighted average of its holdings. Over time, the shape and location of a fund's ownership zone may vary.

Important Disclosure Information






This material is not authorized for distribution unless preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefuly before investing or sending money.  The Fund invests primarily in micro-cap stocks, which may involve considerably more risk than investments in securities of larger-cap companies. (Please see "Primary Risks for Fund Investors" in the prospectus.) The Fund’s broadly diversified portfolio does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities (measured at the time of investment), which may involve political, economic, currency, and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments. (Please see "Investing in Foreign Securities" in the prospectus.)Sector weightings are determined using the Global Industry Classification Standard ("GICS"). GICS was developed by, and is the exclusive property of, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("S&P") and MSCI Inc. ("MSCI"). GICS is the trademark of S&P and MSCI. "Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)" and "GICS Direct" are service marks of S&P and MSCI. The Price-Earnings, or P/E, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its trailing 12-month earnings-per-share (EPS). The Fund's P/E ratio calculation excludes companies with zero or negative earnings. The Price-to-Book, or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Standard deviation is a statistical measure within which a fund's total returns have varied over time. The greater the standard deviation, the greater a fund's volatility.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




The Fund invests primarily in small-cap stocks, which may involve considerably more risk than investments in securities of larger-cap companies. The Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in a limited number of stocks, which may involve considerably more risk than more broadly diversified portfolio because a decline in the value of any one of these stocks would cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater degree. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities (measured at the time of investment), which may involve political, economic, currency, and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments.

Statement of Additional Information















IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These portfolios are available as investment options under a variable annuity or variable life contract. Shares of the portfolios are offered only to insurance company separate accounts that fund certain variable annuity or life contracts. These portfolios may not be available in all states and may only be offered in certain variable products. Please refer to the prospectuses. Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% IRS penalty charge and/or surrender charges. Investments in a variable annuity are subject to market risks, including loss of principal. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the insurer.
VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SOLD BY PROSPECTUS ONLY. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES CONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO. FOR A FREE PROSPECTUS ON THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO, PLEASE CLICK ON THE PROSPECTUS LINK. AN INVESTOR SHOULD READ THE PROSPECTUSES CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING.

The Morningstar Style Map is the Morningstar Style Box with the center 75% of fund holdings plotted as the Morningstar Ownership Zone. The Morningstar Style Box is designed to reveal a fund's investment strategy. The Morningstar Ownership Zone provides detail about a portfolio's investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. The Ownership Zone is derived by plotting each stock in the portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the Fund's assets while the plot point in the middle represents the weighted average of its holdings. Over time, the shape and location of a fund's ownership zone may vary.

Important Disclosure Information






This material is not authorized for distribution unless preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefuly before investing or sending money.  The Fund invests primarily in small-cap stocks, which may involve considerably more risk than investments in securities of larger-cap companies. (Please see "Primary Risks for Fund Investors" in the prospectus.) As of 06/30/17 the Fund invested a significant portion of its assets in a limited number of stocks, which may involve considerably more risk than more broadly diversified portfolio because a decline in the value of any one of these stocks would cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater degree. (Please see "Primary Risks for Fund Investors" in the prospectus.) The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities (measured at the time of investment), which may involve political, economic, currency, and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments. (Please the "Investing in Foreign Securities" in the prospectus.)Sector weightings are determined using the Global Industry Classification Standard ("GICS"). GICS was developed by, and is the exclusive property of, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("S&P") and MSCI Inc. ("MSCI"). GICS is the trademark of S&P and MSCI.

The Price-Earnings, or P/E, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its trailing 12-month earnings-per-share (EPS). The Fund's P/E ratio calculation excludes companies with zero or negative earnings. The Price-to-Book, or P/B, Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its book value per share. Standard deviation is a statistical measure within which a fund's total returns have varied over time. The greater the standard deviation, the greater a fund's volatility.

Overview 










highlights





One of the only variable annuity products dedicated to investing in micro-cap stocks (generally market caps up to $1 billion) 
Core approach that combines multiple investment themes and offers wide exposure to microcap stocks by investing in companies with strong fundamentals and/or prospects selling at prices that Royce believes do not fully reflect these attributes 
Approach emphasizes the intersection of valuation with fundamental strength and/or excellent growth or turnaround potential

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




The Fund invests primarily in micro-cap stocks, which may involve considerably more risk than investments in securities of larger-cap companies. The Fund’s broadly diversified portfolio does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in foreign securities (measured at the time of investment), which may involve political, economic, currency, and other risks not encountered in U.S. investments.

Statement of Additional Information















IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These portfolios are available as investment options under a variable annuity or variable life contract. Shares of the portfolios are offered only to insurance company separate accounts that fund certain variable annuity or life contracts. These portfolios may not be available in all states and may only be offered in certain variable products. Please refer to the prospectuses. Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% IRS penalty charge and/or surrender charges. Investments in a variable annuity are subject to market risks, including loss of principal. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the insurer.
VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SOLD BY PROSPECTUS ONLY. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES CONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO. FOR A FREE PROSPECTUS ON THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO, PLEASE CLICK ON THE PROSPECTUS LINK. AN INVESTOR SHOULD READ THE PROSPECTUSES CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.
