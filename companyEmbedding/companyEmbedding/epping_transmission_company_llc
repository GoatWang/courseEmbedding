DALLAS, July 29, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Midstream Partners, LLC ("Summit Investments"), the privately held company that owns and controls the general partner of Summit Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:   SMLP) and also owns a 56.7% limited partner interest in SMLP, today provided a commercial update for its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Meadowlark Midstream Company, LLC ("Meadowlark") and Epping Transmission Company, LLC ("Epping Transco").  Meadowlark is composed of the Divide Crude Oil & Water Gathering System (the "Divide System") and the Polar Crude Oil & Water Gathering System (the "Polar System"), both of which are located in the Bakken Shale Play in North Dakota, and the Niobrara Gathering & Processing System which is located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Weld County, CO.  Epping Transco is a newly formed subsidiary that will own and operate the Little Muddy Interconnect, described below.
Epping Transco announced today that it has reached an agreement with North Dakota Pipeline Company LLC, an affiliate of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. ("Enbridge"), on a new crude oil interconnect agreement pursuant to which Epping Transco will interconnect with and deliver certain of the crude oil gathered on Meadowlark's Polar and Divide systems into Enbridge's North Dakota System (the "Little Muddy Interconnect").  The Little Muddy Interconnect will provide customers on the Polar and Divide systems with increased optionality in accessing downstream markets with up to 55,000 barrels per day ("BPD") of incremental pipeline throughput capacity.
In connection with the Little Muddy Interconnect and the Basin Transload interconnect announced in June 2014, Meadowlark will expand its Epping Crude Oil Storage Facility ("Epping Storage") and Divide Crude Oil Storage Facility ("Divide Storage"), to offer additional crude oil storage services to its customers. Epping Storage will receive crude oil from the Polar and Divide systems and will also include a truck unloading rack.  Divide Storage will receive crude oil from the Divide System and will also include a multi-bay truck unloading rack.  Epping Storage and Divide Storage will each have 75,000 barrels of crude oil storage capacity, initially, and both facilities will have the ability to accommodate additional crude oil storage tanks for future potential expansions.   Both facilities are expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2015.  Customers of Epping Storage will have the option to access the COLT Hub rail terminal or Enbridge's North Dakota Pipeline System.  Customers of Divide Storage will have the option to access the COLT Hub rail terminal, Basin Transload's Columbus rail terminal, or Enbridge's North Dakota System (through Epping Storage).
Steve Newby, President and CEO of Summit Investments commented, "Our commercial team continues to find ways to enhance both the operating capability of our Bakken crude oil gathering systems and our service offerings for our customers.  With today's announcement, we add another delivery outlet for our Bakken customers to utilize, which provides them with improved reliability and greater flexibility to access the most favorable crude oil markets and optimize returns."  
"I am also excited to announce that we are enhancing our service offering in the basin by developing new crude oil storage capacity at our Epping and Divide locations.  These projects add another level of service that we can offer to our customers to facilitate their drilling programs, provide storage capacity, and ensure access to multiple crude oil markets."
About Summit Midstream Partners, LLC
Summit Midstream Partners, LLC ("Summit Investments") indirectly owns a 56.7% limited partner interest in SMLP and indirectly owns and controls the general partner of SMLP, Summit Midstream GP, LLC, which has sole responsibility for conducting the business and managing the operations of SMLP.  Summit Investments owns, operates and is developing various crude oil, associated natural gas, and water-related midstream energy infrastructure assets in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and in the DJ Niobrara Shale in Colorado. Summit Investments is also developing natural gas gathering and condensate stabilization infrastructure in the Utica Shale in southeastern Ohio under a joint venture agreement with affiliates of MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. and The Energy & Minerals Group.  Summit Investments is a privately held company owned by members of management, funds controlled by Energy Capital Partners II, LLC, and certain of its affiliates.

With
respect to the securities to be offered by the Registrants, there
are being registered hereunder a presently indeterminate number of
common units representing limited partner interests in Summit
Midstream Partners, LP and an indeterminate principal amount
of debt securities of Summit Midstream Partners, LLC, Summit
Midstream Holdings, LLC and Summit Midstream Finance Corp.,
which may be offered and sold in such amount as shall result in an
aggregate offering price not to exceed $1,500,000,000. This
registration statement also covers an indeterminate amount of
securities as may be issued in exchange for, or upon conversion or
exercise of, as the case may be, the securities registered
hereunder.

(2)

With
respect to the securities to be offered by the Registrants, the
proposed maximum offering price per unit for each class of
securities and the proposed maximum aggregate offering price for
each class of securities to be registered is not specified pursuant
to General Instruction II.D. of Form S-3.

(3)

If any
debt securities are issued at an original issue discount, then the
offering price of those debt securities shall be in an amount that
will result in an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed
$1,500,000,000, less the dollar amount of any registered securities
previously issued.

(4)

No
separate consideration will be received for any guarantee of debt
securities; accordingly, pursuant to Rule 457(n) under the
Securities Act, no separate registration fee is
required.

(5)

Estimated
solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee pursuant
to Rule 457(o) under the Securities Act. With respect to the
securities to be offered by the Registrants, in no event will the
aggregate initial offering price of all securities offered from
time to time pursuant to this Registration Statement exceed
$1,500,000,000. Any securities registered hereunder may be sold
separately or together with other securities registered
hereunder.

(6)

Calculated
in accordance with Rule 457(o) under the Securities
Act.

(7)

Represents
the resale of common units. Includes an additional 930,822 common
units to be registered from the previous filing of the Registration
Statement on October 4, 2016. Pursuant to Rule 416(a)
under the Securities Act, the number of common units being
registered on behalf of the selling unitholders shall be adjusted
to include any additional common units that may become issuable as
a result of any unit distribution, split, combination or similar
transaction.

(8)

With
respect to the sale of common units by the selling unitholders, the
proposed maximum offering price per common unit will be determined
from time to time by the selling unitholders in connection with,
and at the time of, the sale by the selling unitholders of the
common units registered hereunder. Relates solely to the 930,822
additional common units being registered since the previous filing
of the Registration Statement on October 4, 2016. Summit
Midstream Partners, LP previously calculated the proposed
maximum offering price per common unit using an estimated price of
$23.40, which was the average high and low sales price of Summit
Midstream Partners, LP's common units on September 30,
2016.

(9)

Estimated
solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee pursuant
to Rule 457(c) under the Securities Act. The price is based on
the average of the high and low sale prices for our common units on
November 4, 2016, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.
Includes $837,027,547 related to 35,770,408 common units registered
on behalf of the selling unitholders in the previous filing of the
Registration Statement on October 4, 2016 at a price of $23.40
(see footnote 8).

(10)

Calculated
in accordance with Rule 457(c) under the Securities
Act.

(11)

Pursuant
to Rule 415(a)(6) under the Securities Act, a portion of the
securities being registered herein are carried over, as unsold
securities, from an existing Registration Statement on
Form S-3 (File No. 333-191493) of the same registrants
initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
October 1, 2013. Because a filing fee for $91,481 previously
was paid with respect to such unsold securities, the filing fee due
under this Registration Statement is $181,655. The Registrant
previously paid $179,380 of the required registration fee in
connection with the previous filing of this Registration Statement
on October 4, 2016. In accordance with Rule 415(a)(6),
the Registrant may continue to offer and sell securities under this
prior Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File
No. 333-191493) to the time this Registration Statement
becomes effective, including during any applicable grace period
afforded by Rule 415(a)(5).

*

The
companies listed on the next page in the Table of Additional
Registrant Guarantors are also included in this registration
statement as additional registrants.

         
The Registrants hereby amend this Registration Statement on such
date or dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until
the Registrants shall file a further amendment which
specifically states that this Registration Statement shall
thereafter become effective in accordance with Section 8(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933 or until the Registration Statement
shall become effective on such date as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, acting pursuant to said Section 8(a), may
determine.

prospectus. The names of any underwriters and the specific terms of
a plan of distribution will be stated in the prospectus supplement.
The selling unitholders, certain of whom are affiliates of Summit
Midstream Partners, LP, are deemed to be "underwriters" within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Securities Act, and, as a result, will be deemed to be making a
primary offering of securities on our behalf. We will not receive
any of the proceeds from any sale of our Units by the selling
unitholders.

        Our
common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
under the symbol "SMLP."

        
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk.
Limited partnerships are inherently different from corporations.
You should review carefully the risk factors identified in the
documents incorporated by reference herein for a discussion of
important risks you should consider before you make an investment
in our securities.

        
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state
securities commission has approved or disapproved these securities
or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

    

The date
of this prospectus

should not rely on it.

        
You should not assume that the information contained in this

should not assume that the information contained in the documents

  ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS

        This
prospectus is part of a registration statement that we have filed
with the SEC using a "shelf" registration process. Under this shelf
registration process, we may over time, in one or more offerings,
offer and sell any combination of the securities described in this
prospectus, and the selling unitholders may, over time, in one or
more offerings, offer and sell Units.

        This
prospectus provides you with a general description of Summit
Midstream Partners, LP and the securities that are registered
hereunder. Each time we sell any securities offered by this
prospectus, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will
contain specific information about the terms of that offering and
the securities being offered. Because the selling unitholders are
deemed to be "underwriters" under the Securities Act, each time the
selling unitholders sell any Units offered by this prospectus, the
applicable selling unitholder is required to provide you with this
prospectus and any related prospectus supplement containing
specific information about such selling unitholder and the terms of
the Units, to the extent not described in this prospectus, being
offered in the manner required by the Securities Act. Any
prospectus supplement may also add to, update or change information
contained in this prospectus. To the extent information in this
prospectus is inconsistent with the information contained in a
prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the
prospectus supplement.

        Additional
information, including our financial statements and the notes
thereto, is incorporated in this prospectus by reference to our
reports filed with the SEC. Before you invest in our securities,
you should carefully read this prospectus, including the
information provided under the heading "Risk Factors," any
prospectus supplement, the information incorporated by reference in
this prospectus and any prospectus supplement (including the
documents described under the heading "Where You Can Find More
Information" in both this prospectus and any prospectus
supplement), and any additional information you may need to make
your investment decision.

certain of our gathering agreements in the event of a bankruptcy of
one or more of our customers;


•

our
ability to acquire any assets owned by third parties, which is

the risks and uncertainties that could affect us. In addition, in
light of these risks and uncertainties, the matters referred to in

continental United States. We provide natural gas gathering,
treating and processing services as well as crude oil and produced
water gathering services pursuant to primarily long-term and
fee-based agreements with our customers. Our results are driven
primarily by the volumes of natural gas that we gather, treat,
compress and process as well as by the volumes of crude oil and
produced water that we gather. We currently operate in five
unconventional resource basins:

the
Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in
northern West Virginia and the Utica and Point Pleasant shale
formations in southeastern Ohio;

  RISK FACTORS

        Limited
partner interests are inherently different from capital stock of a
corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are
subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation
engaged in similar businesses. We urge you to carefully consider
the risk factors included in our most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, each as
amended and updated from time to time, which are incorporated by
reference into this prospectus and the applicable prospectus
supplement, together with all of the other information included in
this prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement and the
documents we incorporate by reference, in evaluating an investment
in our securities. If any of the risks discussed in the foregoing
documents were to materialize, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely
affected and you could lose all or part of your investment. Please
also read "Forward-Looking Statements."

Table of Contents 

  
  USE OF PROCEEDS

        The
actual application of proceeds to us from the sale of any
particular offering of securities using this prospectus will be
determined at the time of the offering and will be described in the
applicable prospectus supplement relating to such offering. The
precise amount and timing of the application of these proceeds will
depend upon, among other factors, our funding requirements and the
availability and cost of other funds. We will not receive any of
the proceeds from any sale of Units by the selling
unitholders.

Table of Contents 

  
  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES

        The
following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges
for the periods indicated on a consolidated historical basis. For
purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges,
"earnings" are defined as income or loss before income taxes and
adjustments for income or loss from equity method investees plus
fixed charges and distributions from equity method investees less
capitalized interest. "Fixed charges" consist of interest expensed
and capitalized, amortization of deferred loan costs and an
estimate of interest within rent expense.

December 31, 2015 included $248.9 million of goodwill
impairments.

$31.5 million of earnings for the year ended December 31,
2014. Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31,
2014 included a goodwill impairment of
$54.2 million.

  DESCRIPTION OF OUR COMMON UNITS

 The
Units

        The
common units represent limited partner interests in us. The holders
of common units are entitled to participate in partnership
distributions and are entitled to exercise the rights and
privileges available to limited partners under our partnership
agreement. For a description of the relative rights and preferences
of holders of common units to partnership distributions, please
read this section and "Provisions of Our Partnership Agreement
Relating to Cash Distributions." For a description of the rights
and privileges of limited partners under our partnership agreement,
including voting rights, please read "The Partnership
Agreement."

        Our
outstanding common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol
"SMLP," and any additional common units we issue will also be
listed on the NYSE. As of November 4, 2016 there were
72,088,168 common units outstanding. On November 4, 2016 the
last reported sales price of our common units on the NYSE was
$21.95 per common unit. 

 Transfer
Agent and Registrar

        Duties.
    American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company ("AST") serves as the transfer
agent, cash distribution paying agent and registrar for the common
units. We will pay all fees charged by the transfer agent for
transfers of common units except the following that must be paid by
unitholders:

•

surety
bond premiums to replace lost or stolen certificates, taxes and
other governmental charges in connection therewith;


•

special
charges for services requested by a common unitholder; and


•

other
similar fees or charges.

        There
will be no charge to unitholders for disbursements of our cash
distributions. We will indemnify AST, its agents and each of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers and employees against
all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or
omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any
liability due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of
the indemnified person or entity.

        Resignation
or Removal.     The
transfer agent may resign, by notice to us, or be removed by us.
The resignation or removal of the transfer agent will become
effective upon our appointment of a successor transfer agent, cash
distribution paying agent and registrar and its acceptance of the
appointment. If no successor has been appointed and has accepted
the appointment within 30 days after notice of the resignation
or removal, our general partner may act as the transfer agent and
registrar until a successor is appointed.

 Transfer
of Common Units

        By
transfer of common units in accordance with our partnership
agreement, each transferee of common units shall be admitted as a
limited partner with respect to the common units transferred when
such transfer and admission are reflected in our books and records.
Each transferee:

•

automatically
agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of, and is deemed to
have executed, our partnership agreement;


•

represents
and warrants that the transferee has the right, power, authority
and capacity to enter into our partnership agreement; and


•

gives the
consents, waivers and approvals contained in our partnership
agreement.

5

 

  

Table of Contents

        Our
general partner will cause any transfers to be recorded on our
books and records no less frequently than quarterly.

        We
may, at our discretion, treat the nominee holder of a common unit
as the absolute owner. In that case, the beneficial holder's rights
are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder
as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the
nominee holder.

        Common
units are securities and any transfers are subject to the laws
governing the transfer of securities.

        Until
a common unit has been transferred on our books, we and the
transfer agent may treat the record holder of the unit as the
absolute owner for all purposes, except as otherwise required by
law or stock exchange regulations.

  DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND
GUARANTEES

        The
following description, together with the additional information we
include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes certain
general terms and provisions of the debt securities that we may
offer under this prospectus. When we offer to sell a particular
series of debt securities, we will describe the specific terms of
the series in a supplement to this prospectus. We will also
indicate in the supplement to what extent the general terms and
provisions described in this prospectus apply to a particular
series of debt securities.

        As

to Summit Midstream Holdings, LLC and not to any of its
subsidiaries, (ii) the term "Finance Corp." refers to Summit
Midstream Finance Corp., (iii) the term "Parent" refers to
Summit Midstream Partners, LP and not to any of its
subsidiaries, and (iv) the terms "we," "our," "us" or

stated or the context otherwise requires.

        We
may issue debt securities either separately, or together with, or
upon the conversion or exercise of or in exchange for, other
securities described in this prospectus. Debt securities may be our
senior, senior subordinated or subordinated obligations and, unless
otherwise specified in a supplement to this prospectus, the debt
securities will be our direct, unsecured obligations and may be
issued in one or more series.

        The
debt securities and any guarantees will be issued under an
indenture, dated July 15, 2014, by and between the Issuers and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. We have summarized
select portions of the indenture below. The summary is not
complete. The indenture has been incorporated by reference into
this registration statement, and you should read the indenture for
provisions that may be important to you. In the summary below, we
have included references to the section numbers of the indenture so
that you can easily locate these provisions. Capitalized terms used
in the summary and not defined herein have the meanings specified
in the indenture.

 General

        The
terms of each series of debt securities and guarantees will be
established by or pursuant to a resolution of the board of
directors of our general partner and set forth or determined in the
manner provided in a resolution of the board of directors of our
general partner, in an officer's certificate or by a supplemental
indenture. (Section 2.2) The particular terms of each series
of debt securities and guarantees will be described in a prospectus
supplement relating to such series (including any pricing
supplement or term sheet).

        We
can issue an unlimited amount of debt securities under the
indenture that may be in one or more series with the same or
various maturities, at par, at a premium, or at a discount.
(Section 2.1) We will set forth in a prospectus supplement
(including any pricing supplement or term sheet) relating to any
series of debt securities being offered, the aggregate principal
amount and the following terms of the debt securities, if
applicable:

•

the title
and ranking of the debt securities (including the terms of any
subordination provisions);


•

        We
may issue debt securities that provide for an amount less than
their stated principal amount to be due and payable upon
declaration of acceleration of their maturity pursuant to the terms
of the indenture. We will provide you with information on the
federal income tax considerations and other special considerations
applicable to any of these debt securities in the applicable
prospectus supplement.

        If
we denominate the purchase price of any of the debt securities in a
foreign currency or currencies or a foreign currency unit or units,

of debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currencies
or a foreign currency unit or units, we will provide you with

prospectus supplement.

 Transfer
and Exchange

        Each
debt security will be represented by either one or more global
securities registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company
(the "Depositary"), or a nominee of the Depositary (we will refer
to any debt security represented by a global debt security as a
"book-entry debt security"), or a certificate issued in definitive
registered form (we will refer to any debt security represented by
a certificated security as a "certificated debt security") as set
forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Except as set forth
under the heading "Global Debt Securities and Book-Entry System"
below, book-entry debt securities will not be issuable in
certificated form.

        Certificated
Debt Securities.     You
may transfer or exchange certificated debt securities at any office
we maintain in accordance with the terms of the indenture.
(Section 2.4) No service charge will be made for any transfer
or exchange of certificated debt securities, but we may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange.
(Section 2.7)

        You
may effect the transfer of certificated debt securities and the
right to receive the principal of, premium and interest on
certificated debt securities only by surrendering the certificate
representing those certificated debt securities and either
reissuance by us or the trustee of the certificate to the new
holder or the issuance by us or the trustee of a new certificate to
the new holder.

        Global
Debt Securities and Book-Entry System.     Each
global debt security representing book-entry debt securities will
be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Depositary, and registered
in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of the
Depositary.

 Covenants

        We
will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement any
restrictive covenants applicable to any issue of debt securities.
(Article IV)

Table of Contents

 No
Protection in the Event of a Change of Control

        Unless
we state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the
debt securities will not contain any provisions which may afford
holders of the debt securities protection in the event we have a
change in control or in the event of a highly leveraged transaction
(whether or not such transaction results in a change in control)
which could adversely affect holders of debt securities.

 Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets

        The
Company may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey,
transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and
assets to any person (a "successor person") unless:

•

we are the
surviving entity or the successor person (if other than the
Company) is an entity organized and validly existing under the laws
of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and expressly assumes our
obligations on the debt securities and under the indenture; and


•

immediately
after giving effect to the transaction, no Default (as defined in
the indenture) or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be
continuing.

        Notwithstanding
the above, any of our subsidiaries may consolidate with, merge into
or transfer all or part of its properties to us or our Parent, and
we may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of our
properties to our Parent. (Section 5.1)

 Events
of Default

        "Event
of Default" means with respect to any series of debt securities,
any of the following:

•

default in
the payment of any interest upon any debt security of that series
when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default
for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the
payment is deposited by us with the trustee or with a paying agent
prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);


•

default in
the payment of principal of any debt security of that series at its
maturity;


•

default in
the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by us
in the indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been
included in the indenture solely for the benefit of a series of
debt securities other than that series), which default continues
uncured for a period of 60 days after (i) we receive
written notice from the trustee or (ii) the Issuers and the
trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than
25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that
series as provided in the indenture;


•

certain
voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Issuers; and


•

any other
Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that
series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
(Section 6.1).

        No
Event of Default with respect to a particular series of debt
securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency
or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with
respect to any other series of debt securities. (Section 6.1)
The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration
under the indenture may constitute an event of default under
certain indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries outstanding from
time to time.

        We
will provide the trustee written notice of any Default or Event of
Default within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence of
such Default or Event of Default, which notice will describe in
reasonable detail the status of such Default or Event of Default
and what action we are taking or propose to take in respect
thereof. (Section 6.1)

10

 

  

Table of Contents

        If
an Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series
at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the trustee
or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of that series may, by a notice in
writing to us (and to the trustee if given by the holders), declare
to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the debt
securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of
the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that
series) and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all debt
securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default
resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all outstanding debt
securities will become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any
holder of outstanding debt securities. At any time after a
declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any
series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment
of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of
that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of
Default, other than the non-payment of accelerated principal and
interest, if any, with respect to debt securities of that series,
have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture.
(Section 6.2) We refer you to the prospectus supplement
relating to any series of debt securities that are discount
securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration
of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.

        The
indenture provides that the trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture unless the
trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost,
liability or expense which might be incurred by it in exercising
such right or power. (Section 7.1(e)) Subject to certain
rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the
debt securities of that series. (Section 6.12)

        No
holder of any debt security of any series will have any right to
institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to
the indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or
for any remedy under the indenture, unless:

•

that
holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to debt securities of that
series; and


•

the
holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding
debt securities of that series have made written request, and
offered reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to
institute the proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has not
received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series a
direction inconsistent with that request and has failed to
institute the proceeding within 60 days.
(Section 6.7)

        Notwithstanding
any other provision in the indenture, the holder of any debt
security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive
payment of the principal of, premium and any interest on that debt
security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security
and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.
(Section 6.8)

        The
indenture requires us, within 120 days after the end of our
fiscal year, to furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance
with the indenture. (Section 4.3) If a Default or Event of
Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of
any series and if it is known to a responsible officer of the
trustee, the trustee shall mail to each securityholder of the debt
securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default
within 90 days after it occurs. The indenture provides that
the trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities
of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment
on any debt securities of that series) with respect to debt
securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith
that withholding notice is in the interest of the holders of those
debt securities. (Section 7.5)

with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the
qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of
1939. (Section 9.1)

        We
may also modify and amend the indenture with the consent of the
holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the
modifications or amendments. We may not make any modification or

security then outstanding if that amendment will:

•

reduce the
amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;


•

reduce the
rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including
default interest) on any debt security;

of that series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration);


•

principal of or premium or interest on any debt security payable in
currency other than that stated in the debt security;

securities and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment and to waivers or amendments; or


•

waive a
redemption payment with respect to any debt security.
(Section 9.3)

        Except
for certain specified provisions, the holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of
any series may on behalf of the holders of all debt securities of
that series waive our compliance with provisions of the indenture.
(Section 9.2) The holders of a majority in principal amount of
the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the
holders of all the debt securities of such series waive any past
default under the indenture with respect to that series and its
consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of,
premium or any interest on any debt security of that series;
provided, however, that the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may rescind
an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment
default that resulted from the acceleration.
(Section 6.13)

 Defeasance
of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain
Circumstances

        Legal
Defeasance.     The
indenture provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of
the applicable series of debt securities, we may be discharged from
any and all obligations in respect of the debt securities of any
series (subject to certain exceptions). We will be so discharged
upon the deposit with the trustee, in trust, of money and/or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of debt securities
denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars,
government obligations of the government that issued or caused to
be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and
principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money or
U.S. government obligations in an amount sufficient in the opinion
of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of
principal, premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund
payments in respect of the debt securities of that series on the
stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of
the indenture and those debt securities.

        This
discharge may occur only if, among other things, we have delivered
to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that we have received
from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the
indenture, there has been a change in the applicable United States
federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the holders of the
debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or
loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of
the deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United
States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the
deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred.
(Section 8.3)

        Defeasance
of Certain Covenants.     The
indenture provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of
the applicable series of debt securities, upon compliance with
certain conditions:

•

we may
omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading
"Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets" and certain other
covenants set forth in the indenture, as well as any additional
covenants which may be set forth in the applicable prospectus
supplement; and


•

any
omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a
Default or an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities
of that series ("covenant defeasance").

        The
conditions include:

•

depositing
with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or, in
the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other
than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of

13

 

  

Table of Contents

the
government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that,
through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with
their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each
installment of principal of, premium and interest on and any
mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities
of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in
accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt
securities; and

•

delivering
to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders
of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income,
gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a
result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be
subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if the deposit and related covenant defeasance had not
occurred. (Section 8.4)

        Covenant
Defeasance and Events of Default.     In
the event we exercise our option to effect covenant defeasance with
respect to any series of debt securities and the debt securities of
that series are declared due and payable because of the occurrence
of any Event of Default, the amount of money and/or U.S. government
obligations or foreign government obligations on deposit with the
trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt
securities of that series at the time of their stated maturity but
may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of
that series at the time of the acceleration resulting from the
Event of Default. However, we shall remain liable for those
payments. (Section 8.4)

 No
Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees or
Unitholders

        None
of our past, present or future directors, officers, employees or
unitholders, as such, will have any liability for any of our
obligations under the debt securities or the indenture or for any
claim based on, or in respect or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. By accepting a debt security, each holder waives
and releases all such liability. This waiver and release is part of
the consideration for the issue of the debt securities. However,
this waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities
under U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

 Governing
Law

        The
indenture and the debt securities, including any claim or
controversy arising out of or relating to the indenture or the debt
securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof other
than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).
(Section 10.10)

  PROVISIONS OF OUR PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT RELATING TO CASH
DISTRIBUTIONS

        Set
forth below is a summary of the significant provisions of our
partnership agreement that relate to cash distributions.

 Distributions
of Available Cash

        General.
    Our
partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the
end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash to
unitholders of record on the applicable record date.

        Definition
of Available Cash.     Available
cash generally means, for any quarter, all cash on hand at the end
of that quarter:

•

less
the amount
of cash reserves established by our general partner at the date of
determination of available cash for the quarter to:


•

provide
for the proper conduct of our business (including reserves for our
future capital expenditures and anticipated future debt service
requirements);


•

comply
with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other
agreements; or


•

provide
funds for distributions to our unitholders and to our general
partner for any one or more of the next four quarters (provided
that our general partner may not establish cash reserves for
distributions unless it determines that the establishment of
reserves will not prevent us from distributing the minimum
quarterly distribution on all common units and any cumulative
arrearages on such common units for the current quarter);


•

plus
, if our
general partner so determines, all or any portion of the cash on
hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter
resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the
end of such quarter.

        The
purpose and effect of the last bullet point above is to allow our
general partner, if it so decides, to use cash from working capital
borrowings made after the end of the quarter but on or before the
date of determination of available cash for that quarter to pay
distributions to unitholders. Under our partnership agreement,
working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made
under a credit facility, commercial paper facility or similar
financing arrangement, and in all cases are used solely for working
capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners, and with the
intent of the borrower to repay such borrowings within
12 months with funds other than from additional working
capital borrowings. The proceeds of working capital borrowings
increase operating surplus and repayments of working capital
borrowings are generally operating expenditures (as described
below) and thus reduce operating surplus when repayments are made.
However, if working capital borrowings, which increase operating
surplus, are not repaid during the 12-month period following the
borrowing, they will be deemed repaid at the end of such period,
thus decreasing operating surplus at such time. When such working
capital borrowings are in fact repaid, they will not be treated as
a further reduction in operating surplus because operating surplus
will have been previously reduced by the deemed
repayment.

        Intent
to Distribute the Minimum Quarterly Distribution.
    We
intend to make a minimum quarterly distribution to the holders of
our common units of $0.40 per unit, or $1.60 on an annualized
basis, to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations
after the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and
expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to our general
partner. Our most recent quarterly distribution was $0.575 per
unit, or $2.30 annualized. However, there is no guarantee that we
will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our units in any
quarter. Even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or
revoked, the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the
decision to make any distribution is determined by our general
partner, taking into consideration the terms of our partnership
agreement.

Table of Contents

        General
Partner Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights.
    Our
general partner is entitled to 2.0% of all distributions that we
make prior to our liquidation. Our general partner has the right,
but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of
capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest. Our
general partner's 2.0% interest in our distributions will be
reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general
partner does not contribute a proportionate amount of capital to us
to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest.

        Our
general partner also currently holds incentive distribution rights
that entitle it to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum
of 50.0%, of the cash we distribute from operating surplus (as
defined below) in excess of $0.46 per unit per quarter. The maximum
distribution of 50.0% includes distributions paid to our general
partner on its 2.0% general partner interest and assumes that our
general partner maintains its general partner interest at 2.0%. The
maximum distribution of 50.0% does not include any distributions
that our general partner may receive on any common units that it
owns.

 Operating
Surplus and Capital Surplus

        General.
    All
cash distributed to unitholders will be characterized as either
being paid from "operating surplus" or "capital surplus." We treat
distributions of available cash from operating surplus differently
than distributions of available cash from capital
surplus.

        Operating
Surplus.     We
define operating surplus as:

•

Table of Contents

        As
described above, operating surplus does not reflect actual cash on
hand that is available for distribution to our unitholders and is
not limited to cash generated by operations. For example, it
includes a provision that will enable us, if we choose, to
distribute as operating surplus up to $50.0 million of cash we
receive in the future from non-operating sources such as asset
sales, issuances of securities and long-term borrowings that would
otherwise be distributed as capital surplus. In addition, the
effect of including, as described above, certain cash distributions
on equity interests in operating surplus is to increase operating
surplus by the amount of any such cash distributions. As a result,
we may also distribute as operating surplus up to the amount of any
such cash that we receive from non-operating sources.

        We
define interim capital transactions as (i) borrowings,
refinancings or refundings of indebtedness (other than working
capital borrowings and items purchased on open account in the
ordinary course of business) and sales of debt securities,
(ii) sales of equity securities, (iii) sales or other
dispositions of assets, other than sales or other dispositions of
inventory, accounts receivable and other assets in the ordinary
course of business and sales or other dispositions of assets as
part of ordinary course asset retirements or replacements and
(iv) capital contributions received.

        We
define operating expenditures as all of our cash expenditures,
including, but not limited to, taxes, compensation of employees,
officers and directors of our general partner, reimbursements of
expenses to our general partner and its affiliates, interest
payments, payments made in the ordinary course of business under
interest rate hedge contracts and commodity hedge contracts
(provided that (i) with respect to amounts paid in connection
with the initial purchase of an interest rate hedge contract or a
commodity hedge contract, such amounts will be amortized over the
life of the applicable interest rate hedge contract or commodity
hedge contract and (ii) payments made in connection with the
termination of any interest rate hedge contract or commodity hedge
contract prior to the expiration of its stipulated settlement or
termination date will be included in operating expenditures in
equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of
such interest rate hedge contract or commodity hedge contract), and
repayment of working capital borrowings; provided, however, that
operating expenditures do not include:

•

repayment
of working capital borrowings where such borrowings have previously
been deemed to have been repaid (as described above);


•

payments
(including prepayments and prepayment penalties) of principal of
and premium on indebtedness other than working capital
borrowings;


•

expansion
capital expenditures;


•

payment of
transaction expenses (including, but not limited to, taxes)
relating to interim capital transactions;


•

distributions
to our partners; or


•

repurchases
of our units, other than repurchases to satisfy obligations under
employee benefit plans or reimbursement of expenses of our general
partner for purchases of units to satisfy obligations under
employee benefit plans.

        Capital
Surplus.     Capital
surplus is defined in our partnership agreement as any distribution
of available cash in excess of our cumulative operating surplus.
Accordingly, except as described above, capital surplus would
generally be generated by:

•

borrowings
other than working capital borrowings;


•

sales of
our equity and debt securities; and

17

 

  

Table of Contents

•

sales or
other dispositions of assets, other than inventory, accounts
receivable and other assets sold in the ordinary course of business
or as part of ordinary course retirement or replacement of
assets.

        Characterization
of Cash Distributions.     Our
partnership agreement requires that we treat all available cash
distributed as coming from operating surplus until the sum of all
available cash distributed since the closing of our initial public
offering equals the operating surplus from the closing of our
initial public offering through the end of the quarter immediately
preceding that distribution. Our partnership agreement requires
that we treat any amount distributed in excess of operating
surplus, regardless of its source, as capital surplus. We do not
anticipate that we will make any distributions from capital
surplus.

 Capital
Expenditures

        Maintenance
capital expenditures are cash expenditures (including expenditures
for the addition or improvement to, or the replacement of, our
capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the
construction or development of new, capital assets) made to
maintain our operating income or operating capacity over the long
term. We expect that a primary component of maintenance capital
expenditures will include expenditures to connect additional wells
to our gathering systems to offset natural declines in production
over time and for routine equipment and pipeline maintenance or
replacement due to age or obsolescence.

        Expansion
capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred for
acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase
our operating income or operating capacity over the long term.
Expansion capital expenditures include interest payments (and
related fees) on debt incurred and issued to finance the
construction of such capital improvement and paid in respect of the
period beginning on the date that we enter into a binding
obligation to commence construction of the capital improvement and
ending on the earlier to occur of the date that such capital
improvement commences commercial service and the date that such
capital improvement is abandoned or disposed of. Examples of
expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of
equipment, or the construction, development or acquisition of
additional pipeline or treating capacity or new compression
capacity, to the extent such capital expenditures are expected to
expand our long-term operating capacity or operating
income.

        Capital
expenditures that are made in part for maintenance capital purposes
and in part for expansion capital purposes will be allocated
between maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital
expenditures by our general partner.

 Distributions
of Available Cash from Operating Surplus

        We
will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus
for each quarter in the following manner:

•

first,
98.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner, until
we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the
minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter; and


•

thereafter,
in the
manner described in "—General Partner Interest and Incentive
Distribution Rights" below.

        The
preceding discussion is based on the assumptions that our general
partner maintains its 2.0% general partner interest and that we do
not issue additional classes of equity securities.

 Table of Contents

 General
Partner Interest and Incentive Distribution Rights

        Our
general partner is currently entitled to 2.0% of all distributions
that we make prior to our liquidation. Our general partner has the
right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount
of capital to us in order to maintain its 2.0% general partner
interest if we issue additional units. Our general partner's 2.0%
interest, and the percentage of our cash distributions to which it
is entitled from such 2.0% interest, will be proportionately
reduced if we issue additional units in the future (other than the
issuance of common units upon a reset of the incentive distribution
rights) and our general partner does not contribute a proportionate
amount of capital to us in order to maintain its 2.0% general
partner interest. Our partnership agreement does not require that
our general partner fund its capital contribution with cash. It may
instead fund its capital contribution by the contribution to us of
common units or other property.

        Incentive
distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing
percentage (13.0%, 23.0% and 48.0%) of quarterly distributions of
available cash from operating surplus after the minimum quarterly
distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved.
Our general partner currently holds the incentive distribution
rights, but may transfer these rights separately from its general
partner interest at any time without the approval of any
person.

        The
following discussion assumes that our general partner maintains its
2.0% general partner interest and that our general partner
continues to own the incentive distribution rights.

        If
for any quarter we have distributed available cash from operating
surplus to the common unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum
quarterly distribution, then, we will distribute any additional
available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the
unitholders and the general partner in the following
manner:

•

first,
98.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner, until
each unitholder receives a total of $0.46 per unit for that quarter
(the "first target distribution");


•

second,
85.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 15.0% to our general partner, until
each unitholder receives a total of $0.50 per unit for that quarter
(the "second target distribution");


•

third,
75.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 25.0% to our general partner, until
each unitholder receives a total of $0.60 per unit for that quarter
(the "third target distribution"); and


•

thereafter,
50.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 50.0% to our general
partner.

 Percentage
Allocations of Available Cash from Operating Surplus

        The
following table illustrates the percentage allocations of available
cash from operating surplus between the unitholders and our general
partner based on the specified target distribution levels. The
amounts set forth under "Marginal Percentage Interest in
Distributions" are the percentage interests of our general partner
and the unitholders in any available cash from operating surplus we
distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the
column "Total Quarterly Distribution Per Unit Target Amount." The
percentage interests shown for our unitholders and our general
partner for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable
to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum
quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth below
for our general partner include its 2.0% general partner interest
and assume that our general partner has contributed any

 General
Partner's Right to Reset Incentive Distribution
Levels

        Our
general partner, as the initial holder of our incentive
distribution rights, has the right under our partnership agreement
to elect to relinquish the right to receive incentive distribution
payments based on the initial target distribution levels and to
reset, at higher levels, the minimum quarterly distribution amount
and target distribution levels upon which the incentive
distribution payments to our general partner would be set. If our
general partner transfers all or a portion of our incentive
distribution rights in the future, then the holder or holders of a
majority of our incentive distribution rights will be entitled to
exercise this right. The following discussion assumes that our
general partner holds all of the incentive distribution rights at
the time that a reset election is made. Our general partner's right
to reset the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target
distribution levels upon which the incentive distributions payable
to our general partner are based may be exercised, without approval
of our unitholders or the conflicts committee of our general
partner, at any time when we have made cash distributions to the
holders of the incentive distribution rights at the highest level
of incentive distribution for each of the four consecutive fiscal
quarters immediately preceding such time and the amount of each
such distribution did not exceed adjusted operating surplus for
such quarter, respectively. If our general partner and its
affiliates are not the holders of a majority of the incentive
distribution rights at the time an election is made to reset the
minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution
levels, then the proposed reset will be subject to the prior
written concurrence of the general partner that the conditions
described above have been satisfied. The reset minimum quarterly
distribution amount and target distribution levels will be higher
than the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target
distribution levels prior to the reset such that our general
partner will not receive any incentive distributions under the
reset target distribution levels until cash distributions per unit
following this event increase as described below. We anticipate
that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order
to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would
otherwise not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per
common unit, taking into account the existing levels of incentive
distribution payments being made to our general partner.

        In
connection with the resetting of the minimum quarterly distribution
amount and the target distribution levels and the corresponding
relinquishment by our general partner of incentive distribution
payments based on the target distributions prior to the reset, our
general partner will be entitled to receive a number of newly
issued common units and general partner units based on a
predetermined formula described below that takes into account the
"cash parity" value of the average cash distributions related to
the incentive distribution rights received by our general partner
for the two quarters immediately preceding the reset event as
compared to the average cash distributions per common unit during
that two-quarter period. Our general partner will be issued the
number of general partner units necessary to maintain our general
partner's interest in us immediately prior to the reset
election.

        The
number of common units that our general partner would be entitled
to receive from us in connection with a resetting of the minimum
quarterly distribution amount and the target
distribution

Table of Contents

levels
then in effect would be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (x) the average aggregate amount of cash
distributions received by our general partner in respect of its
incentive distribution rights during the two consecutive fiscal
quarters ended immediately prior to the date of such reset election
by (y) the average of the aggregate amount of cash distributed
per common unit during each of these two quarters.

        Following
a reset election, the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be
reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount
per unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the
reset election (which amount we refer to as the "reset minimum
quarterly distribution") and the target distribution levels will be
reset to be correspondingly higher such that we would distribute
all of our available cash from operating surplus for each quarter
thereafter as follows:

•

first,
98.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner, until
each unitholder receives an amount per unit equal to 115.0% of the
reset minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter;


•

second,
85.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 15.0% to our general partner, until
each unitholder receives an amount per unit equal to 125.0% of the
reset minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter;


•

third,
75.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 25.0% to our general partner, until
each unitholder receives an amount per unit equal to 150.0% of the
reset minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter; and


•

thereafter,
50.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 50.0% to our general
partner.

 Distributions
From Capital Surplus

        How
Distributions from Capital Surplus Will Be Made.
    We
will make distributions of available cash from capital surplus, if
any, in the following manner:

•

first,
98.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner, until
we distribute for each common unit that was issued in our initial
public offering, an amount of available cash from capital surplus
equal to the initial public offering price of our initial public
offering; and


•

thereafter,
as if they
were distributions from operating surplus.

        The
preceding discussion is based on the assumption that our general
partner maintains its 2.0% general partner interest and that we do
not issue additional classes of equity securities.

        Effect
of a Distribution from Capital Surplus.     Our
partnership agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as
the repayment of the initial unit price from our initial public
offering, which is a return of capital. The initial public offering
price less any distributions of capital surplus per unit is
referred to as the "unrecovered initial unit price." Each time a
distribution of capital surplus is made, the minimum quarterly
distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in
the same proportion as the corresponding reduction in the
unrecovered initial unit price. Because distributions of capital
surplus will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and target
distribution levels after any of these distributions are made, it
may be easier for our general partner to receive incentive
distributions. However, any distribution of capital surplus before
the unrecovered initial unit price is reduced to zero cannot be
applied to the payment of the minimum quarterly
distribution.

        Once
we distribute capital surplus on a unit issued in our initial
public offering in an amount equal to the initial unit price, we
will reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and the target
distribution levels to zero. We will then make all future
distributions from operating surplus, with 50.0% being paid to the
unitholders, pro rata, and 50.0% to our general partner. The
percentage interests shown for our general partner include its 2.0%
general partner interest and assume that our general partner has
not transferred the incentive distribution rights.

Table of Contents

 Adjustment
to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution
Levels

        In
addition to adjusting the minimum quarterly distribution and target
distribution levels to reflect a distribution of capital surplus,
if we combine our units into fewer units or subdivide our units
into a greater number of units, we will proportionately
adjust:

•

the
minimum quarterly distribution;


•

the target
distribution levels;


•

the
unrecovered initial unit price;


•

the number
of general partner units comprising the general partner interest;
and


•

the per
unit arrearage in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on
the common units.

        For
example, if a two-for-one split of the common units should occur,
the minimum quarterly distribution, the target distribution levels
and the unrecovered initial unit price would each be reduced to 50%
of its initial level. We will not make any adjustment by reason of
the issuance of additional units for cash or property.

        In
addition, if legislation is enacted or if existing law is modified
or interpreted by a governmental authority, so that we become
taxable as a corporation or otherwise subject to taxation as an
entity for federal, state or local income tax purposes, our
partnership agreement specifies that the minimum quarterly
distribution and the target distribution levels for each quarter
may be reduced by multiplying each distribution level by a
fraction, the numerator of which is available cash for that quarter
(reduced by the amount of the estimated tax liability for such
quarter payable by reason of such legislation or interpretation)
and the denominator of which is the sum of available cash for that
quarter (reduced by the amount of the estimated tax liability for
such quarter payable by reason of such legislation or
interpretation) plus our general partner's estimate of our
aggregate liability for the quarter for such income taxes payable
by reason of such legislation or interpretation. To the extent that
the actual tax liability differs from the estimated tax liability
for any quarter, the difference will be accounted for in subsequent
quarters.

 Distributions
of Cash Upon Liquidation

        General.
    If
we dissolve in accordance with our partnership agreement, we will
sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process called
liquidation. We will first apply the proceeds of liquidation to the
payment of our creditors. We will distribute any remaining proceeds
to the unitholders and our general partner, in accordance with
their capital account balances, as adjusted to reflect any gain or
loss upon the sale or other disposition of our assets in
liquidation.

        Manner
of Adjustments for Gain.     The
manner of the adjustment for gain is set forth in our partnership
agreement. We will allocate any gain to our partners in the
following manner:

•

first,
to our
general partner and the holders of units who have negative balances
in their capital accounts to the extent of and in proportion to
those negative balances;


•

second
, 98.0% to
the common unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner,
until the capital account for each common unit is equal to the sum
of: (1) the unrecovered initial unit price; and (2) the
amount of the minimum quarterly distribution for the quarter during
which our liquidation occurs;


•

third
, 98.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to our general partner, until
we allocate under this paragraph an amount per unit equal to:
(1) the sum of the excess of the first target distribution per
unit over the minimum quarterly distribution per unit for each
quarter of our existence; less (2) the cumulative amount per
unit of any distributions of available cash from

22

 

  

Table of Contents

operating
surplus in excess of the minimum quarterly distribution per unit
that we distributed 98.0% to the unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to
our general partner, for each quarter of our existence;

•

fourth,
85.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 15.0% to our general partner, until
we allocate under this paragraph an amount per unit equal to:
(1) the sum of the excess of the second target distribution
per unit over the first target distribution per unit for each
quarter of our existence; less (2) the cumulative amount per
unit of any distributions of available cash from operating surplus
in excess of the first target distribution per unit that we
distributed 85.0% to the unitholders, pro rata, and 15.0% to our
general partner for each quarter of our existence;


•

fifth,
75.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 25.0% to our general partner, until
we allocate under this paragraph an amount per unit equal to:
(1) the sum of the excess of the third target distribution per
unit over the second target distribution per unit for each quarter
of our existence; less (2) the cumulative amount per unit of
any distributions of available cash from operating surplus in
excess of the second target distribution per unit that we
distributed 75.0% to the unitholders, pro rata, and 25.0% to our
general partner for each quarter of our existence; and


•

thereafter
, 50.0% to
all unitholders, pro rata, and 50.0% to our general
partner.

        The
percentages set forth above are based on the assumption that our
general partner has not transferred its incentive distribution
rights and that we do not issue additional classes of equity
securities.

        Manner
of Adjustments for Losses.     After
making allocations of loss to the general partner and the
unitholders in a manner intended to offset in reverse order the
allocations of gains that have previously been allocated, we will
generally allocate any loss to our general partner and the
unitholders in the following manner:

•

first,
98.0% to
the holders of common units in proportion to the positive balances
in their capital accounts and 2.0% to our general partner, until
the capital accounts of the common unitholders have been reduced to
zero; and


•

thereafter
, 100.0%
to our general partner.

        Adjustments
to Capital Accounts.     Our
partnership agreement requires that we make adjustments to capital
accounts upon the issuance of additional units. In this regard, our
partnership agreement specifies that we allocate any unrealized
and, for tax purposes, unrecognized gain resulting from the
adjustments to the unitholders and the general partner in the same
manner as we allocate gain upon liquidation. In the event that we
make positive adjustments to the capital accounts upon the issuance
of additional units, our partnership agreement requires that we
generally allocate any later negative adjustments to the capital
accounts resulting from the issuance of additional units or upon
our liquidation in a manner which results, to the extent possible,
in the partners' capital account balances equaling the amount which
they would have been if no earlier positive adjustments to the
capital accounts had been made. In contrast to the allocations of
gain, and except as provided above, we generally will allocate any
unrealized and unrecognized loss resulting from the adjustments to
capital accounts upon the issuance of additional units to the
unitholders and our general partner based on their respective
percentage ownership of us. If we make negative adjustments to the
capital accounts as a result of such loss, future positive
adjustments resulting from the issuance of additional units will be
allocated in a manner designed to reverse the prior negative
adjustments, and special allocations will be made upon liquidation
in a manner that results, to the extent possible, in our
unitholders' capital account balances equaling the amounts they
would have been if no earlier adjustments for loss had been
made.

 Organization
and Duration

        We
were organized in Delaware in May 2012 and have a perpetual
existence.

 Purpose

        Our
purpose under our partnership agreement is limited to any business
activities that are approved by our general partner and in any
event that lawfully may be conducted by a limited partnership
organized under Delaware law; provided that our general partner may
not cause us to engage, directly or indirectly, in any business
activity that our general partner determines would be reasonably
likely to cause us to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise taxable as an entity for federal income
tax purposes.

        Although
our general partner has the power to cause us, our operating
company and its subsidiaries to engage in activities other than the
business of gathering, treating, processing and transporting
natural gas and providing crude oil and produced water gathering
services, our general partner has no current plans to do so and may
decline to do so free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to us or
our unitholders, other than the implied contractual covenant of
good faith and fair dealing. Our general partner is generally
authorized to perform all acts it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to carry out our purposes and to conduct our
business.

 Cash
Distributions

        Our
partnership agreement specifies the manner in which we will make
cash distributions to holders of our common units and other
partnership interests as well as to our general partner in respect
of its general partner interest and its incentive distribution
rights. For a description of these cash distribution provisions,
please read "Provisions of Our Partnership Agreement Relating to
Cash Distributions."

 Capital
Contributions

        Unitholders
are not obligated to make additional capital contributions, except

 Limited
Liability

        Assuming
that a limited partner does not participate in the control of our
business within the meaning of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited
Partnership Act (the "Delaware Act") and that it otherwise acts in
conformity with the provisions of our partnership agreement, its
liability under the Delaware Act will be limited, subject to
possible exceptions, to the amount of capital it is obligated to
contribute to us for its common units plus its share of any
undistributed profits and assets. If it were determined, however,
that the right of, or exercise of the right by, the limited
partners as a group:

•

to remove
or replace our general partner;


•

to approve
some amendments to our partnership agreement; or


•

to take
other action under our partnership agreement;

constituted
"participation in the control" of our business for the purposes of
the Delaware Act, then the limited partners could be held
personally liable for our obligations under the laws of Delaware,
to the same extent as our general partner. This liability would
extend to persons who transact business with us who reasonably
believe that a limited partner is a general partner. Neither our
partnership agreement nor the Delaware Act specifically provides
for legal recourse against our general partner if a limited partner
were to lose limited liability through any fault of our general
partner. While this does not mean that a limited partner could not
seek legal recourse, we know of no precedent for such a claim in
Delaware case law.

        Under
the Delaware Act, a limited partnership may not make a distribution
to a partner if, after the distribution, all liabilities of the
limited partnership, other than liabilities to partners on account
of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the
recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the
partnership, would exceed the fair value of the assets of the
limited partnership, except that the fair value of property that is
subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is
limited is included in the assets of the limited partnership only
to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that
liability. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the
assets of a limited partnership, the Delaware Act provides that the
fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of
creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited
partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property
exceeds the nonrecourse liability. The Delaware Act provides that a
limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time of
the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the
Delaware Act shall be liable to the limited partnership for the
amount of the distribution for three years. Under the Delaware Act,
a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable
for the obligations of its assignor to make contributions to the
partnership, except that such person is not obligated for
liabilities unknown to it at the time it became a limited partner
and that could not be ascertained from the partnership
agreement.

        Our
subsidiaries conduct business in nine states and we may have
subsidiaries that conduct business in other states in the future.
Maintenance of our limited liability as a member of our primary
operating subsidiary, Summit Holdings, which we refer to as our
"operating company," may require compliance with legal requirements
in the jurisdictions in which the operating company conducts
business, including qualifying our subsidiaries to do business
there.

        Limitations
on the liability of members or limited partners for the obligations
of a limited liability company or limited partnership have not been
clearly established in many jurisdictions. If, by virtue of our
ownership interest in our operating company or otherwise, it were
determined that we were conducting business in any state without
compliance with the applicable limited partnership or limited
liability company statute, or that the right or exercise of the
right by the limited partners as a group to remove or replace our
general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership
agreement, or to take other action under our partnership agreement
constituted "participation in the control" of our business for
purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction, then the
limited partners could be

26

 

  

Table of Contents

held
personally liable for our obligations under the law of that
jurisdiction to the same extent as our general partner under the
circumstances. We will operate in a manner that our general partner
considers reasonable and necessary or appropriate to preserve the
limited liability of the limited partners.

 Issuance
of Additional Partnership Interests

        Our
partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of
additional partnership interests for the consideration and on the
terms and conditions determined by our general partner without the
approval of our limited partners.

        It
is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the issuance of
additional common units or other partnership interests. Holders of
any additional common units we issue will be entitled to share
equally with the then-existing holders of common units in our
distributions of available cash. In addition, the issuance of
additional common units or other partnership interests may dilute
the value of the interests of the then-existing holders of common
units in our net assets.

        In
accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership
agreement, we may also issue additional partnership interests that,
as determined by our general partner, may have rights to
distributions or special voting rights to which the common units
are not entitled. In addition, our partnership agreement does not
prohibit our subsidiaries from issuing equity securities, which may
effectively rank senior to the common units.

        Upon
issuance of additional partnership interests (other than the
issuance of common units upon a reset of the incentive distribution
rights) our general partner will be entitled, but not required, to
make additional capital contributions to the extent necessary to
maintain its 2.0% general partner interest in us. Our general
partner's 2.0% interest in us will be reduced if we issue
additional units in the future (other than in those circumstances
described above) and our general partner does not contribute a
proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its 2.0% general
partner interest. Moreover, our general partner has the right,
which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of
its affiliates, to purchase common units or other partnership
interests whenever, and on the same terms that, we issue those
interests to persons other than our general partner and its
affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain the percentage
interest of the general partner and its affiliates, including such
interest represented by common units, that existed immediately
prior to each issuance. The holders of common units do not have
preemptive rights under our partnership agreement to acquire
additional common units or other partnership interests.

 Amendment
of Our Partnership Agreement

        General.
    Amendments
to our partnership agreement may be proposed only by our general
partner. However, our general partner has no duty or obligation to
propose any amendment and may decline to do so free of any duty or
obligation whatsoever to us or our unitholders, including any duty
to act in the best interests of our partnership or our unitholders,
other than the implied contractual covenants of good faith and fair
dealing. In order to adopt a proposed amendment, other than the
amendments discussed below, our general partner must seek written
approval of the holders of the number of units required to approve
the amendment or call a meeting of the limited partners to consider
and vote upon the proposed amendment. Except as described below, an
amendment must be approved by a unit majority.

        Prohibited
Amendments.     No
amendment may be made that would:

•

enlarge
the obligations of any limited partner without its consent, unless
approved by at least a majority of the type or class of limited
partner interests so affected; or

27

 

  

Table of Contents

•

enlarge
the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of,
or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or
otherwise payable by us to our general partner or any of its
affiliates without the consent of our general partner, which
consent may be given or withheld in its sole discretion.

        The
provision of our partnership agreement preventing the amendments
having the effects described in the clauses above can be amended
upon the approval of the holders of at least 90.0% of the
outstanding units, voting as a single class (including units owned
by our general partner and its affiliates). As of November 4,
2016, our general partner and its affiliates beneficially owned
approximately 49.6% of the outstanding common units.

        No
Unitholder Approval.     Our
general partner may generally make amendments to our partnership
agreement without the approval of any limited partner to
reflect:

•

a change
in our name, the location of our principal place of business, our
registered agent or our registered office;


•

the
admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of partners in
accordance with our partnership agreement;


•

a change
that our general partner determines to be necessary or appropriate
for us to qualify or to continue our qualification as a limited
partnership or a partnership in which the limited partners have
limited liability under the laws of any state or to ensure that
neither we, our operating company nor its subsidiaries will be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise
taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes;


•

a change
in our fiscal year or taxable year and related changes;


•

an
amendment that is necessary, in the opinion of our counsel, to
prevent us or our general partner or its directors, officers,
agents or trustees from in any manner being subjected to the
provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, whether
or not substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently
applied or proposed by the United States Department of Labor;


•

an
amendment that our general partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the authorization or issuance of
additional partnership interests or rights to acquire partnership
interests;


•

any
amendment expressly permitted in our partnership agreement to be
made by our general partner acting alone;


•

an
amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a merger
agreement that has been approved under the terms of our partnership
agreement;


•

any
amendment that our general partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate for the formation by us of, or our investment in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company
or other entity, as otherwise permitted by our partnership
agreement;


•

mergers
with, conveyances to or conversions into another limited liability
entity that is newly formed and has no assets, liabilities or
operations at the time of the merger, conveyance or conversion
other than those it receives by way of the merger, conveyance or
conversion; or


•

any other
amendments substantially similar to any of the matters described
above.

28

 

  

Table of Contents

        In
addition, our general partner may make amendments to our
partnership agreement, without the approval of any limited partner,
if our general partner determines that those amendments:

•

do not
adversely affect in any material respect the limited partners
considered as a whole or any particular class of partnership
interests as compared to other classes of partnership
interests;


•

are
necessary or appropriate to satisfy any requirements, conditions or
guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or
regulation of any federal or state agency or judicial authority or
contained in any federal or state statute;


•

are
necessary or appropriate to facilitate the trading of units or to
comply with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any
securities exchange on which the units are or will be listed for
trading;


•

are
necessary or appropriate for any action taken by our general
partner relating to splits or combinations of units under the
provisions of our partnership agreement; or


•

are
required to effect the intent expressed in this prospectus or the
intent of the provisions of our partnership agreement or are
otherwise contemplated by our partnership agreement.

        Opinion
of Counsel and Limited Partner Approval.

    Our general partner will not be required to
obtain an opinion of counsel that an amendment will not result in a
loss of limited liability to the limited partners or result in our
being treated as an entity for federal income tax purposes in
connection with any of the amendments described above under
"—No Unitholder Approval." No other amendments to our
partnership agreement will become effective without the approval of
holders of at least 90.0% of the outstanding units voting as a
single class unless we first obtain an opinion of counsel to the
effect that the amendment will not affect the limited liability
under applicable law of any of our limited partners.

        In
addition to the above restrictions, any amendment that would have a
material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any type or
class of outstanding units in relation to other classes of units
will require the approval of at least a majority of the type or
class of units so affected. Any amendment that reduces the voting
percentage required to take any action must be approved by the
affirmative vote of limited partners whose aggregate outstanding
units constitute not less than the percentage sought to be reduced.
Any amendment that would increase the percentage of units required
to remove our general partner must be approved by the affirmative
vote of limited partners whose aggregate outstanding units
constitute not less than 90.0% of outstanding units. Any amendment
that would increase the percentage of units required to call a
meeting of unitholders must be approved by the affirmative vote of
unitholders whose aggregate outstanding units constitute at least a
majority of the outstanding units.

 Merger,
Sale or Other Disposition of Assets

        A
merger or consolidation of us requires the prior consent of our
general partner. However, our general partner has no duty or
obligation to consent to any merger or consolidation and may
decline to do so free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to us or
the limited partners, including any duty to act in the best
interests of our partnership or our unitholders, other than the
implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair
dealing.

        In
addition, our partnership agreement generally prohibits our general
partner, without the prior approval of the holders of a unit
majority, from causing us to, among other things, sell, exchange or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our
subsidiaries' assets in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation, other
combination or sale of ownership interests of our subsidiaries. Our
general partner may, however, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, or
grant a security interest in all or substantially all of our and
our subsidiaries' assets

29

 

  

Table of Contents

without
that approval. Our general partner may also sell all or
substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets under a
foreclosure or other realization upon those encumbrances without
that approval. Finally, our general partner may consummate any
merger without the prior approval of our unitholders if we are the
surviving entity in the transaction, our general partner has
received an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax
matters, the transaction would not result in a material amendment
to the partnership agreement (other than an amendment that the
general partner could adopt without the consent of the limited
partners), each of our units will be an identical unit of our
partnership following the transaction and the partnership interests
to be issued do not exceed 20.0% of our outstanding partnership
interests immediately prior to the transaction.

        If
the conditions specified in our partnership agreement are
satisfied, our general partner may convert us or any of our
subsidiaries into a new limited liability entity or merge us or any
of our subsidiaries into, or convey all of our assets to, a newly
formed limited liability entity, if the sole purpose of that
conversion, merger or conveyance is to effect a mere change in our
legal form into another limited liability entity, our general
partner has received an opinion of counsel regarding limited
liability and tax matters and the governing instruments of the new
entity provide the limited partners and our general partner with
the same rights and obligations as contained in our partnership
agreement. Our unitholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights
of appraisal under our partnership agreement or applicable Delaware
law in the event of a conversion, merger or consolidation, a sale
of substantially all of our assets or any other similar transaction
or event.

 Termination
and Dissolution

        We
will continue as a limited partnership until dissolved under our
partnership agreement. We will dissolve upon:

•

the
withdrawal or removal of our general partner or any other event
that results in its ceasing to be our general partner other than by
reason of a transfer of its general partner interest in accordance
with our partnership agreement or its withdrawal or removal
following the approval and admission of a successor;


•

the
election of our general partner to dissolve us, if approved by the
holders of units representing a unit majority;


•

the entry
of a decree of judicial dissolution of our partnership; or


•

there
being no limited partners, unless we are continued without
dissolution in accordance with the Delaware Act.

        Upon
a dissolution under the first clause above, the holders of a unit
majority may also elect, within specific time limitations, to
continue our business on the same terms and conditions described in
our partnership agreement and appoint as a successor general
partner an entity approved by the holders of units representing a
unit majority, subject to our receipt of an opinion of counsel to
the effect that:

•

the action
would not result in the loss of limited liability of any limited
partner; and


•

neither we
nor any of our subsidiaries would be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for
federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of that right to
continue (to the extent not already so treated or
taxed).

 Liquidation
and Distribution of Proceeds

        Upon
our dissolution, unless we are continued as a limited partnership,
the liquidator authorized to wind up our affairs will, acting with
all of the powers of our general partner that are necessary or
appropriate, liquidate our assets and apply the proceeds of the
liquidation as described in "Provisions

30

 

  

Table of Contents

of Our
Partnership Agreement Relating to Cash
Distributions—Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation." The
liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of our assets for
a reasonable period of time if it determines that an immediate sale
or distribution would be impractical or would cause undue loss to
our partners. The liquidator may distribute our assets, in whole or
in part, in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical
or would cause undue loss to the partners.

 Withdrawal
or Removal of Our General Partner

        Except
as described below, our general partner has agreed not to withdraw
voluntarily as our general partner prior to December 31, 2022
without obtaining the approval of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding common units, excluding common units
held by the general partner and its affiliates, and furnishing an
opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax matters. On
or after December 31, 2022, our general partner may withdraw
as general partner without first obtaining approval of any
unitholder by giving at least 90 days' written notice, and
that withdrawal will not constitute a violation of our partnership
agreement. Notwithstanding the information above, our general
partner may withdraw without unitholder approval upon 90 days'
notice to the limited partners if at least 50.0% of the outstanding
common units are held or controlled by one person and its
affiliates, other than our general partner and its affiliates. In
addition, our partnership agreement permits our general partner in
some instances to sell or otherwise transfer all of its general
partner interest in us without the approval of the unitholders.
Please read "—Transfer of General Partner Interest" and
"—Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights."

        Upon
withdrawal of our general partner under any circumstances, other
than as a result of a transfer by our general partner of all or a
part of its general partner interest in us, the holders of a unit
majority may select a successor to that withdrawing general
partner. If a successor is not elected, or is elected but an
opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax matters
cannot be obtained, we will be dissolved, wound up and liquidated,
unless within a specified period of time after that withdrawal, the
holders of a unit majority agree in writing to continue our
business and to appoint a successor general partner. Please read
"—Termination and Dissolution."

        Our
general partner may not be removed unless that removal is approved
by the vote of the holders of not less than 66
2
/
3
% of all
outstanding units, voting together as a single class, including
units held by our general partner and its affiliates, and we
receive an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax
matters. Any removal of our general partner is also subject to the
approval of a successor general partner by the vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding common units The ownership of more
than 33 1
/
3
% of the
outstanding units by our general partner and its affiliates gives
them the ability to prevent our general partner's
removal.

        Our
partnership agreement also provides that if our general partner is
removed as our general partner under circumstances where cause does
not exist and units held by the general partner and its affiliates
are not voted in favor of that removal our general partner will
have the right to convert its general partner interest and its
incentive distribution rights into common units or receive cash in
exchange for those interests based on the fair market value of
those interests as of the effective date of its removal.

        In
the event of removal of our general partner under circumstances
where cause exists or withdrawal of our general partner where that
withdrawal violates our partnership agreement, a successor general
partner will have the option to purchase the general partner
interest and incentive distribution rights of the departing general
partner for a cash payment equal to the fair market value of those
interests. Under all other circumstances where our general partner
withdraws or is removed by the limited partners, the departing
general partner will have the option to require the successor
general partner to purchase the general partner interest of the
departing general partner and its incentive distribution rights for
their fair market value. In each case, this fair market value will
be determined by

31

 

  

Table of Contents

agreement
between the departing general partner and the successor general
partner. If no agreement is reached, an independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert selected by the departing
general partner and the successor general partner will determine
the fair market value. Or, if the departing general partner and the
successor general partner cannot agree upon an expert, then an
expert chosen by agreement of the experts selected by each of them
will determine the fair market value.

        If
the option described above is not exercised by either the departing
general partner or the successor general partner, the departing
general partner's general partner interest and its incentive
distribution rights will automatically convert into common units
equal to the fair market value of those interests as determined by
an investment banking firm or other independent expert selected in
the manner described in the preceding paragraph.

        In
addition, we will be required to reimburse the departing general
partner for all amounts due to it, including, without limitation,
all employee-related liabilities, including severance liabilities,
incurred in connection with the termination of any employees
employed by the departing general partner or its affiliates for our
benefit.

 Transfer
of General Partner Interest

        Except
for transfer by our general partner of all, but not less than all,
of its general partner interest to:

•

an
affiliate of our general partner (other than an individual); or


•

another
entity as part of the merger or consolidation of our general
partner with or into another entity or the transfer by our general
partner of all or substantially all of its assets to such
entity,

our
general partner may not transfer all or any of its general partner
interest to another person prior to December 31, 2022 without
the approval of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding common units, excluding common units held by our
general partner and its affiliates. As a condition of this
transfer, the transferee must, among other things, assume the
rights and duties of our general partner, agree to be bound by the
provisions of our partnership agreement and furnish an opinion of
counsel regarding limited liability and tax matters.

        Our
general partner and its affiliates may, at any time, transfer units
to one or more persons, without unitholder approval.

 Transfer
of Ownership Interests in Our General Partner

        At
any time, the owners of our general partner may sell or transfer
all or part of their ownership interests in our general partner to
an affiliate or a third party without the approval of our
unitholders.

 Transfer
of Incentive Distribution Rights

        Our
general partner may transfer any or all of its incentive
distribution rights to an affiliate or a third party without
unitholder approval. 

 Change
of Management Provisions

        Our
partnership agreement contains specific provisions that are
intended to discourage a person or group from attempting to remove
our general partner or otherwise change our management. Please read
"—Withdrawal or Removal of Our General Partner" for a
discussion of certain consequences of the removal of our general
partner. If any person or group, other than our general partner and
its affiliates, acquires beneficial ownership of 20.0% or more of
any class of units, that person or group loses voting rights on all
of its units. This loss of voting rights does not apply to any
person or group

Table of Contents

that
acquires the units directly from our general partner or its
affiliates or any transferee of that person or group that is
approved by our general partner or to any person or group who
acquires the units with the prior approval of the board of
directors of our general partner. Please read "—Meetings;
Voting."

 Limited
Call Right

        If
at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than
80.0% of the then-issued and outstanding limited partner interests
of any class, our general partner will have the right, which it may
assign in whole or in part to any of its affiliates or to us, to
acquire all, but not less than all, of the remaining limited
partner interests of the class held by unaffiliated persons as of a
record date to be selected by our general partner, on at least 10,
but not more than 60, days' notice. The purchase price in the event
of this purchase is the greater of:

•

the
highest price paid by our general partner or any of its affiliates
for any limited partner interests of the class purchased within the
90 days preceding the date on which our general partner first
mails notice of its election to purchase those limited partner
interests; and


•

the
average of the daily closing prices of the partnership interests of
such class for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the date
three days before the date the notice is mailed.

        As
a result of our general partner's right to purchase outstanding
limited partner interests, a holder of limited partner interests
may have his limited partner interests purchased at an undesirable
time or price. The tax consequences to a unitholder of the exercise
of this call right are the same as a sale by that unitholder of his
common units in the market. Please read "Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences—Disposition of Common
Units."

 Meetings;
Voting

        Except
as described below regarding a person or group owning 20.0% or more
of any class of units then outstanding, unitholders who are record
holders of units on the record date will be entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, meetings of our limited partners and to act upon
matters for which approvals may be solicited.

        Our
general partner does not anticipate that any meeting of unitholders
will be called in the foreseeable future. Any action that is
required or permitted to be taken by the unitholders may be taken
either at a meeting of the unitholders or without a meeting if
consents in writing describing the action so taken are signed by
holders of the number of units necessary to authorize or take that
action at a meeting. Meetings of the unitholders may be called by
our general partner or by unitholders owning at least 20.0% of the
outstanding units of the class for which a meeting is proposed.
Unitholders may vote either in person or by proxy at meetings. The
holders of a majority of the outstanding units of the class or
classes for which a meeting has been called, represented in person
or by proxy, will constitute a quorum unless any action by the
unitholders requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of
the units, in which case the quorum will be the greater percentage.
The units representing the general partner interest are units for
distribution and allocation purposes, but do not entitle our
general partner to any vote other than its rights as general
partner under our partnership agreement, will not be entitled to
vote on any action required or permitted to be taken by the
unitholders and will not count toward or be considered outstanding
when calculating required votes, determining the presence of a
quorum, or for similar purposes.

 Table of Contents

        Each
record holder of a unit has a vote according to its percentage
interest in us, although additional limited partner interests
having special voting rights could be issued. Please read
"—Issuance of Additional Partnership Interests." However, if
at any time any person or group, other than our general partner and
its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of
our general partner or its affiliates, acquires, in the aggregate,
beneficial ownership of 20.0% or more of any class of units then
outstanding, that person or group will lose voting rights on all of
its units and the units may not be voted on any matter and will not
be considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting
of unitholders, calculating required votes, determining the
presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes. Common units
held in nominee or street name account will be voted by the broker
or other nominee in accordance with the instruction of the
beneficial owner unless the arrangement between the beneficial
owner and its nominee provides otherwise.

        Any
notice, demand, request, report or proxy material required or
permitted to be given or made to record holders of common units
under our partnership agreement will be delivered to the record
holder by us or by the transfer agent.

 Status
as Limited Partner

        By
transfer of common units in accordance with our partnership
agreement, each transferee of common units will be admitted as a
limited partner with respect to the common units transferred when
such transfer and admission are reflected in our books and records.
Except as described above under "—Limited Liability," the
common units will be fully paid, and unitholders will not be
required to make additional contributions.

 Redemption
of Ineligible Holders

        In
order to avoid any material adverse effect on the maximum
applicable rates that can be charged to customers by our
subsidiaries on assets that may be subject to rate regulation by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or an analogous regulatory
body in the future, each transferee of common units, upon becoming
the record holder of such common units, will automatically certify,
and the general partner at any time can request such unitholder to
re-certify:

•

that the
transferee or unitholder is an individual or an entity subject to
United States federal income taxation on the income generated by
us; or


•

that, if
the transferee unitholder is an entity not subject to United States
federal income taxation on the income generated by us, as in the
case, for example, of a mutual fund taxed as a regulated investment
company or a partnership, all the entity's owners are subject to
United States federal income taxation on the income generated by
us.

        Furthermore,

of any property, including any gove
