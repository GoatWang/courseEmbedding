Gerrymandering in Politics




Gerrymandering is the manipulation of the boundaries of voting districts in a way that favors one political party, usually by dividing up groups of opposing voters. The U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to draw congressional districts. Very often whichever party has power in the legislature gerrymanders in its own favor. The majority of legal experts agree that gerrymandering is unfair, but is there any legal way around the Constitution? In 2015, the United States Supreme Court heard a case about the state of Arizona’s strategy for avoiding gerrymandering. Listen to this audio story to learn about the arguments for and against an approach to redistricting that does not involve the legislature.

International Border Disputes 
Google Maps is playing an unexpected role in modern-day disputes over borders, or so called "border wars." In 2010, Nicaragua claimed the Costa Rican island of Isla Calero and defended its actions by pointing out that Google Maps showed the island as Nicaraguan. A year later, the Netherlands complained that Google Maps gave land claimed by the Netherlands around the Ems River to Germany. Google says its Maps tool is only for “entertainment purposes”, and should not be used to make “territorial, political, or military decisions.” This public radio story explores how satellite mapping has changed border disputes.

Modern campaigning can get pretty dirty, but politicians today are only taking their cues from politicians in ancient Athens. This public radio story describes how direct democracy was carried out in ancient Athens, a Greek city-state.

Town Government
The tradition of town meeting day has faded away in most states. This public radio story describes a Town Meeting in Starksboro, Vermont, and puts it in the context of the longstanding tradition of town meeting in New England, which began in the 1600s. While it can be difficult to give 100 people all the time they want to debate issues and air their opinions, let alone come to an agreement on them, town meeting remains a vitally important institution that its members value. This story looks at what makes it work.

Separation of Powers
The United States Constitution gives specific powers to each branch of government. This separation of powers between the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches is meant to prevent one branch from becoming too powerful. In the last decade, the Legislative branch has been unnerved by the growth of Executive power under President Bush and President Obama.

Language Challenge


These levels of listening complexity can help teachers choose stories for their students. The levels do not relate to the content of the story, but to the complexity of the vocabulary, sentence structure and language in the audio story.



Low
These stories are easier to understand and are a good starting point for elementary students or English learners.





Medium
These stories have an average language challenge for middle and high school students, and can be scaffolded for English learners.





High
These stories have challenging vocabulary and language and students may need to have some background knowledge to understand the story.

How Listenwise Works









Listening is powerful.
Why practice listening?  Because listening comprehension is fundamental to literacy.
Research shows that if you are not a good listener, you won’t be a good reader. And since students can generally listen 2-3 grade levels above what they can read, we can use the power of listening to introduce more complex language, vocabulary and topics.

Many English Learners are not acquiring the level of academic language needed for college and career readiness.
Are we underestimating the impact that ongoing work with oral academic language can have?
Once students are in middle or high school they are expected to learn increasingly complex content, often without the prerequisite English language proficiency. Listening has the power to help all students access more complex topics and language.

Listening to Authentic Oral Language
Listening and Literacy

 Listen Celebrates 20 years of Innovation			 May 6, 2015/in Company News /by ZarinaListen Inc is proud to announce its 20th year as a leading provider of audio test and measurement systems and expertise. Two decades of innovation and steady growth have made Listen’s flagship product, SoundCheck, an industry-standard audio test system in the consumer electronics industry.
The company is commemorating the occasion with updated branding – a new, more modern, logo and a new website, www.listeninc.com.
Listen began operations in 1995 when a consulting client of Steve Temme, company founder and president, challenged him to build a computer-based system with the same capabilities as the hardware system that they currently owned. This challenge came with a promise that if Steve could produce the system within 6 months he would buy it. Steve met the challenge, the product was named ‘SoundCheck’, and the customer purchased 12 systems. Steve then began to further develop the product to meet the test requirements of a wider audience.
Although the first generation of SoundCheck was designed specifically for testing military headsets, the next version was designed with a very open architecture which allowed virtually any audio device to be tested. It is this open architecture which has, in part, led to Listen’s success as the system has inherently been able to adapt to the changing test requirements of the audio industry over the past 2 decades. For example, in the 1990’s, SoundCheck was primarily used for testing loudspeaker and microphones, but today its most common applications are testing headphones, microspeakers, smartphones, tablets and Bluetooth devices.
Although Listen has its roots firmly in software, today Listen also offers turnkey systems with a complete line of audio test hardware. Designed from the ground up, Listen’s hardware products are engineered to specifically meet the needs of the audio test industry, thus making them reliable, simple to use and cost effective, as well as tightly integrated with Listen’s software.
Listen is still owned and managed by Steve Temme, and is headquartered in an 8000 square foot facility in the South End of Boston, within a mile of where the company started 20 years ago. Listen also has sales and application engineers on the West Coast, and a worldwide sales and support network. Listen is still growing steadily, and has several open positions in both engineering and sales.
“We at Listen, Inc. are thankful to our many customers for making this anniversary possible,” said Steve Temme, president of Listen, Inc. “Their feedback has driven product development and helped us evolve as a company. We look forward to continuing to innovate with our products and test methods, and to serving our valued customers for many years to come.”

The Best Ideas Happen When You Stop Thinking About Yourself (And Do This Instead)


A great idea is a good start, but to really succeed as an entrepreneur, you need to listen carefully to your customers.






 By Alex Chriss


Alex Chriss is the Chief Product Officer, Small Business Group at Intuit. He focuses on serving the global population of independent contractors, solopreneurs, freelancers and self-employed businesses of one, and helped launch QuickBooks Self-Employed in January 2015.

American entrepreneurship is booming.
An unprecedented 55 million Americans count themselves among the self-employed, and Generation Y, a fully "digital generation," is poised to become "the most entrepreneurial generation ever."
With more small business comes more competition, and both solopreneurs and startup founders will face increasing pressure in the marketplace to push the "next big idea." A great idea is a good start, but it's only that.
Turning that great idea into a successful business for the long-term requires entrepreneurs to shift their focus from the merits of their ideas, to the evidence they get from customer behavior.
The phrase "the customer is king" might be a cliche, but it holds great wisdom for those creating products and services. Far too often, entrepreneurs get swept up in their own ideas and forget to keep their eye on what really matters: the customer.
Consider some of the biggest product flops in recent memory. They all had one thing in common: The customers' needs or preferences were all but forgotten.
Take, for example,  Google Glass. In its quest to revolutionize the way we use computers, Google developed the product in a top-secret lab, shielded not only from potential customers but also most Google employees. While Google Glass was admittedly an idea ahead of its time, the customers still haven't come around.
Obtaining valuable customer feedback isn't just about sitting back and listening to customer complaints. It's about becoming actively engaged with the customer, and finding ways to challenge your own assumptions based on the real-world input of customers.
Here are three important lessons on customer feedback and engagement, based on my own experiences:
1. Customers don't always tell you what they want in words.
Often, some of the most surprising insights can come from observing customer behavior.
Two years ago, my team at Intuit noticed that 15 percent of  Mint users were hacking the personal finance product to categorize and track business expenses by creating an "Other" category--a feature that  hadn't been designed into the product.
We realized after talking with customers that we lacked a finance management product tailored to the needs of solopreneurs (i.e. freelancers, contractors, businesses of one). In response, we built an entirely new product, QuickBooks Self-Employed, catering to this segment of individuals with unique financial needs compared to those of full-fledged small businesses.
2. Customers can help you fix "impossible" problems.
In many cases, the solution to a difficult problem can be found in customer data.
Shortly after launching QuickBooks Self-Employed, customers complained that bank transactions in the product were limited to 90 days of history (a bank requirement) and they needed 12 months of data for tax purposes.
Knowing that we needed more data to make this feature happen, we asked customers to manually download data from banks and send it to us. Once we had a sufficient number of these files, we could analyze them, learn the myriad formats, figure out how to grab the data ourselves, and turn that intelligence into a feature.
Developing the feature took just two weeks, but it wouldn't have been possible if we hadn't obtained this essential customer data from our first scrappy iteration.
3. What customers don't do can be equally important.
Taking notice of what customers are not doing can help identify critical holes in your product offerings, as well as the areas where opportunity is ripe.
For example, my team saw that freelancers were missing out on approximately $7.4 billion in potential tax savings every year by not claiming all of the deductions available to them (according to the United States Government Accountability Office). As a result, we built a new feature called ExpenseFinder that automatically found deductible business expenses.
Helping customers get back money is a sure-fire way to make them happy.
Some additional quick tips to help you on your product journey:
 If you plan to monetize your product, do it early; it's an easy way to see if you're creating real value before you go too far down the wrong path. Take the time to sit down with customers in-person (at Intuit, we call these "follow-me-homes"). Customers are more likely to be frank and truthful when you meet with them in their own environment and face-to-face, and you'll get important context that's often missing in surveys and polls. Have your entire product team (especially those close to the product development process, like engineers and designers) take turns answering customer support questions. Talking to a real customer about a problem can be scary at first, but solving for issues in real-time will energize your team and you'll find it's a powerful way to feel connected to the customer.

Listen Technologies to Transition Distribution of Televic Conference Product Line to Aveo Systems Inc.
Posted on March 29, 2016
– Listen Technologies to focus on innovative product development for assistive listening –
BLUFFDALE, UT— March 29, 2016 — Listen Technologies Corporation today announced that effective May 2, 2016, the distribution of the Televic Conference product line in the United States and Canada will be transitioned to Aveo Systems Inc. based in Atlanta, GA. This decision was made to allow Listen Technologies to focus on the growth of its assistive listening systems and wireless personal listening products while enabling Televic Conference products to continue to grow with the focus and industry experience of Aveo Systems.
“With our new products and upcoming releases, Listen Technologies core products are experiencing significant growth. This allows us to focus even more on growing our proprietary product line and continuing to develop solutions that create exceptional user listening experiences,” said Russell Gentner, CEO of Listen Technologies. “We’ve worked closely with Televic during their search for a new distribution partner and are confident that Aveo Systems is the best possible partner for Televic. We have enjoyed our relationship with Televic and are fully committed to a successful transition to continue their success as the leading manufacturer of conference solutions.”
“Both Aveo Systems and Televic are dedicated to improving how users communicate and collaborate, making the Televic Conference products a natural fit with Aveo Systems,” said Dr. Craig Richardson, CEO of Aveo Systems. “With more than 25 years of experience designing and selling audio and video conferencing products to system integration partners, Aveo Systems is excited to leverage its conferencing experience to continue Listen Technologies’ successful growth record with Televic’s conference products in the U.S. and Canada.”
 
“We thank Listen Technologies for their successful introduction and distribution of our products over the past four years, and we are excited about teaming up with them on other projects in the near future,” said Bart Deschodt, General Manager of Televic Conference. “Listen is truly unique in its capacity to educate end customers, consultants, and integrators about the innovative potential of our products, and we learned a lot from them.”
Deschodt continued, “The transition to Aveo Systems is a logical next step for us. With the introduction of our advanced and future-proof Plixus® architecture, applications for our technology increase vastly. The extensive conference expertise and know-how that Aveo Systems brings to the table will allow us to develop a more focused  approach for each application and/or market segment. We are confident that AVEO Systems can bring us to another level and look forward to continuing our U.S. success with Aveo Systems.”

Early-stage investment into Listen Innovation, Inc. USA, specializing in developing online learning materials for schools



Early-stage investment into Listen Innovation, Inc. USA, specializing in developing online learning materials for schools
Anticipating future adoption by schools and teachers to use as an online learning material for ESL (English as second language) users and other students in general due to its strength in non-fiction content, now required in the US national academic standards
October 19, 2016EduLab, Inc.
EduLab, Inc. (Minato-ku Tokyo. President and CEO: Junichi Takamura. Hereafter “EduLab Group”) has carried out a round of early-stage investment into Listen Innovation, Inc. (Massachusetts, USA. CEO: Monica Brady-Myerov. Hereinafter referred to as “Listen Innovation”), which operates “Listenwise”, a product that corresponds to the Common Core State Standards (Common basic standards for each state. Hereinafter referred to as “Common Core”) and is gaining acceptance across the nation to meet the US national academic standards.
＜Listenwise＞ https://listenwise.com/

Investment Background
Anticipating the possibility of rapid growth in the Edtech market in the US with the establishment of the Common Core (2009), we opened an office in the US in 2014 and have conducted market research since then.
Previously, each state in the US sets their own learning goals under their individual governing bodies, but the Common Core, led by the Obama administration in 2009, has already been adopted in 42 of the 50 states in the nation, as well as Washington D.C. and 4 other territories (as of 2016). The Common Core requires that over 70% of the content in all subjects should be non-fiction, which is leading to an acceleration in the introduction of digital learning contents in the US. The EduLab Group decided to support Listen Innovation, which has strength in non-fiction content as well as designing and providing a platform for online learning services, expecting that they will expand their business along with the expansion of the Edtech market.
* Common Core: http://www.corestandards.org/
Overview of Listen Innovation
“Listenwise”, provided by Listen Innovation, is an online learning service which uses content that was actually aired on National Public Radio (hereinafter referred to as NPR), a US public radio broadcast. Much of the NPR material has non-fiction themes, which goes along with the Common Core guidelines, so the content of Listenwise is likewise primarily non-fiction. It is anticipated that Listenwise will gain acceptance at schools and educational institutions as non-fiction school material, which is required by the Common Core, and as learning material for ESL (English as second language).

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks.
