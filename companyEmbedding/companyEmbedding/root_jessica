StyleJessica Alba’s Allergies Mean You Now Get Healthy Hair CareBy Jillian Ruffo•@jillianruffoPosted on August 31, 2016 at 5:14pm EDT

If you already did one big beauty bag purge to make way for Jessica Alba‘s Honest Beauty makeup and skincare products, it’s time to dump everything out of your medicine cabinet to make room for her hair products.
The mother of two has just released a haircare line, and it contains everything you need — from shampoo to salt spray — and ranges from $18-$24 at Ulta and honestbeauty.com. Below, see everything Alba has to say about the line and her own hair routine, and get the first look at her campaign images before you hit the store.
She created products for the girl on the go.
“I don’t have a lot of time, so I need products that are effortless. Whether I’m in the office or with my kids all day, I need products that really work. And if I have a spontaneous date night, I need products that smell good and can quickly transform me from day to night. Because I have so many sensitivities, they also can’t have synthetic fragrances. And on busy days I need products that hold a style all day from the office to photo shoots to the red carpet without making me compromise between looking and feeling good.”

Formulating her the line wasn’t easy.
“It’s incredibly difficult to formulate with botanical ingredients and get the performance you expect from conventional ingredients. It took us a long time to get the formula to be exactly what I had envisioned. I believe that what we use on our hair is equally as important as what we put onto our skin and I felt there was a true need in the market for clean, safe haircare that really works. You shouldn’t have to sacrifice performance to get products you trust.”

She can’t choose just one favorite product.
“I love them all, but I would have to say that my favorites for everyday use are the Beyond Hydrated Shampoo, Beyond Hydrated Conditioner, Moisture Milk Leave-In Conditioner and the Sea Salt Spray. These are my go-to products for that effortless texture look. I am also really excited about the Dry Condition + Shine Serum. It gives your hair a polished shine without adding weight.”

She only washes her roots.
“I don’t have a lot of time to spend getting ready in the morning. I typically shampoo my roots and condition the rest of my hair.”
She’s a master at creating her own bouncy waves. 
“I’ve been getting my hair and makeup done professionally since I was 12 so I’ve had the chance to learn from some of the best stylists. I love a wavy hair look. When I’m out of the shower, I towel dry and spray leave-in conditioner, which is amazing, and then I use our volumizing spray and sea salt spray. I shake dry my hair with a blow dryer. Then I take different size chunks and wrap my hair around a curling iron, leaving the ends out. I go in different directions throughout my hair so the waves are a little messy and effortless.”

Her friends tested all of her products.
“One of the most important things for me was that these products actually performed. I had a lot of my friends, people at the office and professional hairstylists test out the products. We wanted to make sure that they would work for everyone and that they would hold a style from the office to the red carpet.”
Her hair routine has changed drastically since creating her own line.
“I no longer have to spend time searching for products that won’t give me allergies. I finally have products that I absolutely love and products that do everything I need them to do!”

Jessica Alba hair products | Allure































ToggleCloseSubscribeNewsletter Sign UpCloseGoHairJessica Alba Is Launching a Line of Her Own Beachy-Wave EssentialsBy Kristie DashkristiedashMarch 21, 2016facebook dialogPinterestfacebook dialogPinterestEmailNoam Galai/WireImage/Getty ImagesLast week, Jessica Alba introduced the world to what might be the cutest diapers ever. The new Honest Company baby basics are anything but basic. Decorated with images of macarons and the Eiffel Tower, the diapers could actually be called chic. But I didn't attend the launch event for these products because I'm on the baby beat. I went because I wanted to grill cofounder Jessica Alba about every aspect of her beauty routine. What I ended up with, however, was the inside scoop on the company's forthcoming line of Honest Beauty hair products—for grown-ups, of course.When I asked Alba if this was on the record—it was the first I was hearing about it—she said, "I think people know we're coming out with hair care." She went on to list "sea-salt spray," "conditioning milk," "hair oil," and "root lift" as the products she's been experimenting with and loving from the line.You May Also LikeHairThe Best Hair-Care Routine, According to Your Hair ConcernHairShould I Shave My Head to Make My Hair Grow Back Healthier?As for her instructions, "I do the sea-salt spray at the root, and I use conditioning milk at the ends. Then I scrunch. Right before it's completely dry, I'll mist with the oil. It's awesome. We have a hair oil that's like a mist," she said. She recently put them all to the test at the Dior show at Paris fashion week and for the Vanity Fair Oscar party. "The hairdresser used our root lift and all the other products, and it held the whole time. They really work, they really hold, and they smell amazing." As with most of the other scents in the line, the fragrances of the hair products are inspired by Alba's favorite vacation spots and the familiar scents of her childhood.I tried digging for more information, but that's all she would divulge. When I reached out to her team for a comment they could only confirm that the line will launch in October and they would keep us posted. So sit tight, be patient, and look forward to finally having all the ingredients to achieving Jessica Alba's enviable waves at home.Go backstage at New York fashion week with M.A.C. senior artist Keri Blair:Watch this video on The Scene.#KeywordsJessica Albabeachy waveshair products#KeywordsJessica Albabeachy waveshair productsfacebook dialogPinterestEmailCollectionsHot RollersBouncy voluminous curls for every texture.Buy ItReadReviewT3T3 Volumizing Hot Rollers LuxeBuy ItReadReviewDoveDove Oxygen Moisture Leave In FoamReadReviewJohn FriedaJohn Frieda Styling Tools by Conair Body & Shine Smooth WavesReadReviewLiving ProofLiving Proof Hold Flexible HairsprayBuy ItReadReviewConairConair Styling Essentials Thermal Self-Grip RollersIn The NewsA Salon Employee Is Facing Backlash After Temporarily Banning Men While Cutting a Muslim Woman's HairThe employee reportedly hung a sign reading "no men please."July 28, 2017Stand the heatThese Heat Protectants Cost Less Than $20 and Get the Job DONEThese affordable heat protectants replenish moisture, defend against frying, and put the bounce back into wilted strands.July 27, 2017Happy Hair DaysThe Best Hair-Care Routine, According to Your Hair ConcernGet stronger and glossier (and, yes, cleaner) hair.July 27, 2017bald-faced lieWe Asked Dermatologists if Shaving Your Head Makes Hair Grow Back HealthierThere's a major catch.July 26, 2017New Hair, Who Dis?You Need to See The Epic Summer Hair Makeovers We Gave These New YorkersSummer's the perfect time for a hair refresh, no?July 26, 2017BangsSelena Gomez Just Got Side-Swept Bangs — and She Looks AmazingWe're reaching for the scissors.July 26, 2017The Power of NaturalsThe 7 Best Natural Ingredients for Your HairThe oils, clays, and herbs that can transform your hair — and we do mean transform.July 26, 2017The History of WigsWriter Liana Schaffner explores the world of high-end, fantastical, hang-them-in-a-museum wigs.July 26, 2017Sign Up for Our NewsletterGet your daily dose of beauty tips, tricks, and news, sent straight to your inbox.Sign Up NowSubscribe to the Magazine  +  Get a Free Salon Tote!Subscribe NowSubscribe NowBeauty ProductsTHIS Is How Much Allure Editors' Beauty Routines Cost
