 1. What is an analytical balance?  An analytical or semi analytical balance is a form of scale that measures mass to a high degree of precision. It has a weighing capacity in the range of 100-500 g (typically 200 g) and a readability of 0.1 mg – 0.001 mg. Analytical balance sensitivity requires it to be protected by a draft shield or an enclosure.METTLER TOLEDO XPE, XSE and XS analytical balances are equipped with the SmartGrid weighing pan minimising air turbulence and therefore shorten stabilization times and allowing faster weighing results.
 2. Where are analytical balances used? What are the application areas of analytical balances? An analytical balance scale, often called a "lab balance", permits quantitative analysis of a sample. Typical applications of an electronic analytical balance include: Sample/standard preparation, formulation, differential weighing, density determination, interval weighing and pipette routine testing.
 3. How to weigh on an analytical balance? To start a weighing operation, open the door and place a container on the pan using gloves or tweezers.Close the door and wait until the value stabilises, noting the weight. Clear the display by pressing the tare button until it reads 0.0000 g. Add the sample until the desired weight is reached. Close the door and again wait for stability - record the net weight. If the instrument is unplugged for cleaning, allow readjustment time before reuse.METTLER TOLEDO’s analytical balances are designed for easy cleaning with draft shield disassembly in seconds, and dishwasher-safe panels. Cleaning Recommendations and Regulations for Balances
 4. What are the effects of static electricity on an analytical balance and how to eliminate static charges? Electrostatic charges can cause unstable, non-repeatable weighing results. Static electricity exerts a force on the weighing pan, which directly affects analytical balance results. Precautions to reduce these effects include:Ensure adequate air humidity (≥ 45%...50%)If possible, use antistatic weighing containers (metal is ideal)Avoid rubbing containersIf the sample is small enough, use a metal dish with an edge to help shield the electric fieldsTo ensure analytical balance static elimination, discharge the sample and container with an ionizer before weighing.Read additional information on electrostatic charges and the physics behind it.  
 5. What is analytical balance uncertainty? When making measurements there is always an element of uncertainty. An estimate of doubt that surrounds it (the uncertainty) is key to any measurement. This is determined by measuring the performance of the balance, properties of the weighing object and environmental surroundings. Determination of measurement uncertainty is an integral part of a balance calibration.
 6. Why should I calibrate my analytical balance? Analytical balance calibration ensures that weighing equipment is accurate and satisfies standards such as ISO, GLP/GMP, IFS, and BRC. Documented calibration procedures indicate the quality of measurements, and should be performed regularly throughout the balance’s lifetime.Calibration should not be confused with adjustment of a balance, and must be repeated after adjustment/repairs. Read more on Calibration.
 6. How should I calibrate my analytical balance? The calibration of an analytical balance is performed by an authorized service technician following a standard procedure, using calibration software:Establish how well the instrument performs by testing the relationship between measurement standards and indications through calibration. Verify whether the instrument meets specific requirements with a Pass/Fail statement. If requirements are not met, adjust the instrument so that any deviation does not exceed tolerance limits.Re-calibrate the instrument to confirm compliance with specified tolerances.In between calibration intervals, routine testing by the user can detect potential issues.METTLER TOLEDO has developed a global scientific standard for the secure selection, calibration and operation of weighing equipment, GWP®, or Good Weighing Practice™.
 7. Which tolerances apply to balance calibration? Tolerances determine whether a balance or scale behaves "well enough" to meet a particular set of process requirements. Tolerances set the criteria to issue a Pass/Fail statement. Tolerances come from a variety of sources, including:Legal tolerances:Legal tolerances stipulated by OIML R76 or NIST Handbook 44 (US only) assess legal for trade requirements. These tolerances are quite large and easily met with laboratory balances, or when weighing at the lower end of the measurement range.Manufacturer tolerances:Manufacturer tolerances ensure that equipment meets manufacturer specifications. Manufacturer tolerances do not consider user specific process requirements, and are unsuitable for improving the weighing process.Process tolerances: Specific process tolerances defined by the user, support process improvements and savings on material, waste and rework. For scales in a legal for trade application, process tolerances should therefore be applied in addition to legal tolerances. Legal tolerances protect consumers but do not consider specific producer requirements. Optimising process tolerances that are applied to measuring instruments can have a large impact on process profitability.
 8. What is the analytical balance minimum weight? Every analytical balance minimum weight is different, depending on the performance of the load cell, its location, and ambient conditions. The minimum weight is the accuracy limit of the instrument, below this minimum weight, the relative measurement uncertainty (absolute measurement uncertainty divided by the load, usually indicated in %) is larger than the required weighing accuracy, and the weighing result cannot be trusted.In order to determine the minimum weight for a balance, measurement uncertainty needs to be assessed in the working environment. Alternatively repeatability, as the dominant source of error in the lower balance range, can be assessed to determine the minimum weight, carried out using a small weight, below 5% of balance capacity.The MinWeigh function of METTLER TOLEDO analytical balances, installed by a certified technician, monitors the minimum sample weight of the balance. If a weighing is below the determined acceptable minimum value, the balance display turns red.
 9. Analytical balance accuracy and precision – what is the difference and how to test them? Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other. Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a known value, and is based on readability, repeatability, non-linearity and eccentricity. Accuracy can be tested usingAn external reference weight with a known mass (traceable calibrated weight)Automatic internal adjustment using a reference mass built into the balanceAccuracy can only be determined by testing of the instrument at its location of use.

 1. Microbalance - what are they? A micro balance or ultra-microbalance can deliver the highest precision of all lab balances. This high sensitivity in micro balance design allows for the weighing of sample quantities with weight as low as 30 μg.  Microbalances offer a capacity of up to 10.1 g with readability down to 1 µg (0.000001g). Ultra microbalances offer an incredible full resolution of 61 million digits, with a capacity of 6.1 g and 0.1 µg readability (0.0000001g).Ordinary nameAccuracy classReadability  Number of digits after decimal position (g)Ultra microbalance I0.1 μg0.0000001 g7 digits or decimal placesMicrobalance I1 μg0.000001 g6 digits or decimal placesSemi microbalance I0.01 mg0.00001 g5 digits or decimal placesMETTLER TOLEDO’s portfolio includes a micro-analytical balance. It has a readability like a micro balance, 1 µg, andd the shape of an analytical balance, with an outer and inner weighing chamber.The XPE micro-analytical balances deliver the highest capacity, coupled with the lowest possible minimum weight . This enables dosing of very small amounts directly into a "large" tare containers.
 2. What is special about microbalance design? A micro balance consists of two components - one containing the electronics and the other, the precise mechanical measuring cell. This separation eliminates the effects of temperature and the influence it has on the performance of your micro balance scale.METTLER TOLEDO XPR Micro and Ultra-Microbalances are equipped with an Active Temperature Control system (ATC™). This increases the weighing stability and enables an outstanding level of performance and accuracy.
 3. What is a microbalance used for? Microbalances and ultra microbalances are frequently used in product testing and quality assurance labs, as well as chemistry labs and mining to measure small amounts of powders and minerals. Medical device research might also employ a micro balance to check uniformity in critical components.Micro balance applications include: particulate matter (filter) weighing, pipette calibration, analysis of pesticides, and stent weighing. Ultra micro balance applications include: particulate matter (filter) weighing, ashing or incineration, drying, measurement of coatings, and checking spillage quantities.
 4. Which METTLER TOLEDO microbalance is right for me? To find the appropriate METTLER TOLEDO micro balance for your needs, first define the smallest amount you need to weigh and how accurately you need to weigh it (i.e. acceptable tolerance) to determine the precise micro balance you require.Every measurement on any balance is subject to uncertainty - understanding this uncertainty is key to ensuring accurate results and the avoidance of errors. When weighing small samples on a microbalance, uncertainty is almost entirely due to repeatability (i.e. at the low end of the weighing range of a specific balance). It is not the readability that determines the accuracy of a weighing instrument, but rather its repeatability, or depending on it, its minimum weight capability.Ask your METTLER TOLEDO consultant about GWP® Recommendation which helps you select the right weighing instrument for your own individual requirements. 
 5. What are the challenges and solutions to get stable measurements on a microbalance? A micro balance is an extremely sensitive instrument – the slightest disturbance caused by environmental influences or user interaction can significantly affect measurement stability. All possible sources of vibrations should be avoided when using a micro balance. Microbalances are highly susceptible to air currents, dust, and fluctuations in temperature, and should only be used where ambient temperature and humidity are maintained at a stable level – away from vents, windows, and doors.Ideally the balance should be set-up on a solid workbench - preferably a dedicated weighing table that can remain optimised for micro balance use, free from draughts or high traffic.When a micro balance is first connected to the power supply or switched on, a minimum warm-up time of 6 hours is recommended for ambient temperature adjustment.When using the micro balance, be sure to minimize convection flows inside the weighing chamber, which can negatively impact results. Only handle samples with tweezers, and allow acclimatisation to room temperature. When placing the sample onto the micro balance, the door should be opened to a minimum degree, for as short a time as possible.Follow METTLER TOLEDO’s dedicated guide to weighing, 10 Steps to Successful Micro-Weighingand get further tips on how to deal with challenges when weighing with microbalances, including determining proper balance location and calibration.
 6. How to weigh on a microbalance? Always wear gloves while working with microbalances – fingerprints and oil from hands affect results. To start a weighing operation, open the door and place a container on the pan using tweezers. Close the door and allow the value to stabilize. Tare the micro balance. To avoid spills in the balance remove the container or weighing boat, dose the sample outside the weighing chamber, and place the sample on the weighing pan. Close the door and wait for stability. Record the net weight or repeat the procedure until desired weight is reached. A micro balance is highly sensitive to movement - do not touch the bench while waiting for the balance to stabilize. Clean the balance, tools and workspace after each use.The draft shield of METTLER TOLEDO’s XPR micro balance provides easy 360° access to the weighing pan and all-round visibility. There are no edges or corners where sample material could become trapped, and all parts can be removed, cleaned, and replaced in a few simple steps.
 7. How to perform calibration, adjustment and routine tests of a microbalance? The accuracy of a weighing device is determined by correct micro balance calibration - performed by a qualified service provider only. The calibration certificate proves a micro balance is working correctly, user routine balance testing detects potential issues in performance within a calibration interval.Automated adjustment functions with internal test weights, such as FACT or proFACT, ensure that the balance maintains accuracy, even during fluctuations in ambient temperature.METTLER TOLEDO has developed a globally applicable scientific standard for the secure selection, calibration, and operation of weighing equipment, known as GWP®, or Good Weighing Practice™, and Balance and Scale Calibration and Adjustment – Clarification of Terms

 Request Info  Get a Quote  Mass Comparators from METTLER TOLEDO Continuous Innovation - Accompanying Your Future1. What is the definition of a comparator?A mass comparator or comparator balance is a balance with best possible resolution and repeatability allowing determining even the smallest difference is mass. While window-range mass comparators are purely used for mass calibration and mass determination, full-range mass comparators are versatile and can be used for weight determination but as well for general weighing applications where small samples meet large tare loads or the large and small amounts need to be combined in one weighing process. Contact your local METTLER TOLEDO representative to receive a GWP Recommendation identifying the models suiting your personal needs.2.  What makes mass calibration so different?In a regular weighing process, the balanced is calibrated and the individual weighing are against zero g, therefore the process is called "absolute weighing". With weight calibration, which is a specific type of differential weighing, the reference point is not the calibrated comparator balance; it's the reference weight against which the test weight is compared to. Reference weight need to be at least one weight class higher than the test weight. Each of the reference weights is again calibrated against another weight of higher class resulting to a traceability to the national prototype and finally to the International Prototype of the kilogram at the BIPM in Paris, France.3. What applications are comparators used for?The primary applications where mass comparators are used for is mass calibration. For lower class weights, in particular M 1-3, F1 & 2 classes, manual mass comparators provide results of sufficient accuracy. For weights of E1 or E2 class it is recommended to use either robotic or automated mass comparators as the measurement uncertainty is significantly lower, this mainly due to the obsolescence of the operators influence. In national metrology institutes (NMI's), which strive continuously for measurements with smallest uncertainty, vacuum or constant pressure mass comparators are utilized as these allow performing measurements at constant conditions. Influences such as geographic altitude, air buoyancy or weather conditions can be eliminated. National metrology institutes and metrology research center apply mass comparators for scientific research to measure smallest changes in mass or force.Besides the metrology application mass comparator are as well in use in other industries where the performance of a regular balance cannot meet the customer demand. For these applications the comparators are referred to as higher performance balances.Some of these industrial applications are:Formulation – if tolerance levels are low and the save weighing range of the balance does not fulfil the instrument demandsDifferential weighing applications – if the difference in mass is very small and an ordinary balance cannot provide trustworthy resultsGas filling – Heavy gas bottles are filled with a small amount of precious reference gasScuffing – Gears are analyzed on abrasion after the engine was run for a specified time in the lubricant of investigationForce measurements – Measurements where an applied force is compensated by the weighing cell 4. What is the difference between a mass comparator and a balance?Mass Comparators are of identical design and principle as an electronic balance. What differentiates the balance to the comparator is the performance, in particular the readability and repeatability.Precision Balance with 1 kg capacity and 1 mg readabilityManual mass comparator / Higher performance balance with 1 kg capacity and 0.1 mg readabilityWindow-range mass comparator 1 kg capacity and 0.01 mg readabilityAutomated mass comparator 1 kg capacity and 0.001 mg readabilityConstant/ Vacuum mass comparators 1 kg capacity and 0.0001 mg readabilityRegular laboratory balances are specified by the main properties repeatability (RP), eccentricity (EC), nonlinearity (NL) and sensitivity (SE). As weight calibration is subject of differential weighing mass comparators are additionally specified with differential weighing repeatability ABA (RP ABA). 5. How to calibrate a mass comparator?According to regulations, Mass Comparators in use for mass calibration do not need to be calibrated, as the reference weight is calibrated and ensures for traceability to the BIPM and the definition of the kilogram. To protect your investment and ensure continuous constant measurement performance, METTLER TOELDO recommends performing preventive maintenance on a routine base.Where mass comparators are in use in applications different than weight calibration, it is crucial to apply existing quality standards on the XPR-C balances, identical to other analytical or precision balances.  OverviewServicesPublicationsMC LinkMore InformationOverviewServicesPublicationsMC LinkMore Information

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
will go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses 
relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security 
holders.


The primary source of competition will come from various service providers 
such as business plan writers, auditors, lawyers, marketing firms as well as 
many other types of service providers. In addition those startups and 
development stage companies that have the resources and inclination to handle 
these tasks in-house will not need our services. 

There are also numerous established firms that offer some combination of 
marketing, promotional and general consulting services to startup and 
development stage companies in the industry. In addition, there are a number 
of large and well-established general marketing agencies that provide strategy 
and implementation services to the industry as well as a number of other 
industries. We are a new entry into this competitive market and may struggle 
to differentiate ourselves as a specialist that provides more value for startup 
and development stage companies.


Company Description
Incorporated on June 5, 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware, Balance 
Labs, Inc. is a consulting firm that provides business development and 
consulting services to start up and development stage businesses. The company 
offers services to help businesses in various industries improve and


 fine tune 
their business models, sales and marketing plans and internal operations as 
well as make introductions to professional services such as business plan 
writing, accounting firms and legal service providers. 

We leverage our knowledge in developing businesses with entrepreneurs and 
start up companies’ management whereby we create a customized plan for them 
to overcome obstacles so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) 
and/or service(s) to their potential customers.

	BALANCE
	LABS, INC.








	Notes
	to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements






	As
	of September 30, 2016






	(Unaudited)





	 





	Note
	1 – Business Organization and Nature of Operations





	 




	Balance
	Labs, Inc. (“Balance Labs” or the “Company”) was incorporated on June 5, 2014 under the laws of the State
	of Delaware. Balance Labs is a consulting firm that provides business development and consulting services to start up and development
	stage businesses. The Company offers services to help businesses in various industries improve and fine tune their business models,
	sales and marketing plans and internal operations as well as make introductions to professional services such as business plan
	writing, accounting firms and legal service providers.




	 




	The
	Company leverages its knowledge in developing businesses with entrepreneurs and start up companies’ management whereby it
	creates a customized plan for them to overcome obstacles so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s)
	to their potential customers.




	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they
	do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
	management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary
	for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial position of Balance Labs as of September 30, 2016 and
	the unaudited condensed consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
	unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative
	of the operating results for the full year. It is recommended that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
	be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related disclosures of the Company for the year ended December
	31, 2015 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.




	 





	Note
	2 – Going Concern





	 



	The attached financial statements have
	been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered losses from operations and has a
	net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company used $478,823
	of cash in operating activities and currently has $131,813 in cash. This will sustain the Company for only 3.9 months without
	additional funds. Management plans to raise additional capital within the next two months that will sustain its operations for
	the next year. In addition, the company will begin an active marketing campaign to market its services.



	 





	Note
	3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	 







	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents







	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
	At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates may include those pertaining to stock-based compensation and deferred tax
	assets. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.




	 





	Concentrations
	and Credit Risk





	 




	One
	customer provided 100% of revenues during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.




	 







	 



	6



	 






	 




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue related to its professional services to its customers when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
	exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability
	is reasonably assured.




	 




	The
	Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740-10, which prescribes a recognition
	threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
	taken in a tax return.




	 




	Management
	has evaluated and concluded that there is material tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s financial statements
	as of September 30, 2016. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months
	of the reporting date.




	 




	The
	Company’s policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest as interest expense and penalties as general
	and administrative expenses in the statement of operations.




	 





	Investment
	– Related Party





	 




	Investment
	– related party is recorded at fair value on September 30, 2016. The Company holds its investments as available for sale
	securities.




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 



	The consolidated financial statements include
	the company’s majority owned entities, all two wholly owned corporate subsidiaries (Balance Labs LLC., from April 15, 2016,
	Balance AgroTech Co., from January 11, 2016). All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated.





	 





	Net
	Loss Per Common Share





	 




	Basic
	and diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares and warrants
	from convertible debentures outstanding during the periods. The effect of 2,920,000 and 320,000 warrants and 2,120,000 and 0 shares
	from convertible notes payable for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively were anti dilutive and not
	included in dilutive loss per share.




	 





	Stock-Based
	Compensation





	 




	The
	Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award.
	For employees, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is
	generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value
	amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually
	the vesting period. Awards granted to directors are treated on the same basis as awards granted to employees.




	 




	The
	Company has computed the fair value of warrants granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term used for
	warrants is the contractual life. Since the Company’s stock has not been publicly traded for a sufficiently long period
	of time, the Company is utilizing an expected volatility figure based on a review of the historical volatilities, over a period
	of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being valued, of similarly positioned public companies within its industry.
	The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term
	consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued.

	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. For certain of our financial instruments, including
	cash, accounts payable, and the short-term portion of long-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their
	short maturities.




	 




	We
	adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). The adoption did not have a material
	impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for
	measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather
	applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to
	measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
	market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the
	service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
	valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar
	assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are
	not active.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed
	by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.






	 




	The
	following table presents certain assets of the Company’s measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance
	sheet on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016.

	Advertising,

	the accompanying statement of operations. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September
	30, 2015, advertising, marketing and promotion expense was $6,595 in 2016 and $0 in 2015, respectively.




	 





	Reclassifications





	 




	Certain
	prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the fiscal 2016 presentation. These reclassifications
	have no impact on the previously reported net loss.




	 





	Recently
	Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	The
	Company has evaluated all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact its condensed consolidated financial statements
	and does not believe that there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact
	on its financial position or results of operations.




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	, which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize
	(i) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
	basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of,
	a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors;
	however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard
	will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We
	are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash
	flows or financial condition.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
	Accounting

	, which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of
	the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards
	as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing the provisions
	of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.




	 




	In
	April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016–10 Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606): identifying Performance Obligations
	and Licensing ” .The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the
	amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
	implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on
	(a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity’s
	promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied
	at a point in time) or a right to access the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments
	in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement
	necessary to comply with Topic 606. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact
	on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

	Overview





	 




	We
	were incorporated on June 5, 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a consulting firm that provides business development
	and consulting services to startup and development-stage companies. We provide businesses in various industries with customized
	consulting services to meet their business needs and help them improve their business models, sales and marketing plans and internal
	operations, as well as introduce these businesses to experienced professional contacts that would be vital to the success of these
	companies. The Company is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940
	Act”) and does not engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. The Company is
	not managed like an active investment vehicle, is not an investment company registered under the 1940 Act, and is not required
	to register under the 1940 Act.




	 




	Our
	business focuses on providing advice to entrepreneurs and assisting business owners so that their ideas can be fully developed
	and implemented. Due to limited resources, lack of experienced management and competing priorities, startup and developmental
	stage companies are not operating as efficiently as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party that could
	assist in developing and executing certain strategies. We utilize our knowledge in developing businesses, share practical experiences
	with our clients and introduce the business owners to experienced professionals who could help these inexperienced entrepreneurs
	further implement their ideas. Startups and development stage businesses across all industries commonly experience these certain
	“growing pains”.




	 







	 



	12



	 






	 




	 





	Plan
	of Operations





	 




	Our
	plan is to prepare our clients for the many inevitable challenges they will encounter and to develop a customized plan for them
	to help overcome these obstacles, so that they can focus on marketing their product(s) and/or service(s) to their potential customers.




	 




	Although
	we’ve only worked with one client since inception, our goal is to add and service a minimum of two to three new clients
	between now and the end of 2016. We’re marketing our services through both personal contact and online by (a) mining our
	existing network of professional contacts via personal outreach programs, which will also target international prospects that
	may wish to enter the US market; (b) expanding our network by attending targeted conferences and professional gatherings; and
	(c) utilizing our website at www.balancelabs.co, plus engaging potential clients on social media, including LinkedIn, Facebook
	and Twitter. However, because we have a limited budget allocated for an on-line marketing campaign, we anticipate that professionals
	within our professional network and personal referrals from companies that are satisfied with our professional services are likely
	to be our most significant and efficient near-term form of marketing.




	 






	During
	the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company activated two subsidiaries, Balance Labs, LLC, Balance AgroTech Co. BalanceLabs
	LLC, is strictly a management company that provides necessary administrative services to small companies.




	 




	We
	believe that we can support our year one clients with our existing full-time staff, supplemented with part-time sub-contracted
	professionals and service providers, as necessary. Between now and the end of 2016, we intend to formalize our relationships with
	these sub-contractors so that we can offer our clients turn-key business development products and services.




	 




	Our
	primary requirement for funding is for working capital in order to accommodate temporary imbalances between cash receipts and
	cash expenditures (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).




	 





	Acquisition





	 




	On
	April 4, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary Balance AgroTech Co., entered into an agreement with Pimi Agro Cleantech Ltd. (Pimi)
	where the shareholders of Pimi would exchange 100% of their shares for 15,400,000 Series A Preferred Shares in Balance Agrotech
	Co. The preferred shares will pay a cash dividend of 2.5% or 5% PIK dividend at the election of the company. The Company will
	use its best efforts for the filing of documents to allow the public trading of the Company’s common shares. The stated
	value of the preferred shares is $1.00. The original agreement called for a closing within 45 days from April 4, 2016. The agreement
	has been extended. A closing is planned for January, 2017.

	Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015





	 





	Overview





	 




	We
	reported a net loss of $717,292 and $240,066 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase
	of $477,226 or 199%, primarily due to a $39,000 reduction in revenues and increased interest expense of $294,872. For the three
	months ended September 30, 2016 we reported a loss of $311,263 and a loss of $92,527 for the three months ended September 30,
	2015, an increase of $218,736 or 236%. This was mainly due to an increase in interest expense and professional fees.




	 





	Revenues





	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated no revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we generated $39,000
	from an entity which our CEO has an indirect 19% interest. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated no revenue
	as compared to no revenue for the same period, the previous year.




	 





	General
	and administrative expenses





	 





	General and administrative expenses
	were $98,346 and $100,453 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $2,107 or 2%. For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, general and administrative expenses were $46,764 and $8,866, an increase of
	$37,898 or 428%. The increase cost was a result of higher accounting, consulting and transfer agent fees.

	Interest
	expense





	 




	Interest
	expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $295,408 and $536, respectively, which was attributable to the
	short term advances provided by our CEO, and the amortization of debt discount on the $25,000 and $500,000 notes. For the three
	months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 interest was $138,001 and $496 respectively, an increase of $137,505. This increase is
	the result of the amortization of debt discount and short term advances as stated above.

	Investment
	Agreement





	 




	On
	April 1, 2016, the Company entered into an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Newel Trading Group
	LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Newel”) whereby Newel is obligated, providing the Company has met certain
	conditions including the filing of a Form S-1 Registration Statement for the shares to be acquired, to purchase up to Twenty-Five
	Million Dollars ($25,000,000) of the Company’s common stock at the rates set forth in the Investment Agreement. Under the
	Investment Agreement, the shares are purchased at the discretion of the Company by issuing a Put Notice when funds are needed.
	In consideration for the execution and delivery of the Investment Agreement, Company issued 1,000,000 non-registrable shares of
	Company’s common stock. The Company also issued Newel 2,000,000 warrants at an exercise price of $3.50.




	 





	Availability
	of Additional Funds





	 




	Except
	for the monthly consulting fee to our CEO and Chairman of the Board and the lease of our office space, as described elsewhere
	in this Quarterly Report, we currently do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures. In addition, as of September
	30, 2016, with regards to our professional service agreement that provided 100% of our revenues since inception, we and our client
	have fully satisfied our professional service and payment obligations under the agreement, respectively. We are actively pursuing
	new client relationships. Even if we were to add a new client(s), due to our current lack of a diversified client base, there
	could be temporary imbalances between cash receipts and cash operating expenditures, which means that we may need additional capital.
	The engagement revenues associated with most client engagements will self-fund the in-house and sub-contractor services we need
	in order to supply products and services to our clients.




	 




	As
	of September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $346,888. The Company’s cash flow used in operating
	cash flows was ($478,823) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As discussed in Note 7 of the financial statements, the
	Company has raised $500,000 in the debt financing. In addition, the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while
	it continues to make changes in operations to further improve its cash flow and liquidity position. Based upon subsequent debt
	financing and the Company’s current cash flow projections, management believes the Company will need additional capital
	resources to meet projected cash flow requirements for the next twelve months.

	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our sources and uses of cash were as follows:




	 






	Net
	Cash Used in Operating Activities






	 




	We
	experienced negative cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in the amount of $478,823.
	The net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to cash used to fund a net loss of $717,292 adjusted for non-cash
	expenses of $720 and $268,190 increase accounts payable and accrued related party and by a $39,772 net increase in prepared expenses.




	 







	Net Cash used in Investing Activities






	 




	During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company purchased $5,474 of
	office equipment and opened an investment account with a deposit of $2,000.



	 






	Net

	Net
	cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $599,039 related to $120,000 of proceeds
	from convertible note payable from related parties offset by the repayment of $20,961 of short term advances from related parties.
	In addition, we received $500,000 for a convertible debenture (See Note 7 in the Financial Statements)




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates





	 




	There
	are no material changes from the critical accounting policies set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 10-K which was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. Please refer
	to that document for disclosures regarding the critical accounting policies related to our business.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Standards





	 




	We
	have implemented all new accounting standards that are in effect and may impact our financial statements and do not believe that
	there are any other new accounting standards that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position
	or results of operations.

	we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
	the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
	us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
	Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	(b)
	Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	This
	Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure
	controls. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s
	Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board
	of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
	and includes those policies and procedures that:




	 






	(1)




	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
	the assets of the issuer;






	 




	 






	(2)




	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance
	with authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and






	 




	 






	(3)




	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer’s
	assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 




	Disclosure
	controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is appropriately recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods.




	 




	Management
	has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period
	covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
	by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).




	 




	Based
	on this assessment, management concluded that as of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, it had material
	weaknesses in its internal control procedures.




	 




	As
	of period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
	was ineffective. The Company’s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below:




	 





	Functional
	Controls, Lack of Audit Committee and Segregation of Duties





	 




	Because
	of the Company’s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing.




	 




	The
	Company does not have an audit committee and therefore there is no independent review and independent oversight over the Company’s
	financial reporting.




	 




	There
	is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company’s management is composed of a small
	number of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation,
	we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional
	staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter at end of the fiscal year to determine whether
	improvement in segregation of duty is feasible.




	 




	Accordingly,
	as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable
	possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
	timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.




	 




	Management
	believes that the material weaknesses set forth above were the result of the scale of our operations and are intrinsic to our
	small size. Management believes these weaknesses did not have a material effect on our financial results and intends to take remedial
	actions upon receiving funding for the Company’s business operations.




	 




	This
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting
	firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report herein.




	 





	(c)
	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
	Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
	our internal control over financial reporting.

	PART
	II - OTHER INFORMATION





	 









	Item
	1. Legal Proceedings.





	 




	We
	are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business,
	financial condition or operating results. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings,
	which arise, in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these
	or other matters that may harm our business could arise from time to time.





	 









	Item
	1a. Risk Factors.





	 




	Smaller
	reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.





	 









	Item
	2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.





	 



	On September 30, 2016, the Chief Executive
	Officer of the Company loaned $120,000 to the Company at an interest rate of 10% due on October 1, 2017 (the “Loan”).

	In connection with the Loan, the Company issue 600,000
	warrants at an exercise price of $1.00 which expire on October 1, 2019.




	 




	The
	preceding securities were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), but
	qualified for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The securities were exempt from registration under Section
	4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance of such securities by the Company did not involve a “public offering,”
	as defined in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the transaction, size
	of the offering, and manner of the offering and number of securities offered. The Company did not undertake an offering in which
	it sold a high number of securities to a high number of investors. In addition, the Investor had the necessary investment intent
	as required by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act since they agreed to, and received, the securities bearing a legend stating
	that such securities are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these securities
	would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering.” Based on
	an analysis of the above factors, the Company has met the requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
	Act.







	 









	Item
	3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.





	 




	On
	December 23, 2015 the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $25,000 (the “Note”).
	The Note became due on March 23, 2016 and is now in default. The Note carries a default interest rate of $18%. The Note further
	contains a provision that the lender may convert any part of the Note, including accrued interest that is unpaid into the Company’s
	common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. As of September 30, 2016, the accrued interest on the Note is $2,730.





	 









	Item
	4. Mine Safety Disclosures.





	 




	Not
	applicable.





	 









	Item
	5. Other Information.





	 




	None.

 1. What is an analytical balance?  An analytical or semi analytical balance is a form of scale that measures mass to a high degree of precision. It has a weighing capacity in the range of 100-500 g (typically 200 g) and a readability of 0.1 mg – 0.001 mg. Analytical balance sensitivity requires it to be protected by a draft shield or an enclosure.METTLER TOLEDO XPE, XSE and XS analytical balances are equipped with the SmartGrid weighing pan minimising air turbulence and therefore shorten stabilization times and allowing faster weighing results.
 2. Where are analytical balances used? What are the application areas of analytical balances? An analytical balance scale, often called a "lab balance", permits quantitative analysis of a sample. Typical applications of an electronic analytical balance include: Sample/standard preparation, formulation, differential weighing, density determination, interval weighing and pipette routine testing.
 3. How to weigh on an analytical balance? To start a weighing operation, open the door and place a container on the pan using gloves or tweezers.Close the door and wait until the value stabilises, noting the weight. Clear the display by pressing the tare button until it reads 0.0000 g. Add the sample until the desired weight is reached. Close the door and again wait for stability - record the net weight. If the instrument is unplugged for cleaning, allow readjustment time before reuse.METTLER TOLEDO’s analytical balances are designed for easy cleaning with draft shield disassembly in seconds, and dishwasher-safe panels. Cleaning Recommendations and Regulations for Balances
 4. What are the effects of static electricity on an analytical balance and how to eliminate static charges? Electrostatic charges can cause unstable, non-repeatable weighing results. Static electricity exerts a force on the weighing pan, which directly affects analytical balance results. Precautions to reduce these effects include:Ensure adequate air humidity (≥ 45%...50%)If possible, use antistatic weighing containers (metal is ideal)Avoid rubbing containersIf the sample is small enough, use a metal dish with an edge to help shield the electric fieldsTo ensure analytical balance static elimination, discharge the sample and container with an ionizer before weighing.Read additional information on electrostatic charges and the physics behind it.  
 5. What is analytical balance uncertainty? When making measurements there is always an element of uncertainty. An estimate of doubt that surrounds it (the uncertainty) is key to any measurement. This is determined by measuring the performance of the balance, properties of the weighing object and environmental surroundings. Determination of measurement uncertainty is an integral part of a balance calibration.
 6. Why should I calibrate my analytical balance? Analytical balance calibration ensures that weighing equipment is accurate and satisfies standards such as ISO, GLP/GMP, IFS, and BRC. Documented calibration procedures indicate the quality of measurements, and should be performed regularly throughout the balance’s lifetime.Calibration should not be confused with adjustment of a balance, and must be repeated after adjustment/repairs. Read more on Calibration.
 6. How should I calibrate my analytical balance? The calibration of an analytical balance is performed by an authorized service technician following a standard procedure, using calibration software:Establish how well the instrument performs by testing the relationship between measurement standards and indications through calibration. Verify whether the instrument meets specific requirements with a Pass/Fail statement. If requirements are not met, adjust the instrument so that any deviation does not exceed tolerance limits.Re-calibrate the instrument to confirm compliance with specified tolerances.In between calibration intervals, routine testing by the user can detect potential issues.METTLER TOLEDO has developed a global scientific standard for the secure selection, calibration and operation of weighing equipment, GWP®, or Good Weighing Practice™.
 7. Which tolerances apply to balance calibration? Tolerances determine whether a balance or scale behaves "well enough" to meet a particular set of process requirements. Tolerances set the criteria to issue a Pass/Fail statement. Tolerances come from a variety of sources, including:Legal tolerances:Legal tolerances stipulated by OIML R76 or NIST Handbook 44 (US only) assess legal for trade requirements. These tolerances are quite large and easily met with laboratory balances, or when weighing at the lower end of the measurement range.Manufacturer tolerances:Manufacturer tolerances ensure that equipment meets manufacturer specifications. Manufacturer tolerances do not consider user specific process requirements, and are unsuitable for improving the weighing process.Process tolerances: Specific process tolerances defined by the user, support process improvements and savings on material, waste and rework. For scales in a legal for trade application, process tolerances should therefore be applied in addition to legal tolerances. Legal tolerances protect consumers but do not consider specific producer requirements. Optimising process tolerances that are applied to measuring instruments can have a large impact on process profitability.
 8. What is the analytical balance minimum weight? Every analytical balance minimum weight is different, depending on the performance of the load cell, its location, and ambient conditions. The minimum weight is the accuracy limit of the instrument, below this minimum weight, the relative measurement uncertainty (absolute measurement uncertainty divided by the load, usually indicated in %) is larger than the required weighing accuracy, and the weighing result cannot be trusted.In order to determine the minimum weight for a balance, measurement uncertainty needs to be assessed in the working environment. Alternatively repeatability, as the dominant source of error in the lower balance range, can be assessed to determine the minimum weight, carried out using a small weight, below 5% of balance capacity.The MinWeigh function of METTLER TOLEDO analytical balances, installed by a certified technician, monitors the minimum sample weight of the balance. If a weighing is below the determined acceptable minimum value, the balance display turns red.
 9. Analytical balance accuracy and precision – what is the difference and how to test them? Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other. Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a known value, and is based on readability, repeatability, non-linearity and eccentricity. Accuracy can be tested usingAn external reference weight with a known mass (traceable calibrated weight)Automatic internal adjustment using a reference mass built into the balanceAccuracy can only be determined by testing of the instrument at its location of use.

 1. Microbalance - what are they? A micro balance or ultra-microbalance can deliver the highest precision of all lab balances. This high sensitivity in micro balance design allows for the weighing of sample quantities with weight as low as 30 μg.  Microbalances offer a capacity of up to 10.1 g with readability down to 1 µg (0.000001g). Ultra microbalances offer an incredible full resolution of 61 million digits, with a capacity of 6.1 g and 0.1 µg readability (0.0000001g).Ordinary nameAccuracy classReadability  Number of digits after decimal position (g)Ultra microbalance I0.1 μg0.0000001 g7 digits or decimal placesMicrobalance I1 μg0.000001 g6 digits or decimal placesSemi microbalance I0.01 mg0.00001 g5 digits or decimal placesMETTLER TOLEDO’s portfolio includes a micro-analytical balance. It has a readability like a micro balance, 1 µg, andd the shape of an analytical balance, with an outer and inner weighing chamber.The XPE micro-analytical balances deliver the highest capacity, coupled with the lowest possible minimum weight . This enables dosing of very small amounts directly into a "large" tare containers.
 2. What is special about microbalance design? A micro balance consists of two components - one containing the electronics and the other, the precise mechanical measuring cell. This separation eliminates the effects of temperature and the influence it has on the performance of your micro balance scale.METTLER TOLEDO XPR Micro and Ultra-Microbalances are equipped with an Active Temperature Control system (ATC™). This increases the weighing stability and enables an outstanding level of performance and accuracy.
 3. What is a microbalance used for? Microbalances and ultra microbalances are frequently used in product testing and quality assurance labs, as well as chemistry labs and mining to measure small amounts of powders and minerals. Medical device research might also employ a micro balance to check uniformity in critical components.Micro balance applications include: particulate matter (filter) weighing, pipette calibration, analysis of pesticides, and stent weighing. Ultra micro balance applications include: particulate matter (filter) weighing, ashing or incineration, drying, measurement of coatings, and checking spillage quantities.
 4. Which METTLER TOLEDO microbalance is right for me? To find the appropriate METTLER TOLEDO micro balance for your needs, first define the smallest amount you need to weigh and how accurately you need to weigh it (i.e. acceptable tolerance) to determine the precise micro balance you require.Every measurement on any balance is subject to uncertainty - understanding this uncertainty is key to ensuring accurate results and the avoidance of errors. When weighing small samples on a microbalance, uncertainty is almost entirely due to repeatability (i.e. at the low end of the weighing range of a specific balance). It is not the readability that determines the accuracy of a weighing instrument, but rather its repeatability, or depending on it, its minimum weight capability.Ask your METTLER TOLEDO consultant about GWP® Recommendation which helps you select the right weighing instrument for your own individual requirements. 
 5. What are the challenges and solutions to get stable measurements on a microbalance? A micro balance is an extremely sensitive instrument – the slightest disturbance caused by environmental influences or user interaction can significantly affect measurement stability. All possible sources of vibrations should be avoided when using a micro balance. Microbalances are highly susceptible to air currents, dust, and fluctuations in temperature, and should only be used where ambient temperature and humidity are maintained at a stable level – away from vents, windows, and doors.Ideally the balance should be set-up on a solid workbench - preferably a dedicated weighing table that can remain optimised for micro balance use, free from draughts or high traffic.When a micro balance is first connected to the power supply or switched on, a minimum warm-up time of 6 hours is recommended for ambient temperature adjustment.When using the micro balance, be sure to minimize convection flows inside the weighing chamber, which can negatively impact results. Only handle samples with tweezers, and allow acclimatisation to room temperature. When placing the sample onto the micro balance, the door should be opened to a minimum degree, for as short a time as possible.Follow METTLER TOLEDO’s dedicated guide to weighing, 10 Steps to Successful Micro-Weighingand get further tips on how to deal with challenges when weighing with microbalances, including determining proper balance location and calibration.
 6. How to weigh on a microbalance? Always wear gloves while working with microbalances – fingerprints and oil from hands affect results. To start a weighing operation, open the door and place a container on the pan using tweezers. Close the door and allow the value to stabilize. Tare the micro balance. To avoid spills in the balance remove the container or weighing boat, dose the sample outside the weighing chamber, and place the sample on the weighing pan. Close the door and wait for stability. Record the net weight or repeat the procedure until desired weight is reached. A micro balance is highly sensitive to movement - do not touch the bench while waiting for the balance to stabilize. Clean the balance, tools and workspace after each use.The draft shield of METTLER TOLEDO’s XPR micro balance provides easy 360° access to the weighing pan and all-round visibility. There are no edges or corners where sample material could become trapped, and all parts can be removed, cleaned, and replaced in a few simple steps.
 7. How to perform calibration, adjustment and routine tests of a microbalance? The accuracy of a weighing device is determined by correct micro balance calibration - performed by a qualified service provider only. The calibration certificate proves a micro balance is working correctly, user routine balance testing detects potential issues in performance within a calibration interval.Automated adjustment functions with internal test weights, such as FACT or proFACT, ensure that the balance maintains accuracy, even during fluctuations in ambient temperature.METTLER TOLEDO has developed a globally applicable scientific standard for the secure selection, calibration, and operation of weighing equipment, known as GWP®, or Good Weighing Practice™, and Balance and Scale Calibration and Adjustment – Clarification of Terms

Mass Comparators Comparators from 0.1 µg to 6000 kgHow can we assist you?►Expertise Library ►Product Finder ►Service Finder 
 Request Info  Get a Quote  Mass Comparators from METTLER TOLEDO Continuous Innovation - Accompanying Your Future1. What is the definition of a comparator?A mass comparator or comparator balance is a balance with best possible resolution and repeatability allowing determining even the smallest difference is mass. While window-range mass comparators are purely used for mass calibration and mass determination, full-range mass comparators are versatile and can be used for weight determination but as well for general weighing applications where small samples meet large tare loads or the large and small amounts need to be combined in one weighing process. Contact your local METTLER TOLEDO representative to receive a GWP Recommendation identifying the models suiting your personal needs.2.  What makes mass calibration so different?In a regular weighing process, the balanced is calibrated and the individual weighing are against zero g, therefore the process is called "absolute weighing". With weight calibration, which is a specific type of differential weighing, the reference point is not the calibrated comparator balance; it's the reference weight against which the test weight is compared to. Reference weight need to be at least one weight class higher than the test weight. Each of the reference weights is again calibrated against another weight of higher class resulting to a traceability to the national prototype and finally to the International Prototype of the kilogram at the BIPM in Paris, France.3. What applications are comparators used for?The primary applications where mass comparators are used for is mass calibration. For lower class weights, in particular M 1-3, F1 & 2 classes, manual mass comparators provide results of sufficient accuracy. For weights of E1 or E2 class it is recommended to use either robotic or automated mass comparators as the measurement uncertainty is significantly lower, this mainly due to the obsolescence of the operators influence. In national metrology institutes (NMI's), which strive continuously for measurements with smallest uncertainty, vacuum or constant pressure mass comparators are utilized as these allow performing measurements at constant conditions. Influences such as geographic altitude, air buoyancy or weather conditions can be eliminated. National metrology institutes and metrology research center apply mass comparators for scientific research to measure smallest changes in mass or force.Besides the metrology application mass comparator are as well in use in other industries where the performance of a regular balance cannot meet the customer demand. For these applications the comparators are referred to as higher performance balances.Some of these industrial applications are:Formulation – if tolerance levels are low and the save weighing range of the balance does not fulfil the instrument demandsDifferential weighing applications – if the difference in mass is very small and an ordinary balance cannot provide trustworthy resultsGas filling – Heavy gas bottles are filled with a small amount of precious reference gasScuffing – Gears are analyzed on abrasion after the engine was run for a specified time in the lubricant of investigationForce measurements – Measurements where an applied force is compensated by the weighing cell 4. What is the difference between a mass comparator and a balance?Mass Comparators are of identical design and principle as an electronic balance. What differentiates the balance to the comparator is the performance, in particular the readability and repeatability.Precision Balance with 1 kg capacity and 1 mg readabilityManual mass comparator / Higher performance balance with 1 kg capacity and 0.1 mg readabilityWindow-range mass comparator 1 kg capacity and 0.01 mg readabilityAutomated mass comparator 1 kg capacity and 0.001 mg readabilityConstant/ Vacuum mass comparators 1 kg capacity and 0.0001 mg readabilityRegular laboratory balances are specified by the main properties repeatability (RP), eccentricity (EC), nonlinearity (NL) and sensitivity (SE). As weight calibration is subject of differential weighing mass comparators are additionally specified with differential weighing repeatability ABA (RP ABA). 5. How to calibrate a mass comparator?According to regulations, Mass Comparators in use for mass calibration do not need to be calibrated, as the reference weight is calibrated and ensures for traceability to the BIPM and the definition of the kilogram. To protect your investment and ensure continuous constant measurement performance, METTLER TOELDO recommends performing preventive maintenance on a routine base.Where mass comparators are in use in applications different than weight calibration, it is crucial to apply existing quality standards on the XPR-C balances, identical to other analytical or precision balances.  OverviewServicesPublicationsMC LinkMore InformationOverviewServicesPublicationsMC LinkMore Information
