Our Story  




  Our Story 



ShareSafe was created from a passion to make a difference and to establish a new standard in healthcare security, communication and education. Our genesis was inspired by Dr. Peter Pronovost, Senior Vice President of Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins University, who is one of the leading authorities on patient safety.  Dr. Pronovost has dedicated his career to establishing scientific methods and educating others in the prevention of medical errors.  Through his efforts, thousands of lives have been saved in hospitals throughout the world. ShareSafe’s technology was originally created as a secure delivery platform to assist in accelerating and scaling best practices and evidence-based medicine (EBM) like Dr. Pronovost’s, as well as improving patient safety and collaboration across the healthcare landscape.
