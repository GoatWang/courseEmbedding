Investor RelationsLannett Company develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a broad spectrum of off-patent pharmaceutical products in a variety of dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, extended release, topicals, oral solutions and parenterals. Additionally, the company has an established Specialty Pharma division for the marketing of its first brand drug, C-Topical, and, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cody Laboratories, develops and manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
The company is committed to product development and has built a deep pipeline that includes a substantial number of product applications pending at the FDA in addition to a large number of product candidates in various stages of development.  Lannett has grown substantially, with a top line compounded annual growth rate of more than 25% since 2001.  The company intends to grow its business organically, as well as by acquiring complementary products or companies and forming strategic relationships.
Lannett has targeted three areas of its business for expansion. The strategy for its base generics business is to commercialize products in its pipeline, develop products with market barriers to entry, acquire complementary products and form strategic relationships. For its controlled substance business, the company intends to continue to invest in the development of higher margin products, with a focus on novel forms of delivery, to become a dominant player in the U.S. Lastly, the company will continue to ramp up its branded products business.
Each of Lannett’s business areas are primed for growth. The company anticipates that the demand for its generic medications, narcotics and controlled drugs, and branded products will fueled by, among other things, the aging Baby Boomer population. Lannett’s strong track record of regulatory compliance and manufacturing excellence, combined with strong management team, position the company well for the future.

Lannett Co.: A Pharmaceutical Empire In The Making - Lannett Company, Inc (NYSEMKT:LCI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Lannett Co.: A Pharmaceutical Empire In The MakingSep.22.15 | About: Lannett Company, (LCI) James Melvin Long only, growth at reasonable price, long-term horizon, mid-capSummaryKremers' acquisition more than doubles Lannett’s sales and gives material revenue diversification.Lannett now has 64 drugs in development and 39 pending approval, thus giving a huge runway for growth.Shareholders significantly underestimate Lannett’s earnings power going from negative leverage to holding moderate leverage.Lannett has a proven management with a massive stake in the company, giving a high level of alignment with shareholders.Conservative valuation points to a 35% discount to its peer group.Background info
Lannett Company Inc. (NYSEMKT:LCI) develops, manufactures, packages, markets, and distributes generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products in the United States. It offers solid oral, extended release, topical, nasal, and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs that address a range of therapeutic areas, as well as ophthalmic, patch, foam, buccal, sublingual, soft gel, and injectable dosages. The company provides its products for various medical indications comprising of glaucoma, muscle relaxant, migraine, anesthetic, congestive heart failure, thyroid deficiency, dryness of the mouth, gout, bronchospasms, hypertension, and gallstone. It also manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients. Product Diversification
The KU acquisition adds 18 high-margin products to the current portfolio, making the total marketed product count over 100. Six of the products coming from the acquisition have sales north of $20 million annually with strong market positioning. The largest contributor to Kremers' sales is Methylphenidate XR, an established, high-value product with limited competition and considerable upside. Kremers is one of only 3 companies in this space (Teva (NYSE:TEVA) and Mallinckrodt (NYSE:MNK)), thereby increasing the likelihood of keeping pricing consistent or even being able to increase their pricing.
This drug is prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and narcolepsy. The drug is more popularly known as Concerta. I believe the addressable market for Concerta will continue to grow as more and more youth are being prescribed ADD and ADHD medicine as a way to control hyperactive behavior. The Kremers product portfolio most importantly diversifies Lannett's heavy reliance on the thyroid deficiency and gallstone categories for over 50% of revenues by category. Previously, these two categories accounted for 54% of sales and now account for only 29% of sales, thereby creating a much more balanced categorical revenue stream.


Scale and Industry
The combined company has pro forma sales of $820M versus $407M in sales for LCI as a stand-alone company, thereby increasing revenues by a staggering 101.5%. This is especially important as it makes it the largest generic company in the sub-$10 billion market cap. Teva and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) are the clear market leaders in the generics field by size, but this acquisition will put the combined company as the largest, excluding these behemoth companies. This will be vastly important as increased scale will decrease costs of production and industry consolidation should drive higher prices with less competition.
Major blockbuster drugs are increasingly coming off patent, with an estimated $230 billion worth of branded drugs coming off patent from 2013 and 2018. The massive size of branded drugs coming off patent is increasingly important for the major players such as the combined Lannett Company as it has the R&D expertise, scale, resources, and flexibility to choose its niche to further diversify sales in major categories. These drugs add a significant growth opportunities for the best positioned generic companies and I believe Lannett is the best in class of the smaller companies.

Drug Pipeline
The acquisition of Silarix and Kremers adds significant marketed products that are currently being sold, a strong pipeline in development, as well as drugs currently pending approval. Management has been extremely efficient in obtaining approval for drugs and thus diversifying the company's revenue stream. Lannett has 64 products in development after the approval at Kremers. This is a very strong pipeline for any generic company and even more impressive given its relatively small size compared with industry leaders such as Teva and Mylan. The more exciting part of this acquisition is that Lannett currently has 39 drugs pending approval. Management has no effective way to include drugs that will be approved or will be rejected, therefore, they are completely left out of any guidance. This is especially important, as estimates are continually conservative thus making Wall Street punish Lannett in the near term even as it continually beats estimates. This is validated by its 14 consecutive quarters where sales and adjusted earnings per share exceeded the comparable prior year period, pointing to the stability in its business model.

Lannett still trades at a significant discount to peers, even though it has displayed incredible consistency in its top and bottom line numbers. Lannett was recently recognized by Fortune magazine as the fastest growing company in the United States. It received this award before it made the transformational acquisition of Kremers generic unit. I believe the 103 drugs in development and pending approval in addition to the $230 billion in branded drugs coming off patent from 2013 to 2018 will give a huge runway for growth.

R&D and Manufacturing capacity
The acquisition of Silarix and Kremers offers significant manufacturing and R&D capacity. Silarix has a 111,000 square foot manufacturing and warehouse capacity that is fully staffed and has been in business for 28 years with no regulatory problems. The Kremers facility is a fully inspected 381,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility in Seymour, Indiana. These facilities offer substantial manufacturing, warehouse, and product development capacity that is integral to avoid production bottlenecks with a company growing as fast as Lannett. Management stated that they were considering investing in a fully outfitted R&D center that would cost an estimated $180 million and could take as long as 10 years to gain full FDA approval. These acquisitions also show strong strategic purpose for Lannett as it vies for market share in a quickly growing generic industry.
Capital Structure
Lannett previously operated with no debt, $213.8 million in cash, and $150 million credit revolver. The Kremers acquisition will leave the company with $225 million in liquidity (cash and credit facility). Lannett will operate with $1.16 billion in debt, which I believe is very reasonable given $348 million in EBIT. Lannett has strong cash flow making the debt load very manageable. I am very glad to hear management's intention to quickly decrease leverage for the company, as I do not like to own companies that pay out a significant portion of earnings in interest payments. The $225 million in liquidity gives management significant ability to make core business investments as well as any additional strategic acquisitions.

I like the fact that management is keeping adequate liquidity, but I also want to see integration of the businesses before any significant acquisitions are made. Lannett's shift from negative leverage to obtaining a reasonable amount of leverage will significantly bolster operational results. I believe that this is still massively underestimated by the investing community as a whole and will aid in beating future estimates on both the top and bottom line.
Large Insider Ownership
Insider ownership is a topic often discussed across Seeking Alpha and the larger investment community. I believe this is a massively underestimated factor that retail and institutional investors miss alike. The obvious factor in high insider ownership is that shareholder and management interests are more highly aligned as they have a larger stake in the performance of the stock price. The more important factor is that management will make decisions that create long-term value creation rather than making shortsighted decisions. Smart long-term strategic decisions are of special interest to investors who have a long horizon on holding stock such as I do.
The top 4 insider owners in Lannett own 14,062,086 shares of the company with a market value of $803,507,594.04 based on market price per share of $57.14. The top 4 insider owners control 38.6% of the shares outstanding, which is an extremely high figure for a company with a $2 billion market cap and points to their confidence in the company. Companies with a relatively small float due to high insider ownership are a favorite of mine as the small float discourages large institutional investors from having significant coverage on the stock. This enables retail investors who do thorough due diligence to have a significant information advantage over the average shareholder.


Valuation

My valuation method uses EV/EBIT as EBIT was the best measure of profitability given by Lannett in its company presentation on the Kremers acquisition. Looking at Lannett's peers, the range of EV/EBIT was in the range of 12-15x, thus I used the low end of the range to maintain conservatism. Lannett trades at a 35% discount to its peers based on an EV/EBIT measure using a conservative multiple. I believe this estimate is highly conservative based on Lannett's management stating that they expect $40 million in operating synergies after the third year of operation, which should all fall to the bottom line. Management also stated that they expect a $100 million tax benefit due to the acquisition on top of it being accretive to earnings by 20-25% in 2017.
Lannett trades at a much lower price-to-earnings ratio of 14.50 than its peers such as Akorn Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRX) (116.62) and Impax Laboratories (NASDAQ:IPXL) (411.32), which does not include the earnings from the recent acquisition. The market leaders such as Mylan trades at a P/E of 24 and Teva trades at 21.4 times earnings, despite having lower growth rates than Lannett. I refrained from using a P/E valuation method as Impax and Akorn skew the mean of the group with their astronomically higher valuation. These figures serve as a demonstration to show how most similar competitors are valued, even though they are not perfect comparisons.
Risks
Increasing cost of generics - Generics are suppose to be significantly discounted to the original patented version of the drug, but prices have increased significantly over the past few years. This has put the pharmaceutical industry as a whole under closer scrutiny as health care is increasingly becoming unaffordable. If there is a serious crack down on prices, Lannett could suffer material pricing issues, thus leading to lower sales and profitability. I believe a major policy shift in pricing is largely mitigated by its extensive pipeline and the low precedence for significantly limiting the pricing power of the pharmaceutical industry.

Debt load - Lannett currently has a significant amount of debt on its books. The $1.06 billion term loan will have a meaningful interest payment, thus reducing its profitability in the near term. Management stated their intention to pay this down as quickly as possible unless a new strategic acquisition arises in which they may take on additional debt if necessary. Lannett's high-margin business creates a high level of cash flow, thus enabling it to manage this debt thus reducing the threat of the leverage deteriorating all profitability. The profitability of the combined companies should enable Lannett to pay down the debt swiftly, thus largely mitigating this risk.
Reliance on JSP - The contracted production of Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals contributes to a significant portion of sales. The contacted production agreement was extended for 5 years until 2019, thus reducing the likelihood of this relationship ending. The revenue diversification from the Kremers acquisition also helps reduce Lannett's reliance on the production of JSP's drugs. Any material change to the two companies' relationship could impact Lannett's fundamentals.
Litigation - The company has a class action lawsuit brought against it by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This suit was voluntarily dropped, but any additional litigation could seriously impact the company's results.
Conclusion
The broader market has vastly underestimated Lannett, even though it was named the fastest growing company by Fortune last year. The Kremers acquisition has meaningfully changed the capital structure from negative leverage to moderate leverage, which will magnify strong top and bottom line growth. The 103 drugs in development and pending approval create a massive runway for growth and enable Lannett to significantly diversify its revenue. I believe Lannett has been assigned a lower multiple due to its previous reliance on Digoxin and Levothyroxine Sodium, but the market has yet to give Lannett credit for the revenue diversification from the Kremers acquisition and the inevitable diversification from its massive pipeline.

Management has been extremely cautious with estimates and this has caused investors to push the stock down far below fundamental value. My estimate points to a 35% discount to its peers despite showing stronger growth and multiple market opportunities. A small market cap and a small float due to high insider ownership discourages many analysts from covering the company, thus creating what I believe to be a mispriced security. I believe Lannett offers a strong opportunity to earn significant alpha with limited downside risk at the current market price.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
