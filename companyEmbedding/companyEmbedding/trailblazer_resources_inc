Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.

Trailblazer Resources, Inc. Enters into Agreement to Acquire the Operating and Intellectual Property Assets of Solus Industries, LLC. | Business Wire


























































Trailblazer Resources, Inc. Enters into Agreement to Acquire the 
      Operating and Intellectual Property Assets of Solus Industries, LLC.






September 17, 2013 09:14 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Trailblazer Resources, Inc. (OTCQB:TBLZ) announced today that the 
      agreement it had entered into on September 9, 2013 to acquire the assets 
      of Solus Industries, LLC, a Minnesota Limited Liability Company 
      (“Solus”) had been approved by Solus’ members and thus is now effective. 
      Under the terms of the agreement, Trailblazer Resources, Inc. 
      (‘Trailblazer”) will purchase the assets of Solus, including all 
      intellectual property assets known as Solus Intel. Trailblazer would not 
      assume any of Solus’ liabilities under the agreement, including any 
      responsibility for any future litigation.
    

      Under the September 9th agreement, Trailblazer would issue to Solus a 
      total of 20,000,000 shares of newly-issued common stock, representing 
      41.4% of Trailblazer’s then-outstanding shares. These shares will not 
      have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Solus management 
      and founding shareholders would have an additional restriction that 
      prohibits registration of the shares until the resulting company is both 
      a fully reporting company listed on the NASDAQ Capital Markets exchange 
      and is EBITDA-positive. The agreement anticipates that Trailblazer will 
      change its name to Solus Corporation at or shortly after the closing of 
      the asset acquisition transaction.
    

      The agreement further caps management compensation and sales commissions 
      at existing levels until Solus Corporation achieves positive cash flow.
    

      Trailblazer has entered into this asset acquisition based on Solus’ 
      representations that it is a privately-held company organized under the 
      laws of the State of Minnesota with a ten-year operating history, and 
      that it has developed and deployed a proven business model that 
      leverages Solus’ proprietary 35-million datapoint database of system 
      performance intelligence on commercial roofing, 
      heating/ventilation/air-conditioning (“HVAC”) and refrigeration systems 
      to deliver to commercial customers a guaranteed minimum 10% reduction in 
      facilities maintenance spend relative to these systems.
    

      Solus represents that its business model represents a virtual roll-up of 
      the facilities maintenance industry, with service providers across the 
      country joining the Solus network (following certification) and paying 
      substantial recurring subscription fees for access to SOLUS’ growing 
      intelligence database, proprietary analytic models and facilities 
      maintenance programs. SOLUS represents that its model is designed to 
      reduce customer risk associated with poor system repair diagnostics and 
      logistical inefficiencies, allowing Solus to pre-identify the optimal 
      solution and deliver to the customer’s site the right service provider 
      with the right parts and the right know-how in a timely fashion. SOLUS 
      further represents that it can exercise real-time oversight of the work 
      of Solus’ services providers and share that oversight with full 
      transparency to the customer.
    

      Solus represents that its business model provides a significant 
      Software-As-A-Service (“SaaS”) -like character to the SOLUS’ financial 
      performance, enhancing its desirability to TBLZ shareholders.
    

      Solus further represents that it has held operational contracts with a 
      number of customers, including Albertson’s, Home Depot, Target Stores 
      and FedEx, among others, and that it has operational contracts as well 
      as contingent and potential contracts and relationships sufficient to 
      fund current annual operating expenses. Solus also represents that Solus 
      requires additional capital in order to deliver full value to its 
      members as well as recruit and retain public-company management 
      expertise.
    

      Trailblazer has agreed to provide, by September 19, 2013, $190,000 of 
      preliminary bridge capital to SOLUS, and advance to Axis Solutions, LLC 
      additional funding to start the development of the next generation of 
      the Solus Intel platform. Trailblazer is to provide a second tranche of 
      $250,000 of bridge capital within ten days following the closing of the 
      asset acquisition. The first $190,000 bridge loan will be secured by the 
      intellectual property owned by SOLUS.
    

      The agreement is also contingent on the satisfactory completion of due 
      diligence by Trailblazer. The agreement provides for completion of due 
      diligence by September 27, 2013 and closing of the asset acquisition on 
      or before November 15, 2013.
    

      Sam Fairchild, Trailblazer’s CEO noted that “our preliminary due 
      diligence indicates that Solus’ business model may be unique, and that 
      Solus’ eight-year head start in developing the database necessary to 
      drive the model forward may provide substantial competitive advantages. 
      We look forward to completing our due diligence and, if favorable, 
      moving Solus’ Facilities Intel business forward in order to build 
      shareholder value.”
    

      Trailblazer Resources is a Nevada Corporation with no current business 
      operations. Trailblazer is seeking a private company as a possible 
      reverse acquisition target in order to generate value for the Company’s 
      shareholders. For information please contact Sam Fairchild at: 
      800-815-8069.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
