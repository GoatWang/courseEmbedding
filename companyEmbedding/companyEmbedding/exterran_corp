Diversification Key To Exterran Holdings - Exterran Corporation (NYSE:EXTN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Diversification Key To Exterran HoldingsFeb.26.16 | About: Exterran Corporation (EXTN) Kevin George Long/short equity, currencies, commoditiesSummaryExterran releases fourth quarter earnings.
        Diversified products and global reach are positives.
        Financial position is strong.
          Exterran releases fourth quarter earnings Exterran Corp (NYSE:EXTN) released fourth quarter earnings on Thursday showing a net loss of $12 million for the Houston-based company. Created from a spin-off of Archrock Inc (NYSE:AROC) in November 2015, Exterran currently has a market cap of $458 million, with the recent quarter still affected by costs associated with that breakup. Despite the loss for the quarter, the company still saw full year revenues for 2015 of $1.9 billion, which were 14% lower than 2014, however the company sells products to the oil & gas industry so there was always going to be negatives in this report. Chief Executive, Andrew Way commented on the results saying, "Though market conditions continue to be very challenging as a result of low commodity prices and industry activity levels, we performed generally in line with our expectations during the fourth quarter. In our service businesses, gross margin was relatively stable and benefited from greater focus on operating efficiencies." Way continued, "Capital projects continue to be delayed or cancelled and pricing pressures have intensified as customers navigate an uncertain near-term outlook. In this environment, we will continue to focus on what we can control, including resetting our cost structure in line with changing demand and generating free cash flow through efficient execution and working capital reductions. My expectation is that we will emerge from this downturn with a strong balance sheet and a lean cost structure, which will enable us to take advantage of our business' operating leverage as growth returns." Diversified products and global reach are positives The comments from the CEO tell the real story for Exterran amidst the earnings report. This is a new company, created through a spin-off, which is undergoing price pressures from an industry in crisis, yet is positioning itself well for an improvement in conditions. Two positives for Exterran Corp are the company's diversified product offerings and its global reach. Exterran is a market leader in compression, production and processing products and services so despite being caught in the crossfire of the oil price slump there is scope to be creative with their strategy to position themselves towards areas of growth. Exterran has a base on the waterfront of Singapore with the capability to build topside modules for FPSOs and a range of subsea products, whilst through its company, Belleli Energy CPE, Exterran has the largest facility in Europe for the manufacture of critical process equipment. With 7,000 staff in 30 countries there is a geographic ability to react to demand for its full range of oil, gas and water engineering and project management services. Financial position is strong The real strength for Exterran Inc is its strong financial position. With a market cap of $458 million, the full year EPS of 1.35 per share gives a P/E ratio around 9.6. Margins in 2015 were 63% for contracts, 29% in aftermarket services and 12% in product sales; for a total margin of 26% with the company able to reduce its cost of sales across its three product segments. Capital expenditures were relatively flat year-on-year at $152 million against $1.87 billion in revenues, whilst long-term debt was half of shareholders equity. With the spin-off completed late last year, Exterran will likely have more freedom to pursue its own goals and this could lead to further efficiencies across 2016 and I like the recent comments from the CEO. 

 The real weight on the stock price of Exterran is still the struggles of its customers and the current industry climate of sharp reductions in capital expenditures is not great for the future price of the stock. Despite this, there are still reasons to see future growth for the company and if we see lower prices in the near future there is a real case for value based on spin-off freedom for the strategy and the company's ability to chase multiple markets in global locations. The recent quarter's loss of $12 million should be placed alongside the $32 million in restructuring costs for the year and full year revenues, which were only down 14% in a tough year for oil & gas. A drop in price following the recent earnings is an opportunity to get involved although I may hold off and see if we can get $10, which would create very favourable ratios to capitalize on future growth.

Exterran Corporation Appoints Roger George as Senior Vice President, 
      Global Engineering and Product Lines






December 08, 2016 05:30 PM Eastern Standard Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exterran Corporation (NYSE: EXTN) (“Exterran” or the “Company”) today 
      announced the appointment of Roger George as Senior Vice President, 
      Global Engineering and Product Lines, effective December 15, 2016. 
      George will succeed Steven Muck, who has elected to retire after a 
      41-year career with Exterran and its predecessor companies.
    


      Roger George has a track record of driving growth, innovation and 
      increasing profitability. He has held leadership positions in the oil 
      and gas and power generation sectors for GE, where most recently he was 
      Product Line Leader of their 50Hz utility gas turbine business in 
      Atlanta. Prior to that he was General Manager of GE’s Global Sales and 
      Commercial Operations for distributed power. His other positions with GE 
      include head of Global Compression Sales (distributed power) and General 
      Manager of GE Jenbacher Gas Engines for North America. Earlier in his 
      career he worked for Optimal CAE, Inc. and the Ford Motor Company. 
      George holds an MBA from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. in 
      Mechanical Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla.
    

      Andrew J. Way, Exterran’s President and Chief Executive Officer, 
      commented: “Roger brings a wealth of business and technical experience 
      to Exterran. His deep technical knowledge and results-driven approach 
      will be great assets as we invest and strengthen our portfolio offering, 
      sharpen our strategy and grow our global business.”
    

      Way added, “Steve Muck has played many key roles in the Exterran story 
      and has been a great partner to me since I joined the Company. We will 
      surely miss his presence and strong guiding influence. We wish Steve the 
      very best in his well-deserved retirement.”
    

      George said, “I’m impressed by the high caliber talent Exterran has been 
      attracting and am eager to join the team. The Company’s global 
      footprint, well-known brand, and its reputation as a technical leader 
      create a strong platform and potential for growth. I look forward to 
      helping the Company fulfill its potential.”

Forward-Looking Statements


      All statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the 
      subjects of this release) other than historical facts are 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking 
      statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and 
      are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are 
      outside Exterran’s control, which could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, 
      but is not limited to, the anticipated timing for regaining compliance 
      with all SEC filing requirements and NYSE listing requirements.
    

      While Exterran believes that the assumptions concerning future events 
      are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in 
      predicting certain important factors that could impact the future 
      performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could 
      cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are the following: local, regional, national 
      and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on 
      Exterran and its customers; Exterran’s reduced profit margins or loss of 
      market share resulting from competition or the introduction of competing 
      technologies by other companies; Exterran Corporation’s reliance on 
      Archrock and Archrock Partners, L.P. (named Exterran Partners, L.P. 
      prior to November 3, 2015) for a significant amount of its product sales 
      revenues and its ability to secure new product sales customers; 
      conditions in the oil and gas industry, including a sustained decrease 
      in the level of supply or demand for oil or natural gas or a sustained 
      decrease in the price of oil or natural gas; Exterran’s ability to 
      timely and cost-effectively execute larger projects; changes in 
      political or economic conditions in key operating markets, including 
      international markets; changes in current exchange rates, including the 
      risk of currency devaluations by foreign governments, and restrictions 
      on currency repatriation; the inherent risks associated with Exterran’s 
      operations, such as equipment defects, malfunctions and natural 
      disasters; any non-performance by third parties of their contractual 
      obligations; and changes in safety, health, environmental and other 
      regulations; unanticipated delays in completing the Audit Committee’s 
      internal investigation, the preparation and audit of the Company’s 
      previously filed financial statements and the implementation of changes 
      to the Company’s internal controls and procedures.
    

      These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, 
      forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in 
      Exterran’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
      2015, Exterran’s Registration Statement on Form 10 and Exterran’s other 
      filings with the SEC, which are available at www.exterran.com. 
      Except as required by law, Exterran expressly disclaims any intention or 
      obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether 
      as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

                        Our History

George will succeed Steven Muck, who has elected to retire after a 41-year career with Exterran and its predecessor companies.Roger George has a track record of driving growth, innovation and increasing profitability. He has held leadership positions in the oil and gas and power generation sectors for GE, where most recently he was Product Line Leader of their 50Hz utility gas turbine business in Atlanta.

His other positions with GE include head of Global Compression Sales (distributed power) and General Manager of GE Jenbacher Gas Engines for North America.

We wish Steve the very best in his well-deserved retirement.”George said, “I’m impressed by the high caliber talent Exterran has been attracting and am eager to join the team.

These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside Exterran’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, the anticipated timing for regaining compliance with all SEC filing requirements and NYSE listing requirements.While Exterran believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are the following: local, regional, national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on Exterran and its customers; Exterran’s reduced profit margins or loss of market share resulting from competition or the introduction of competing technologies by other companies; Exterran Corporation’s reliance on Archrock and Archrock Partners, L.P. (named Exterran Partners, L.P. prior to November 3, 2015) for a significant amount of its product sales revenues and its ability to secure new product sales customers; conditions in the oil and gas industry, including a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for oil or natural gas or a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas; Exterran’s ability to timely and cost-effectively execute larger projects; changes in political or economic conditions in key operating markets, including international markets; changes in current exchange rates, including the risk of currency devaluations by foreign governments, and restrictions on currency repatriation; the inherent risks associated with Exterran’s operations, such as equipment defects, malfunctions and natural disasters; any non-performance by third parties of their contractual obligations; and changes in safety, health, environmental and other regulations; unanticipated delays in completing the Audit Committee’s internal investigation, the preparation and audit of the Company’s previously filed financial statements and the implementation of changes to the Company’s internal controls and procedures.Read MoreThese forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in Exterran’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Exterran’s Registration Statement on Form 10 and Exterran’s other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.exterran.com.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018                                                   Exterran Corporation (Exterran) - BNamericas                                                         About us   Contact    Store    Advertising   Customized Research    BNamericas Wire   Help   Language:   EN    English  Spanish      Start a Free Trial                   News Projects Companies Reports Data                        Close  Recovery Password    Email for your account           Send password                 ×   This information is available only to subscribers.
