Series Trust Services




The Investment Managers Series Trusts provide a simple, cost-efficient means of starting and operating a mutual fund - ideal for advisors who wish to offer a mutual fund to enhance their product line.
UMB Fund Services and Mutual Fund Administration, LLC (MFAC) co-sponsor two series trusts. The Investment Managers Series Trust II was established in 2013 due to the success of the original trust and is currently open to new advisors.
The Investment Managers Series Trusts combine UMB’s experience as a fund service provider with the specialized expertise of MFAC in fund formation and series trust administration.
UMB acts as lead service provider, serving as fund accountant, transfer agent and custodian* as well as co-administrator with MFAC.
MFAC takes the lead on general fund oversight, post-trade compliance, handling board and Chief Compliance Officer matters/communication, corporate secretarial services, regulatory compliance, Securities and Exchange Commission registration/reporting, and budgeting.






Benefits and Highlights

A cost-effective means to manage smaller funds – minimal initial capital required
Lower overhead due to sharing a board of trustees, fund officers, a CCO, etc.
Shorter start-up time (roughly half the time needed to start an independent fund)
Lower fund break-even points than an independent fund
Board of trustees, fund auditors, legal counsel and other service providers are already in place
A vehicle for multiple types of accounts – retirement accounts, 401(k)s, etc.
Each fund maintains its own branding/identity
Allows advisors to focus their efforts on managing money and growing assets


Key Services

Fund administration
Fund accounting
Transfer agency and investor services
Custody*
Distribution services**



A multiple series trust (or umbrella trust) is an open-end mutual fund authorized to create an unlimited number of series – or separate portfolios – within the trust. Portfolios in the trust enjoy a variety of benefits compared to stand-alone mutual funds, as summarized above.
*Custody services provided by UMB Bank, n.a.
**Distribution services provided by IMST Distributors, LLC (owned and operated by Foreside)

Multiple Series Trusts


























Multiple Series Trusts
Reduce your funds launch time and lower start-up costs by utilizing our Multiple Series Trust comprehensive service solution and expertise.
We have the qualified professionals and complete service solution necessary to manage a Multiple Series Trust (MST). Advisers with limited assets under management, such as start-ups, often utilize adding a fund to an existing MST. However, these types of funds are becoming viable options for large managers launching mutual funds. Our MSTs allow advisers to capitalize on the strength of their investment strategies and stay focused on raising and managing assets.
Our turn-key solution reduces the legal work necessary by adding your fund to an existing trust, essentially lowering the costs compared to establishing an entirely new fund. Additionally, all MSTs at U.S. Bancorp Fund Services include a dedicated and qualified CCO who acts as a daily resource to the advisers’ CCOs and provides assessment, guidance, and consulting, further reducing your costs and time to market. By leveraging our team of experts, you can avoid the operational and regulatory complexities of starting a traditional mutual fund and continue to focus on growing your fund. Our goal is to ensure you are provided an operational structure with customized services, financial reporting, and complete support and industry guidance.








Multiple Series Trusts offer several advantages, including

Reduced time to market
Lower start-up costs due to the reduced amount of legal review
Governance and service expertise of an existing board
A dedicated CCO for all funds within the trust
Sarbanes-Oxley monitoring and certification for all fund financial reporting
Administrative efficiencies

SEI Expands Advisors' Inner Circle Trust Solution To Provide Turnkey Fund Structure Focused On Alternative Strategies



Rise of Liquid Alternatives Spawns Series Trust Solution for Managers of Private Funds Seeking Efficient Market Entry��
OAKS, Pa., March 12, 2014 � As demand for alternative strategies packaged as retail mutual funds continues to grow, SEI (NASDAQ:SEIC) has launched The Advisors� Inner Circle Fund® (AIC) III with an eye towards helping managers of private funds enter the retail space.� SEI�s Investment Manager Services division is a global supplier of customized operating infrastructure and services to investment organizations representing more than $13 trillion in assets under management. 
AIC III is the third series trust�in the AIC platform that SEI first introduced over 20 years ago and was developed to provide managers with a comprehensive turnkey solution for the operations of retail mutual funds.� This solution included an independent board of trustees, compliance program, fund administration, accounting, investor servicing, and distribution services.� AIC III combines the size of SEI�s series trust platform and SEI�s strong background in alternative services with a new fund board experienced in the alternative investment market.� The new series trust accommodates sophisticated alternative strategies for U.S. and non-U.S. managers who want to enter the U.S. market.� 
        �
        �While many managers of private funds want to take advantage of the burgeoning opportunities in liquid alternatives, they are not always equipped to deal with the intricacies of mutual fund governance, distribution, and regulation,� said John Alshefski, Senior Vice President of SEI�s Investment Manager Services division. �Our Advisors� Inner Circle series trust lets managers of private funds jump into the regulated fund market without the expense and lead time involved in setting up their own infrastructure.� Our expertise in alternative asset servicing also means we know the challenges our clients face, and puts us in a unique position to help guide our clients into the retail space.� 
A recent SEI white paper, Private Fund Managers and the Retail Alternatives Phenomenon, cited that a number of high-profile managers of private fund have already launched or filed for retail products.� Net new flows to alternative mutual funds more than doubled in 2013, totalling $40.4 billion, equivalent to 12.5 percent of all mutual fund flows for the year, according to Strategic Insight.� By the end of the year, 411 alternative funds were available, according to Morningstar, compared with the 165 alternative funds available five years earlier. 
�To succeed in the retail arena, managers of private funds need access to distribution networks and platforms they may have not had to deal with before,� said Mike Beattie, Vice President of SEI�s Investment Manager Services division and President of its Advisors� Inner Circle platform. �They also need a seasoned fund board that can anticipate the complexities involved in bringing alternative strategies into the mutual fund world. Our series trust provides immediate access to those resources.�� 
SEI helped pioneer the series trust concept with the introduction of its first Advisors� Inner Circle in 1991.� The platform has since grown to represent more than $30 billion in fund assets. 
�We anticipate a spike in demand for series trust services from managers of private funds who are seeking to diversify their revenue streams and package their proven strategies for a much broader market,� said Alshefski. �Those who want to get on board with the trend will need ways to streamline and accelerate their market entry.����
