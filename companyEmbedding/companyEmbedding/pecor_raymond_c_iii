An LCTC ferry on the Burlington-Port Kent route


The Lake Champlain Transportation Company (LCTC or just LCT) provides car and passenger ferry service at three points on Lake Champlain in the United States. From 1976 to 2003, it was owned by Burlington, Vermont, businessman Raymond C. Pecor, Jr.[4] who is Chairman of the company's board.[5][6] In 2003, he sold the company to his son, Raymond Pecor III.[7]
Lake Champlain is the thirteenth-largest lake in the United States, reaching a maximum width of 12 miles (19 km) and depths of more than 300 feet (91 m). As such, there is no bridging of the "broad lake" north of Crown Point, New York, and south of the Rouses Point-Alburg-Swanton crossing near the Canada border, though bridging of the lake near Plattsburgh has been proposed.[8] The ferry service allows convenient transport across the lake between New York and Vermont. Approximately one million passengers cross the lake by ferry each year.

Service area[edit]
Service was originally provided at three points, listed from south to north:[9]

Charlotte, VT to Essex, NY
Burlington, VT to Port Kent, NY
Grand Isle, VT to Plattsburgh, NY at Cumberland Head

Most runs employ at least two double-ended diesel ferries, making the crossings in opposite directions. All ferries are capable of carrying large trucks as well as cars, bicycles, and foot passengers and are of a roll-on, roll-off design (although they can operate single-ended in the event of an engine failure). Credit cards are not accepted on some routes.[10] Under the terms of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, vehicles and luggage brought on board some LCT vessels may be subject to search.[11] Most runs are considered quite scenic.[12]
During the summer, the company also provides dinner cruises and charters from Burlington as well as special runs that allow the watching of the Independence Day fireworks display at the Burlington waterfront.
Charlotte–Essex[edit]
The Charlotte–Essex ferry is run year-round, but may not operate if there is heavy icing on the lake. This became a year-round route in 1998 and has operated year-round all but two winters since.[13]
Until the 1920s when the Champlain Bridge was built, this was the primary route for cross-lake travel.[14]
Burlington–Port Kent[edit]
The Burlington–Port Kent ferry crosses the maximum width of the lake and does not operate in the winter.[15] This crossing takes approximately one hour.
Park-and-ride service is available on both ends. Snack/ice cream/gift shop vending available.
Grand Isle–Plattsburgh[edit]
The Grand Isle–Plattsburgh ferry is an ice-breaking route and provides 24-hour service year-round. The crossing on this route takes approximately 12 minutes. In 2001, the company spoke out against a proposed plan to build a bridge that would replace this route.[16]
Crown Point–Chimney Point[edit]

In addition, a temporary ferry operated by the company, for free at the expense of the states of New York and Vermont at a cost to the states of about $10 per car,[17] temporarily operated from Crown Point, New York, to Chimney Point, Vermont. This 20 minute crossing operated 24-hours per day due to the removal of the Champlain Bridge due to structural problems and the construction of a new span.[18][19]
With the opening of the new Lake Champlain Bridge, this ferry crossing was no longer needed so the service ended as of November 7, 2011.[20]
The ferries used by the LCTC[edit]




Plattsburgh, Cumberland, and (in the background) EWW


Ferries used by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company,[21] including six vessels that can run in ice:

The Adirondack (the oldest, in-service, double-ended ferryboat of all time, built 1913,[22] named after the Adirondack Mountains)
The Champlain (built 1930; also doubles as a charter cruise boat for large groups under the brand "Lake Champlain Cruises" )
The Evans Wadhams Wolcott (built 1988 to run in ice; the "EWW", pronounced "E, double-U, double-U" and named after Lewis P. Evans, Jr., Richard H. Wadhams and James G. Wolcott, the founders of the modern company)
The Governor George D. Aiken (built 1975; named after the former governor of Vermont and U.S. Senator)
The Grand Isle (built 1953; was overhauled in the 1995 and extended by 40 feet; this vessel now runs in ice;[23][24] named after the Vermont town but running on the Charlotte-Essex crossing)
The Northern Lights (built 2002 to resemble the steamer Ticonderoga; used for public scenic and charter cruises under the brand "Lake Champlain Cruises."[25])
The Plattsburgh (built 1984 to run in the ice; named after Plattsburgh, New York)
The Valcour (built 1947 from WWII surplus; named after Valcour Island, site of a military battle; this vessel was the last ferry to be built on Lake Champlain and was constructed at the historic Shelburne Shipyard)
The Vermont (built 1992 to run in ice)
The Cumberland (built 2000 to run in ice; named for Cumberland Head, the specific location of the Plattsburgh ferry slip)
The Raymond C. Pecor Jr.,(built 2010) named for Raymond Pecor who ran the company from 1976 to 2004, father of Trey Pecor (aka Raymond Pecor III), the company's current president.[26][27] (Raymond Pecor is also the owner of the Vermont Lake Monsters, a minor league baseball team headquartered in Burlington.)

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 grants totalling approximately $600,000 were used under the National Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program to reduce emissions by the ferries.[28]
History[edit]
From about 1820 to 1850, approximately five horse ferry crossings operated on Lake Champlain.[29]
The Burlington Bay Horse Ferry shipwreck discovered in 1983 in Lake Champlain is an example of a turntable team boat.[30][31] "Horse-powered ferries like the one sunk in the Bay of Burlington, Vermont, had reached their heyday in the 1830's and 40's. Eventually, in the 1850's, the steam boat took over and the days of horse-powered ferries quickly came to an end."[32]
A brief history of the vessels owned by the Lake Champlain Transportation Co. from 1948-2010 is available online.
Ice-breaking on Lake Champlain[edit]

During the winter, Lake Champlain sometimes ices over, making ferry service on the long Burlington-Port Kent route impractical. The Grand Isle-Cumberland Head route is short enough to maintain an open channel, and the distance to the Rouses Point bridge makes it practical for substantial motor traffic to use the ferry, justifying the difficulty of keeping the ferry service operating. The ferries used on this run are of the ice-breaking type; their hulls and propellers are reinforced to allow the boats to operate through thin or broken ice. By operating continuously, the ferries maintain an open channel throughout the winter ice season.
In the past, the ferries did not operate around the clock, but in winter time, a few runs were made through the night to prevent the ice from freezing solidly. Now, scheduled runs continue throughout the night.
Charitable donations[edit]
Lake Champlain Transportation is the largest contributor to the Pecor Family Foundation, contributing over $250,000 in the tax years 2006-2008. The foundation makes large contributions to such charities as the American Cancer Society and United Way, and to educational institutions such as the University of Vermont and Champlain College.[33]

Opposition to a bridge naturally comes from the Lake Champlain Transportation Co., which operates ferry crossings between New York and Vermont. Company spokesman David Schemerhorn said he believes the ferry boats can more than adequately serve transportation needs across the lake. "I think people probably think a bridge would be free and always there, but building a bridge would be no easy feat,’’ Schemerhorn said. About 807,000 vehicles used the ferry between Cumberland Head and Grand Isle, Vt., last year, an all-time high.

An LCTC ferry on the Burlington-Port Kent route


The Lake Champlain Transportation Company (LCTC or just LCT) provides car and passenger ferry service at three points on Lake Champlain in the United States. From 1976 to 2003, it was owned by Burlington, Vermont, businessman Raymond C. Pecor, Jr.[4] who is Chairman of the company's board.[5][6] In 2003, he sold the company to his son, Raymond Pecor III.[7]
Lake Champlain is the thirteenth-largest lake in the United States, reaching a maximum width of 12 miles (19 km) and depths of more than 300 feet (91 m). As such, there is no bridging of the "broad lake" north of Crown Point, New York, and south of the Rouses Point-Alburg-Swanton crossing near the Canada border, though bridging of the lake near Plattsburgh has been proposed.[8] The ferry service allows convenient transport across the lake between New York and Vermont. Approximately one million passengers cross the lake by ferry each year.

Service area[edit]
Service was originally provided at three points, listed from south to north:[9]

Charlotte, VT to Essex, NY
Burlington, VT to Port Kent, NY
Grand Isle, VT to Plattsburgh, NY at Cumberland Head

Most runs employ at least two double-ended diesel ferries, making the crossings in opposite directions. All ferries are capable of carrying large trucks as well as cars, bicycles, and foot passengers and are of a roll-on, roll-off design (although they can operate single-ended in the event of an engine failure). Credit cards are not accepted on some routes.[10] Under the terms of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, vehicles and luggage brought on board some LCT vessels may be subject to search.[11] Most runs are considered quite scenic.[12]
During the summer, the company also provides dinner cruises and charters from Burlington as well as special runs that allow the watching of the Independence Day fireworks display at the Burlington waterfront.
Charlotte–Essex[edit]
The Charlotte–Essex ferry is run year-round, but may not operate if there is heavy icing on the lake. This became a year-round route in 1998 and has operated year-round all but two winters since.[13]
Until the 1920s when the Champlain Bridge was built, this was the primary route for cross-lake travel.[14]
Burlington–Port Kent[edit]
The Burlington–Port Kent ferry crosses the maximum width of the lake and does not operate in the winter.[15] This crossing takes approximately one hour.
Park-and-ride service is available on both ends. Snack/ice cream/gift shop vending available.
Grand Isle–Plattsburgh[edit]
The Grand Isle–Plattsburgh ferry is an ice-breaking route and provides 24-hour service year-round. The crossing on this route takes approximately 12 minutes. In 2001, the company spoke out against a proposed plan to build a bridge that would replace this route.[16]
Crown Point–Chimney Point[edit]

In addition, a temporary ferry operated by the company, for free at the expense of the states of New York and Vermont at a cost to the states of about $10 per car,[17] temporarily operated from Crown Point, New York, to Chimney Point, Vermont. This 20 minute crossing operated 24-hours per day due to the removal of the Champlain Bridge due to structural problems and the construction of a new span.[18][19]
With the opening of the new Lake Champlain Bridge, this ferry crossing was no longer needed so the service ended as of November 7, 2011.[20]
The ferries used by the LCTC[edit]




Plattsburgh, Cumberland, and (in the background) EWW


Ferries used by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company,[21] including six vessels that can run in ice:

The Adirondack (the oldest, in-service, double-ended ferryboat of all time, built 1913,[22] named after the Adirondack Mountains)
The Champlain (built 1930; also doubles as a charter cruise boat for large groups under the brand "Lake Champlain Cruises" )
The Evans Wadhams Wolcott (built 1988 to run in ice; the "EWW", pronounced "E, double-U, double-U" and named after Lewis P. Evans, Jr., Richard H. Wadhams and James G. Wolcott, the founders of the modern company)
The Governor George D. Aiken (built 1975; named after the former governor of Vermont and U.S. Senator)
The Grand Isle (built 1953; was overhauled in the 1995 and extended by 40 feet; this vessel now runs in ice;[23][24] named after the Vermont town but running on the Charlotte-Essex crossing)
The Northern Lights (built 2002 to resemble the steamer Ticonderoga; used for public scenic and charter cruises under the brand "Lake Champlain Cruises."[25])
The Plattsburgh (built 1984 to run in the ice; named after Plattsburgh, New York)
The Valcour (built 1947 from WWII surplus; named after Valcour Island, site of a military battle; this vessel was the last ferry to be built on Lake Champlain and was constructed at the historic Shelburne Shipyard)
The Vermont (built 1992 to run in ice)
The Cumberland (built 2000 to run in ice; named for Cumberland Head, the specific location of the Plattsburgh ferry slip)
The Raymond C. Pecor Jr.,(built 2010) named for Raymond Pecor who ran the company from 1976 to 2004, father of Trey Pecor (aka Raymond Pecor III), the company's current president.[26][27] (Raymond Pecor is also the owner of the Vermont Lake Monsters, a minor league baseball team headquartered in Burlington.)

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 grants totalling approximately $600,000 were used under the National Clean Diesel Funding Assistance Program to reduce emissions by the ferries.[28]
History[edit]
From about 1820 to 1850, approximately five horse ferry crossings operated on Lake Champlain.[29]
The Burlington Bay Horse Ferry shipwreck discovered in 1983 in Lake Champlain is an example of a turntable team boat.[30][31] "Horse-powered ferries like the one sunk in the Bay of Burlington, Vermont, had reached their heyday in the 1830's and 40's. Eventually, in the 1850's, the steam boat took over and the days of horse-powered ferries quickly came to an end."[32]
A brief history of the vessels owned by the Lake Champlain Transportation Co. from 1948-2010 is available online.
Ice-breaking on Lake Champlain[edit]

During the winter, Lake Champlain sometimes ices over, making ferry service on the long Burlington-Port Kent route impractical. The Grand Isle-Cumberland Head route is short enough to maintain an open channel, and the distance to the Rouses Point bridge makes it practical for substantial motor traffic to use the ferry, justifying the difficulty of keeping the ferry service operating. The ferries used on this run are of the ice-breaking type; their hulls and propellers are reinforced to allow the boats to operate through thin or broken ice. By operating continuously, the ferries maintain an open channel throughout the winter ice season.
In the past, the ferries did not operate around the clock, but in winter time, a few runs were made through the night to prevent the ice from freezing solidly. Now, scheduled runs continue throughout the night.
Charitable donations[edit]
Lake Champlain Transportation is the largest contributor to the Pecor Family Foundation, contributing over $250,000 in the tax years 2006-2008. The foundation makes large contributions to such charities as the American Cancer Society and United Way, and to educational institutions such as the University of Vermont and Champlain College.[33]

Lake Champlain Transportation is the largest contributor to the Pecor Family Foundation, contributing over $250,000 in the tax years 2006-2008. The foundation makes large contributions to such charities as the American Cancer Society and United Way, and to educational institutions such as the University of Vermont and Champlain College.[33]

Opposition to a bridge naturally comes from the Lake Champlain Transportation Co., which operates ferry crossings between New York and Vermont. Company spokesman David Schemerhorn said he believes the ferry boats can more than adequately serve transportation needs across the lake. "I think people probably think a bridge would be free and always there, but building a bridge would be no easy feat,’’ Schemerhorn said. About 807,000 vehicles used the ferry between Cumberland Head and Grand Isle, Vt., last year, an all-time high.

PSB approves sale of Burlington Telecom to local investor 





Tweet



  





 

Vermont Business Magazine The City of Burlington received permission from the Vermont Public Service Board to sell the assets of Burlington Telecom to a local investor in an order dated November 3, 2014, but the city will continue to be responsible for the operation of the telephone, cable and Internet provider. Under the agreement, the city will fund the largest component of the city's $9.03 million settlement payment with Citibank through a sale of substantially all the assets of Burlington Telecom to Blue Water Holdings LLC, which will then lease BT's assets back to the city. Blue Water is a Vermont limited liability company formed by Raymond C Pecor III as owner and managing member, as part of a sale and operating lease financing. Pecor and his family are the owner/operators of the Lake Champlain Transportation ferries and the Lake Monsters minor league baseball team, among other things. 
Mayor Miro Weinberger said Monday: “Today's unanimous decision by the Vermont Public Service Board, following months of careful review and analysis, is great news for the people of Burlington. The PSB’s decision – both approving  the Settlement Agreement that my Administration negotiated earlier this year and determining that all existing and ongoing violations of Burlington Telecom’s certificate of public good are resolved – moves the City another major step closer to putting the financial uncertainty caused by the mismanagement of BT fully behind us. I want to thank the PSB for the care and due diligence the Board and staff brought to this process. We now will move quickly to implement the Settlement Agreement.”
The PSB order (CLICK HERE) said that for more than five years, the city and its finances have been burdened by the consequences of actions taken by former city officials in funding investments in Burlington Telecom from 2007 to 2009. The most serious of these continuing burdens involve the potential exposure of the city of more than $33.5 million in the Citibank Lawsuit and the consequences of an unauthorized $16.9 million investment by the city in BT that was funded through non- reimbursed short-term advances to BT. The officials now in charge of the city's government and administration were not responsible for the city's actions that led to the Citibank Lawsuit, the city's unauthorized funding of investments in BT, or the CPG violations found by the Board in October 2010.  
As proposed, the largest component of the City of Burlington's $9.03 million settlement payment will consist of the $6 million Blue Water will pay to the city upon the sale by the city of BT's assets to Blue Water under a proposed sale and operating lease financing. Blue Water will lease BT's assets back to the city for a maximum five-year lease term and will retain ownership of BT's assets during and after the term of the Lease unless there is a sale of BT's assets to another private entity. During the Lease term, monthly rental payments of $46,500 ($558,000 a year) will be made to Blue Water from BT's net cash flow. The rental payment amount reflects a 7% interest rate and a 20-year schedule of amortization on $6 million. Under the proposed financing, the city will have the right to direct a subsequent sale of BT's assets during the first four years of the operating lease. If an agreement for sale is entered into within three years, the city will ultimately receive 25% of the net proceeds of the sale (after payment to Blue Water of the remaining unamortized balance of $6 million and other deductions) or 17.5% of such proceeds if an agreement for sale is entered into within four years. There is no assurance there will be any future sale of BT's assets (or any recovery of the city's investment in BT) if the city is unable to direct a sale of BT's assets within four years at or above a pre-approved price. 
Because of the increased performance lately of Burlington Telecom, the PSB suggested that a better end result could be for the city to pay off Citibank with a revenue bond. This had not previously been suggested by any of the parties. Ultimately, the PSB acknowledged that this was not a practical alternative to the complex Blue Water deal. Citibank did not support a plan that would have required voter approval, which its uncertain outcome, and it would have extended the process upwards of another nine months. 
The PSB wrote:
"No party presented evidence opposing the proposed Blue Water sale and lease financing. In fact, all parties to this proceeding support the Board's approval of the proposed Blue Water sale and lease financing.
"Although alternatives to the Blue Water sale and lease financing to fund the Citibank settlement may have been possible, the Board concludes it is in the general good of the state to allow the City administration and the City Council to make the funding and financing decisions with respect to the Citibank Settlement that they believe best serve the interests of the City and its taxpayers. On this basis, the Board approves the Blue Water sale and lease financing."
While it is unclear, as the PSB states, what role Blue Water will have going forward, the PSB supported the conclusion that the city would be responsible for the operation of Burlington Telecom.
The PSB wrote: "After the sale of BT's Assets to Blue Water, the City will continue to be the licensed operator of Burlington Telecom and intends to continue to assume responsibility for compliance with the CPG and other regulatory requirements. The Board agrees with the City and the Department that the City, as BT's licensed operator, remains the appropriate entity to be held primarily responsible for compliance with the CPG and other regulatory requirements so long as the City remains the holder of the CPG to operate Burlington Telecom. As the Department suggests in its brief: "Board oversight over Blue Water, as owner of the BT Assets, should be less than that of the City, as the operator of BT." 
The city's, and consequently Burlington International Airport's, bond rating suffered and the cost of borrowing money has been more expensive because of it. However, as of April 14, 2014, Moody's changed the outlook for the city's Baa3 bond rating from negative to stable. An improvement in the city's bond rating, the PSB wrote, would lower the interest costs on new bond issuances by the city and might allow the city to lower its debt service costs by refinancing some of its outstanding bonds.
