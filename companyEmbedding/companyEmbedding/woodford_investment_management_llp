At Woodford, it is very important to us that investors understand their investments and how they are being managed. We are keen to ensure the right people are invested in the right funds for the right reasons and can continually make informed investment decisions based on what’s right for them.
We offer investors a choice of three funds – all offering access to the investment expertise of Neil Woodford, one of the most respected fund managers of his generation. See the key differences between the three funds.
The CF Woodford Income Focus Fund is our newest fund. It has been developed to meet the demand from our investors for a fund offering a higher level of regular and sustainable income, with no compromise on quality
The CF Woodford Equity Income Fund is the original Woodford fund. It sits in the Investment Association (IA) UK Equity Income sector, aiming to offer investors capital growth and a growing income stream, paid quarterly.

George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Home > Us > Careers 















At Woodford, we believe we have created a unique culture – a carefully selected mix of individuals with very different personal and professional backgrounds, specialisms, skills, experience and expertise, who share a vision for how a fund management company can and should operate.
We are building a transformational fund management business – but we believe that the most modern of businesses still requires traditional values. Our core principles are fundamental to our culture, to how we manage money and how we behave as a business and all of our actions, individually and as a business, are guided by these principles:
Clients first
A complete focus on client outcomes and the long-term management of our clients’ money
High performance
High performance is demanded in our business – nowhere more so than in our determination to deliver positive long-term returns for our clients
Integrity
We expect the highest professional standards from all our people
Simplicity
We’ve worked hard to strip out the unnecessary in the pursuit of simplicity
Transparency
We are committed to an environment of openness, transparency and regular dialogue with our clients. We will always answer the question ‘Why?’
Compliance
We understand regulation and require compliance expertise throughout our business
Innovation
We are delivering a first-class operating experience for our clients and our people through investment in technology and cutting-edge outsourcing models
The principles are underpinned by a common theme – a complete focus on the long-term management of our clients’ money.
The result is a creative, collaborative and supportive environment – but we also demand a lot from our team. We select only individuals with a proven track record and the confidence and character to challenge the business to continually evolve and improve.
We are based in Oxford and we offer outstanding opportunities for industry professionals who share our vision and embrace our culture and can help us build Woodford into a strong and stable, multi-generational business.
Current vacancies are shown below and updated regularly. If you think you have what it takes to join us, we’d love to hear from you.
If you are interested in any of the positions, please email your CV using the button at the end of the job description, together with a covering letter including a brief summary of what you think you could bring to both the role and the wider Woodford team. We’ll email you back shortly after the closing date shown to let you know whether we’re taking your application further.
Please note that successful candidates will be asked to provide evidence of their Right to Work in the UK before being permitted to work with us.

A unique investment proposition

The original Woodford fund, completely focused on delivering attractive long-term returns for investors through investment in quality companies that can deliver sustainable dividend growth
Investors expect a positive return and that is what we aim to deliver over the long term – protecting capital is key
We aim to offer investors capital growth and a growing income stream, paid quarterly
We focus on the long term – we don’t know what will happen tomorrow but we do know what drives markets over time

An investment team that shares a single goal

The fund is managed by Neil Woodford, an outstanding fund manager for more than 25 years who has consistently delivered outstanding long-term performance to investors
Neil is supported by a dedicated team that shares his approach and commitment to the goal of exceptional long-term performance for our clients
Three experienced fund managers work with Neil – each with a different skill set for depth of cross-market coverage
Three specialist analysts support the fund managers, providing them with valuable analysis and support on specific investment opportunities

A proven and distinctive approach

The ‘Woodford philosophy’ – a consistent and proven approach to investment that has delivered outstanding long-term performance for investors
We only invest when there is a compelling long-term opportunity – we will not invest in stocks just to make the fund look more like the index
We buy stakes in businesses and help them to fulfill their potential and deliver shareholder value. In this way, believe we can beat the market over the long term
We believe we can beat the market over the long term

Why invest with us now?

Advised investors with varied levels of interest, knowledge, confidence and experience

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
