Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."

What People Are Saying About FragranceX.com








I checked two online websites to compare value and found FragranceX was the best. I have used this website previously so felt very comfortable when placing my order.








Terri V
Milford, MI, USA





I just love Fragrancex and have been purchasing from this online store for a number of years now. I have recommended the site to many people and they too are always extremely happy with their purchase. I even buy my son's aftershaves through Fragrancex!! I always get free delivery and as a loyal customer I also get an extra 10% discount of my purchases...... Yay!!!!








Susan K
Caulfield, Australia














I order always on fragrance X because they are the best. The products are cheap but with an excellent quality. I wait only 6 days to have my products into my hands ,however i live in Europe. That's great. I recommend this website! Thanks to fragrance x. 








Florence G
Vedène, France











I was very happy with my order placed with FragranceX.com and would recommend to any friend. I was kept updated on the progress of my items and they arrived well within time. I don't think I could have got much cheaper anywhere else and know and trust this site. Thank you!
