Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Capitalize on economic and market trends
Maximize long-term, risk-adjusted performance

We monitor economic, political, and financial market environments, assess their potential impact and make the necessary adjustments to protect and grow your assets.

Investment Philosophy
A Disciplined and Proactive Strategy
A proactive, strategic approach to investment management is essential in today’s dynamic markets and global economy. Legacy’s disciplined investment process employs a combination of quantitative screening, fundamental analysis, and the knowledge and experience of our portfolio managers.
To build a portfolio that is tailored to meet your investment time horizon, risk tolerance, and long-term income and growth needs, we implement personalized investment strategies through:

A core allocation of carefully screened large capitalization equities for long-term growth opportunities
A selection of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to diversify across multiple asset classes

Securing Retirement
Living Your Retirement Dreams
Making the decision to retire can be one of the most thrilling, yet frightening times of your life. Legacy’s financial planning and investment professionals will help you confront many of the biggest questions you might have:

What is the best way to replace earned income with investment cash flow?
How will my tax liabilities change?
Is it time to sell the family home and divide the year between two residences?
When should I begin receiving Social Security benefits?
What is the best way to compare medical insurance programs?

Taking a thorough inventory of assets, calculating income, and measuring expenses and spending needs are the first steps to formulating your retirement plan. With your goals and dreams in focus, Legacy will work with you to create a personalized financial plan and investment strategy to guide you into a secure retirement so you can reap the benefits of your life’s work.
Legacy wants you to have the peace of mind that results from comprehensive and thoughtful planning. Retirement is an achievement and you have earned the right to enjoy it to the fullest.

                When planning for your retirement, Bo will help you answer the questions that will define your personal investment strategy. He will continuously monitor performance, and recommend adjustments as needed so that you can retire with confidence.

Trustee Services
Benefits of a Trust
Trusts are used to determine how assets are distributed during one’s lifetime or after passing away. They are a tool used to transfer wealth between generations and to make provisions for a spouse, minor and adult children and non-family members such as long-time employees, companions, friends or charities. At Legacy Private Trust we are here to administer your trusts. Please remember we do not draft Wills, Codicils or Trust Deeds and cannot provide specific advice, but we can direct you to professionals who do and work closely with them to help create the best possible plan for you.
There are many benefits to a trust whether it is established during one’s lifetime or in a Will or Codicil. The following is a list of a few of the ways you can benefit from using a trust:

To manage assets for a spouse or child who is unable to do so
For tax planning and income splitting
To freeze an estate to minimize capital gains and access capital gains exemptions
To hold private company shares in trust for succession purposes
To protect assets
For planned charitable giving
To reduce probate taxes
To keep an arrangement between a settlor and beneficiary confidential
To create a flexible and creative plan
To provide for a beneficiary with special needs
To provide for a new spouse and children from a previous marriage at the same time

Types of Trusts
Trusts are such flexible tools that naming all of the different variations would be impossible. We have outlined some of the more common types below. Within the limitless scope of trusts there are two main categories of trusts:

Inter vivos trusts (living trusts created through a Trust Deed during the settlors lifetime)
Testamentary trusts (a trust that is created through a Will or Codicil).

Legacy Private Trust can act in many fiduciary capacities, such as Trustee, co-Trustee, alternate Trustee or Agent for a Trustee, in any of the following situations:
Inter vivos Trust (Living Trust)
These types of trusts are established during someone’s lifetime with instructions given to the Trustee on how the assets will be used for the beneficiaries. These types of trusts can continue after one passes away, but, they are exempt from probate taxes because they are not considered part of one’s estate and are completely confidential because they never become part of the public record like Wills do when they go through the probate process. Other benefits of this type of trust are confidentiality of assets and beneficiaries and protection of your estate assets from creditors. This can be a concern because creditors can sometimes make claims on the assets in your estate that are not in a trust.
Family and Personal Trusts
These types of trusts can be set up for yourself or your family for income splitting, succession planning, to provide for someone with poor financial management skills, to lower probate fees and for other tax planning purposes.
Joint Partner Trusts
These types of trusts are designed to make sure you, your partner and your assets are taken care of should you become incapable. They allow you to determine exactly how you and your spouse will be cared for personally and financially, and how your assets will be managed and administered. When one partner passes away the surviving partner becomes the sole beneficiary of the trust. When the surviving partner passes away other named beneficiaries such as children, charities and foundations become the beneficiaries.
Alter Ego Trusts
Alter ego trusts will provide for you during your lifetime with all the benefits of a personal trust and also allow for you to name secondary beneficiaries of the trust for when you have passed away.
Blind Trusts
These types of trusts are designed for avoiding conflicts of interest and are perfect for politically exposed people, but these trusts could be used in other circumstances. In a blind trust the Trustee is given full discretion over the assets in the trust. The key to this type of trust is that the beneficiary, usually also the settlor, is unaware of the activity or investments made in the trust and therefore avoids any conflict of interest that could arise. These types of trusts can be established for a temporary situation.
Henson Trusts
A Henson trust is a way for you to enhance the financial security of a loved one with a disability.  It allows your loved one to receive a gift worth any amount without also facing a reduction in the benefits he or she receives from a provincial or territorial government program. Financial gifts made outside of a Henson trust can result in a claw back of government benefits. Henson trusts must be fully discretionary trusts.
Settlement Trusts
Sometimes a Trustee is required when there is a settlement resulting from a Class Action or a Personal Injury lawsuit. Legacy Private Trust is fully licensed and regulated to take on such appointments.
Charitable Remainder Trusts
This type of trust is used to support your loved ones for a period of time and to help a charitable organization of your choice. The income beneficiaries benefit from the income generated from the assets in the trust and the chosen charitable organization benefits from the remaining capital once the trust has run its course as dictated by you in your Trust Deed. These types of trusts can also be transferred into a foundation.
Retirement Compensation Arrangements (RCAs)
An RCA is an unregistered retirement plan used to supplement a pension or RRSP. It is funded by one’s employer and is payable on retirement or termination. These arrangements spread out taxable income over a longer period of time so you pay income tax at a lower rate and less tax overall. These are good for people selling their businesses, athletes and other people who will be generating a high-income over a relatively short period of time. An RCA is tax-deductible for the employer.
International Trusts
For those with international legacy building requirements we have correspondent trust companies in a variety of jurisdictions. These correspondents can assist in acting as a Trustee for a variety of international trusts.
Asset Protection Trusts
Asset Protection Trusts are useful for protecting important assets from litigation, bankruptcy or other situations. These types of trusts are especially useful to protect corporate assets, but the planning must be done properly to ensure that certain legal considerations are taken into account. Doctors, lawyers and other professionals often find them useful.
Condominium Insurance Trusts
Condominium corporations are required under the law to hold their insurance in trust. Legacy Private Trust is able to hold such insurance in trust.
Cemetery Trusts
Cemeteries, by law, are required to have Care and Maintenance & Monument trusts. They are also required to have trusts in some cases for proceeds from prepaid services. Legacy Private Trust is able to manage and administer cemetery trust funds.
Funeral Home Trusts
Funeral Homes are required by law in some cases to have trusts for prepaid services.  Legacy Private Trust is able to manage and administer funeral home trust funds.
First Nations Trusts
First Nations or Aboriginal trusts can be used as a way to preserve culture and provide for generations to come by protecting key assets such as settlement income and resource revenue.
Immigration Trusts

In-bound Migrant Trusts
This type of trust is designed for people coming to Canada. It allows you to bring assets into the country tax free for up to five years through the establishment of an In-Bound Migrant Trust.
Out-bound Non-resident Trusts
This type of trust is designed for those who hold assets (usually real estate) in Canada, but wish to sever residential ties. By setting up an Out-Bound Non-Resident Trust you can enjoy the benefits of owning property in Canada without paying the taxes associated with being a Canadian resident. The trust provides you with the flexibility to live in another country without having to pay residential taxes in two jurisdictions.


Testamentary Trusts
These types of trusts are established in a Will and become active when one passes away.
Family and Personal Trusts
These types of trusts can be set up for yourself or your family for income splitting, succession planning, to provide for someone with poor financial management skills, to lower probate taxes and for other tax planning purposes.
Spousal Trusts
This type of trust is established when a partner passes away and provides for the surviving partner. It allows you to determine exactly how you or your partner will be cared for personally and financially, and how your assets will be managed and administered. When the surviving partner passes away other named beneficiaries become entitled to the benefits of the trust.
Henson Trusts
A Henson trust is a way for you to enhance the financial security of a loved one with a disability.  It allows your loved one to receive a gift worth any amount without also facing a reduction in the benefits he or she receives from a provincial or territorial government program. Financial gifts made outside of a Henson trust can result in a claw back of government benefits. Henson trusts must be fully discretionary trusts.
Charitable Remainder Trusts
This type of trust is used to support your loved ones for a period of time and to help a charitable organization of your choice. The income beneficiaries benefit from the income generated from the assets in the trust and the chosen charitable organization benefits from the remaining capital once the trust has run its course as dictated by you in your Will or Trust Deed. These types of trusts can also be transferred into a foundation.
Inter-Generational Trusts
The ultimate legacy can be achieved through the establishment of an Inter-Generational Trust. These types of trusts can work in a number of ways, but the basic tenet is that the trust provides for your growing family for generations to come. The most common type is the per stirpes type where each branch of the family receives an equal share.
How Can Legacy Private Trust Help?
At Legacy Private Trust we can act as a Trustee, co-Trustee, alternate Trustee or as an Agent for a Trustee in all sorts of situations.  Often a Trustee is unable to perform the duties alone due to:

Illness
A period where business or personal responsibilities are heavy
Travels outside of the province for an extended period of time each year
Discomfort with the multitude of tax, accounting, trust administration and asset management tasks that are all part of a Trustee’s job
The archaic trust accounting rules, so unlike business accounting rules

Whether asked to perform all or most of a Trustee’s functions during the whole or part of the period of the Trusteeship, Legacy Private Trust has the expertise to help.



"A trust is such a flexible legacy building tool." - James B. Love,  Founder

Charity and Non-Profit Services
One key aspect in any estate plan is the careful consideration of charitable giving.  Some prefer to give an outright gift through their Wills, while others choose to leave a lasting gift in the form of a charitable remainder trust or a private foundation.  At Legacy Private Trust we can assist families in many ways to ensure that their gift is lasting. Expert management will leave the important task of choosing the appropriate recipients of the charitable gifts to the family, while leaving the administrative tasks to the professionals at Legacy Private Trust.
Private Foundations
We offer services to help you complete the gruelling tasks associated with establishing your own private foundation. Once it is setup you can also appoint us as Agent to do the administrative work. We are flexible and can provide customized packages with partial or full backroom administrative functions and granting services, enabling you and your family to focus on charitable giving.
The Legacy Private Trust Foundation
The Legacy Private Trust Foundation allows you to achieve your charitable goals without undertaking the start-up costs, lengthy processes and administrative tasks associated with establishing your own private foundation. It can also be useful for those who have determined that the amount they wish to give for charitable purposes does not warrant their own private foundation.

Donor-advised Funds
With a Donor-advised Fund you make a single or a series of donations to the Legacy Private Trust Foundation to be held by it in a separate fund in your name or a name determined by you.  The Legacy Private Trust Foundation will provide you with a charitable receipt for each of your donations. Unlike some other foundations that provide Donor-advised Funds, you then have the option of appointing your own investment professional to manage the assets. In either case when you determine the assets can be passed onto charities of your choice it can be in a lump sum, a series of donations or over a longer period of time.
Temporary Holding Place
It has become surprisingly commonplace for individuals to encounter a situation where they wish to endow their own private foundation. However, the timing can often be problematic because the establishment and registration of a private foundation usually takes a year to complete. Instead we offer the Legacy Private Trust Foundation as a temporary holding place.  Make the proposed contribution to a segregated Donor-advised Fund within the Legacy Private Trust Foundation, obtain your tax receipt and your capital gains tax relief earlier and then set about establishing your own private foundation. Once it is set-up up you can easily transfer the assets to your own private foundation and also appoint us as Agent to do the administrative work.
Anonymous Giving
Being anonymous in charitable giving can be a matter of preference, ranging from full anonymity to a wish that a gift not be advertised in a program or donor listing.  However, those wishing to remain fully anonymous may be forced to use bank drafts to keep the source of the donation confidential and will therefore not be issued a tax receipt. Legacy Private Trust can provide the best of both worlds. A donation can be made to the Legacy Private Trust Foundation and a charitable receipt issued. We will then make the donation on your behalf to your selected charity using the Legacy Private Trust Foundation name, guaranteeing your privacy and anonymity.
Direct Donation
For some people it may be convenient to make a direct donation to the Legacy Private Trust Foundation to receive their tax receipt instantly and have the Foundation’s Board of Directors decide how the charitable donation will be used.




"At Legacy Private Trust we can assist families in many ways to ensure that their gift is lasting." - James B. Love,  Founder

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
