On the radar
From our early days as Urban Compass, with a single downtown Manhattan office, through our evolution into the national force we are today, the press has been covering our rapid growth — our entrepreneurial people and our integrated platform. 




“And it’s no wonder Compass has shaken things up: As anyone who’s ever tried to rent or buy property in New York knows, the experience is loaded with pain points — exactly the type of stuff that turns mere ideas into thriving startups.”




“While Compass functions like a traditional broker, the company's promise is using technology to reduce the time and friction of buying and selling a house or apartment... last month Compass released an app designed to replace ‘stale’ quarterly market reports with more dynamic information."




“While other startups struggle to access new funding, Compass was able to raise money because its revenue is growing quickly... Compass has passed $100 million in revenue so far this year.”

There’s lots to love about Thursday’s EDCO Pubtalk. First we are excited to see many friends of StartupBend presenting including Zilaida Salgueiro, founder of Locals Compass, Eric Dubs, founder of DubsLabs and inventor of Versafit headphones and Bedphones, and Kent Schnepp, founder of Odysys.
The keynote speaker is Scott Sandler, fund manager for the Oregon Angel Fund.
According to EDCO:

OAF aims to invest $100M in 100 local startups that create 10,000 jobs in Oregon. As OAF’s Fund Manager for the past five years, Keynote Scott Sandler has been an integral part in making that happen. He also knows a thing or two about what makes a successful investment. This keynote will guide startups and entrepreneurs through different strategies for funding and how to choose the most optimal path to securing investment.

Here’s a bit more about Locals Compass:

With their official launch just last month, travel marketplace Locals Compass has started to offer personalized itineraries for travelers in their first market: Bend, Oregon. The startup taps into local’s knowledge using personalized itineraries that meet traveler’s interests. Traveling with kids in tow? An avid outdoorsman? A foodie with dietary restrictions? They’re all covered.

If you’d like to give Locals Compass a try, they’re running a special for StartupBend readers this month. You still have a few days!

Eric, from DubsLabs, always inspires us with his inventions and general life hacks (ask him about his no email quest). According to EDCO:



DubsLabs created the world’s thinnest headphones, perfect for wearing to bed to drown out that snoring partner. Their next product will utilize the same technology, giving athletes that use headphones a much safer option.



And finally, Kent Schnepp, with Odysys will give a company update:

In October 2015, Odysys won the Bend Venture Conference. Since then, they have continued to grow and develop their marketing & tech software for independent hotels. Kent will give an update on the company and their next steps.

                    Community Giving: The BBVA Compass Foundation


















Supporting nonprofits in our communities 
An opportunity to grant bright futures
The BBVA Compass Foundation demonstrates our support to the communities where we have a presence. The Foundation provides charitable grants to qualified nonprofit organizations – a long and proud tradition of the many banks that came together to create the company we are today.

Each community has unique needs and opportunities. We designate the majority of our community giving dollars to addressing these needs. Charitable grants are considered for organizations that meet the criteria described below. At the bottom of this section, you will find information about semi-monthly calls held for nonprofits interested in requesting support from the BBVA Compass Foundation, along with links to begin the application process.
