Now that they’re out of Cablevision Systems, Kristin and James Dolan are trying their hand at a new family business: venture capital.
The married couple announced the launch of Dolan Family Ventures, focused on investments in data, analytics and technology-based businesses. European telecom conglomerate Altice Group last year acquired Cablevision for $17.7 billion, and both Dolans — along with the rest of Cablevision’s management team — exited the New York-area cable operator.
Dolan Family Ventures will be led by Kristin Dolan, formerly COO of Cablevision, as managing partner. James Dolan, previously Cablevision’s CEO, is an investor in DFV and a strategic adviser. The new company did not disclose the size of its fund.







“DFV will allow us to pursue opportunities with companies and talent that can benefit from our capital, insights, relationships, entrepreneurial experience and operational skills to accelerate their growth, development and success,” Kristin Dolan said in a statement.
Investment banking firm PJT Partners is providing consulting services to Dolan Family Ventures. PJT was one of the financial advisers to Cablevision in its sale to Altice.
James Dolan owns the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, and executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Co. In addition, he is executive chairman of MSG Networks, which became a standalone company following the 2015 spin-off of the Madison Square Garden Co. and serves on the board of directors for MSG, MSG Networks and AMC Networks.

This is a great strategic move by Kristin and Jimmy. I think it will be an awesome pivot as the restrictions of geography and government limited Cablevision’s growth. Having the courage and insight to get out at that time was brilliant given all of the recent consolidation in the telecom industry.

BETHPAGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cablevision Systems Corporation (NYSE:CVC) today announced the 
      promotions of two long-time senior executives. Brian G. Sweeney has been 
      named President and Kristin A. Dolan has been appointed Chief Operating 
      Officer (COO) of Cablevision Systems Corporation. Along with these new 
      positions, both were elected executive officers of the Company. These 
      leadership appointments are effective immediately and Mr. Sweeney and 
      Ms. Dolan will report to Cablevision Chief Executive Officer James L. 
      Dolan. Mr. Dolan will no longer serve as president of the Company.
    

      As President, Mr. Sweeney, who has been with Cablevision for more than 
      two decades, will continue to work closely with Cablevision’s CEO on the 
      long-term strategic direction and the overall management of the Company. 
      He will also work with Ms. Dolan and the Company’s other senior 
      executives on the day-to-day oversight of the Company’s operations. He 
      maintains direct oversight of the Company’s key strategic initiatives, 
      the engineering, technology and business intelligence groups as well as 
      Cablevision’s local media properties, including Newsday Media Group and 
      News 12 Networks.
    

      In addition to working with the Cablevision senior executive team on the 
      long-term strategy of the Company, Ms. Dolan, a 24-year veteran of 
      Cablevision, will lead all aspects of the Company’s cable operations as 
      chief operating officer. This includes responsibility for the entire 
      Optimum customer experience from network management and product 
      development to marketing and customer and field service for the 
      Company’s residential and commercial Optimum TV digital cable, Optimum 
      Online high-speed Internet and Optimum voice products. She also will 
      continue to oversee Cablevision Media Sales, the Company’s advertising 
      sales division.
    

      In addition to his ongoing role as Cablevision Vice Chairman and Chief 
      Financial Officer, Gregg Seibert will continue to oversee the Lightpath 
      business.
    

      Cablevision CEO James L. Dolan stated, “Brian and Kristin have each 
      played critical senior roles in our efforts over the past two years to 
      reposition Cablevision as a leader in customer service and product 
      innovation in this industry. Their decades of experience, strong 
      leadership, technical expertise and sharp business acumen have helped to 
      propel Cablevision forward during a time of great change.”
    

      Regarding Mr. Sweeney, James Dolan said, “For more than 20 years, Brian 
      has consistently demonstrated superb judgment as he acquired a deep 
      understanding of our business, and built strong relationships internally 
      and across the industry. He has worked by my side helping to drive the 
      operational initiatives and the cultural change needed to achieve our 
      goals. I have confidence in Brian’s exceptional capabilities and in his 
      clear vision of Cablevision’s future prospects.”
    

      Regarding Kristin Dolan, Mr. Dolan said, “Kristin has effectively guided 
      a complete transformation of the Optimum experience for our customers in 
      a fiercely competitive environment. She has a keen grasp of every aspect 
      of the cable and advertising sales operations and a core commitment to 
      putting the customer at the forefront of everything we do. As we move to 
      capitalize on the significant opportunities that lie ahead for 
      Cablevision, I am certain that Kristin will continue to provide 
      exemplary leadership and operational focus as we work to meet our 
      customers’ evolving expectations.”
    

      Said Mr. Sweeney, “During the last two years, Cablevision has made 
      substantial progress towards becoming a more efficient, customer-focused 
      organization. I look forward to continuing my work with Jim and the 
      entire leadership team to accelerate innovation as we identify emerging 
      trends and opportunities for long-term, sustainable growth – for our 
      employees, our customers and our shareholders.”
    

      Ms. Dolan added, “I am very proud of what we’ve accomplished so far, and 
      Cablevision’s future holds even more promise. Looking ahead, we will 
      continue our efforts to deliver superior value and service to Optimum 
      customers by providing expanded connectivity, unmatched products and 
      peerless service. Those features will differentiate the Optimum 
      experience for current and future customers.”

      Mr. Sweeney, 49, has held positions of increasing responsibility since 
      joining Cablevision more than two decades ago. Most recently, he served 
      as senior executive vice president, strategy and chief of staff to the 
      CEO, overseeing corporate strategy and the Company’s key growth 
      initiatives as well as the long-term planning process. Over the past two 
      years, working closely with the CEO, Mr. Sweeney has driven operational 
      efficiency and strategic alignment across all areas of the company.
    

      Prior to this role, he served as senior vice president of e-media, where 
      he helped to develop and execute the Company’s technology and 
      engineering objectives, and provided development and operational support 
      for Cablevision’s interactive and mobile applications, its broadband 
      video delivery systems, and the consumer-oriented websites. Mr. Sweeney 
      began his career in 1993 at Cablevision's programming division Rainbow 
      Media (now AMC Networks) as vice president of information systems. While 
      in this role, he was responsible for all application development and 
      information systems support for the Rainbow-managed cable networks.
    

      Mr. Sweeney serves as a member of Cablevision's board of directors, and 
      is also on the board of directors at AMC Networks and The Madison Square 
      Garden Company. He received his MBA in finance from the Wharton School 
      at the University of Pennsylvania and his bachelor’s degree in computer 
      science from the University of Virginia.

      A 24-year company veteran, Ms. Dolan, 48, most recently served as 
      President of Optimum Services where she was responsible for the Optimum 
      products, brand positioning and customer service. She led the Company’s 
      efforts to transform the customer experience by introducing new products 
      and product enhancements, including faster broadband speeds, the full 
      deployment of the Onyx platform and an enhanced multi-room DVR product. 
      Additionally, she has been instrumental in guiding Cablevision’s 
      large-scale expansion of its Optimum WiFi network and continued 
      investment in Cablevision’s broadband product.
    

      Prior to this role, Ms. Dolan was senior executive vice president, 
      product management, marketing and development, and led the reimaging and 
      reintroduction of the Optimum brand as well as numerous product and 
      service advancements.
    

      Ms. Dolan began her career in 1990 with Cablevision’s Rainbow Media (now 
      AMC Networks). She worked in a variety of sales and marketing positions 
      with increasing levels of responsibility. In 2000, she joined 
      Cablevision as vice president of field communications and was later 
      named vice president of digital product management, where she led the 
      development, launch and continued evolution of the company’s Optimum TV 
      digital cable service. Ms. Dolan was then appointed senior vice 
      president of digital product management, responsible for the 
      Cablevision’s digital and analog video products, its high-speed Internet 
      product and the strategic direction for the launch of Optimum Voice in 
      2003.
    

      Ms. Dolan serves as a member of Cablevision's board of directors, and is 
      also on the board of directors at AMC Networks and The Madison Square 
      Garden Company. She received her M.S. in publishing with a concentration 
      in marketing from Pace University and a B.A. in English from the State 
      University of New York at Albany. She is currently a candidate for a 
      master’s degree in English literature.

Cablevision has announced management changes, including naming former President of Optimum Services Kristin Dolan as COO





Cablevision Systems finally found a replacement for former chief operating officer Tom Rutledge, and she was part of the family all along.
Cablevision said it has named former president of Optimum Services Kristin Dolan as COO, effective immediately. In addition CEO James Dolan – her husband – said he would relinquish one of his titles – president – to his brother-in-law Brian Sweeney.
According to reports, the Dolans announced a trial separation last year, but are still married. Cablevision declined to comment on their personal relationship.
In her new role, Kristin Dolan occupies a spot that has been vacant since former COO Tom Rutledge resigned from the company in 2011. Rutledge currently is CEO of Charter Communications.
Dolan has been moving steadily up the ranks. She was named president of Optimum Services last April, responsible for all Optimum products, brand positioning and customer service. Dolan has a strong background in marketing and les efforts to introduce new products and product enhancements, including faster broadband speeds and oversaw the rollout of its Onyx platform. A 24-year veteran of the company, she will lead all aspects of its cable operations, including  responsibility for network management and product development to marketing and customer and field service for the its residential and commercial cable, high-speed Internet and voice products.  She also will continue to oversee Cablevision Media Sales, the company’s advertising sales division.
“Kristin has effectively guided a complete transformation of the Optimum experience for our customers in a fiercely competitive environment. She has a keen grasp of every aspect of the cable and advertising sales operations and a core commitment to putting the customer at the forefront of everything we do,” James Dolan said in a statement. “As we move to capitalize on the significant opportunities that lie ahead for Cablevision, I am certain that Kristin will continue to provide exemplary leadership and operational focus as we work to meet our customers’ evolving expectations.”
Sweeney, who most recently served as senior executive vice president, strategy and chief of staff to the CEO and has been with the Cablevision for more than two decades, will continue to work closely with the CEO on the long-term strategic direction and the overall management of the company.  He will also work with Kristin Dolan and the company’s other senior executives on the day-to-day oversight of the company’s operations.  He maintains direct oversight of the company’s key strategic initiatives, the engineering, technology and business intelligence groups as well as Cablevision’s local media properties, including Newsday Media Group and News 12 Networks.
 “For more than 20 years, Brian has consistently demonstrated superb judgment as he acquired a deep understanding of our business, and built strong relationships internally and across the industry,” James Dolan said in a statement. “He has worked by my side helping to drive the operational initiatives and the cultural change needed to achieve our goals. I have confidence in Brian’s exceptional capabilities and in his clear vision of Cablevision’s future prospects.”
In addition to his ongoing role as Cablevision vice chairman and CFO, Gregg Seibert will continue to oversee the Lightpath business.

      initiatives as well as the long-term planning process. Over the past two 
      years, working closely with the CEO, Mr. Sweeney has driven operational 
      efficiency and strategic alignment across all areas of the company.
    

      Prior to this role, he served as senior vice president of e-media, where

      video delivery systems, and the consumer-oriented websites. Mr. Sweeney

Cablevision Builds Its First Branding Campaign In A Decade Around “Optimum”

The new sales effort puts a spotlight on Kristin Dolan, who’s Cablevision‘s senior EVP Product Management and Marketing — and also happens to be the wife of CEO Jim Dolan, and a member of the boards of Cablevision, AMC Networks, and Madison Square Garden. A long-time Cablevision employee, she formally took charge of Cablevision’s image machine last November. But analysts noted that her power at the company grew early this year as several top execs left, including COO Tom Rutledge and Marketing EVP Jonathan Hargis. (Both are now at Charter Communications.) BTIG analyst Rich Greenflield said in March that Jim Dolan decided to take control of operations because he blamed the old guard for allowing the company to lose ”both its technology and marketing edge.” Marketing is especially important for Cablevision. It faces stiff competition from Verizon FiOS in many of its systems in the tri-state area around New York. The company’s shares are down 7.7% over the last 12 months, a stark contrast to Time Warner Cable’s +43.7% and Charter’s +64.8%.







Kristin Dolan is promoting “Optimum” as a friendlier alternative to the Cablevision name. “Our new logo and branding campaign reflects our commitment to honesty, transparency, the quality of the services we provide and – importantly – how we interact with our customers,” she says. The 60 and 30-second “anthem” TV ads from Cablevision’s new branding agency, Mother NY, focus on customers “dealing with life’s incremental and highly personal challenges without having to worry about their Optimum-provided cable, phone or Internet service,” the company says.
Here’s the release about the marketing plans:

BETHPAGE, N.Y., SEPTEMBER 6, 2012 – Cablevision Systems Corp., (NYSE: CVC) today unveiled a new Optimum logo and the company’s first branding campaign in nearly 10 years, focused on customers and the meaningful connections enabled by the company’s Optimum products and technology.
The initial flight of television advertising will begin running in the New York metropolitan area tomorrow, and will continue for several weeks, followed by a second series of television spots expanding the campaign later in the year. The new logo and design program will be implemented across all customer-facing platforms and executions, including field service trucks, employee uniforms, Web properties, direct customer communications and, of course, marketing efforts.
“Cablevision, at its core, is a customer-focused company that provides essential services connecting each of our more than three million customers with their world,” said Kristin Dolan, Cablevision’s senior executive vice president of product management and marketing. “Our new logo and branding campaign reflects our commitment to honesty, transparency, the quality of the services we provide and – importantly – how we interact with our customers. We could not be more pleased or proud to be taking our marketing in this new direction, underscoring our leadership position in the markets we serve as the provider of the best TV, phone and Internet available anywhere, at any price.”
The logo, which will be used across all Optimum consumer-facing properties, is part of a new, overall redesign of the brand. It reflects a cleaner and much more simplified approach to design, unencumbered by extraneous visual elements. It was produced by COLLINS:, a New York-based firm run by Brian Collins, in cooperation with Cablevision’s internal marketing and product groups. Collins’ previous work includes design programs with Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Levi Strauss & Co., and Johnson & Johnson.
“Simplicity gets rid of the complicated and replaces it with clarity. We’ve worked with Optimum to deliver just that in their new design program. Frankly, as a designer, it’s been remarkable to work with a team of people who are so hell-bent on making every customer’s experience better and more meaningful,” Collins said. “This industry loves making things bigger and more complicated and more difficult to figure out. It takes a remarkable commitment – and focus – to move in the exact opposite direction and make things super easier and more meaningful for people. Optimum asked us to do just that when we began the redesign of their brand and, working in partnership with their amazing team I think we’ve done it.”
The television advertising, created by the company’s new branding agency, Mother NY, includes both 60 and 30-second “anthem” spots and a series of four 30-second spots focused on customers dealing with life’s incremental and highly personal challenges without having to worry about their Optimum-provided cable, phone or Internet service. Mother has most recently done extensive branding work with Virgin Mobile and Reading is Fundamental.
“We’re excited to help more people appreciate Optimum’s potency and for them to connect to the brand,” said Andrew Deitchman, Partner/co-Founder of Mother NY. “The last thing that people want to think about is their TV, phone and Internet. They just want them all to work. So our first campaign is about making Optimum’s services as simple, seamless, and straightforward as they can be.”
“We have been fortunate to collaborate with some of the most accomplished creative minds in branding and advertising, we have been energized by the process and are extremely proud of the work,” Dolan said. “To work with Brian Collins on the new Optimum logo, or a firm like Mother on communicating with the marketplace in a new way has been extremely gratifying, and we are excited to put our new design program and creative in front of both existing and prospective customers.”

Madison Square Garden and Cablevision chief James Dolan is splitting with his wife of 11 years, Kristin Dolan, Page Six has exclusively learned. Dolan — Cablevision president and CEO and MSG’s executive chairman — last night confirmed he and Kristin had amicably separated over the holidays. Kristin was promoted in November 2011 to Cablevision’s senior executive vice president of product management and marketing where she took a more prominent role at the company, heading two departments, after the departure of COO Tom Rutledge and other high-profile execs. Kristin, a 22-year Cablevision veteran with her own ambitious vision for the company, has set about turning its Optimum video, Internet and voice services into a more powerful consumer brand. Kristin met James — who controls the Knicks, the Rangers and the Rockettes — while working at Cablevision and the couple were married in 2002 at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach in front of a power crowd. Including his children from a previous marriage, the couple has six boys and the family lives on a sprawling estate in Oyster Bay, LI. Page Six understands there were no third parties involved in the breakup. Kristin and James Dolan said in a joint statement released to us last night: “We have been in a trial separation since the holidays. It is completely amicable and we ask that people respect our privacy at this time.”

Dolan Family Ventures Acquires Analytics Media Group and Launches 605 
      – A New Data and Analytics Company Specializing in Media and 
      Entertainment




Combines technology and analytics expertise of AMG with set-top box 
      data from partners to establish national independent audience 
      measurement and analytics business


Launches as fully-operational and financed company led by co-founders 
      Kristin Dolan as CEO and Ben Tatta as President






November 10, 2016 06:05 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dolan Family Ventures (DFV) announced today that it has acquired 
      Analytics Media Group (AMG), a leading data analytics and technology 
      business with deep political, marketing and analytics expertise, and 
      launched 605, a new independent audience measurement and analytics 
      business focused on optimizing marketing and programming initiatives 
      within the media and entertainment industries. 605 has expansive 
      relationships with partners across the country that provide extensive, 
      privacy-protected, set-top box viewing data to ensure that its analysis 
      is based on a vast and credible footprint of data representing key 
      individual and regional demographics.
    


      “Our experience in the industry tells us there are major gaps in 
      audience measurement and television analytics in the current marketing 
      and programming landscape,” said Kristin Dolan, founder and CEO of 605. 
      “The acquisition of AMG and the subsequent launch of 605 immediately 
      establishes a company with real scale, significant resources, profound 
      analytic capabilities, extensive set-top box data and management 
      experience. 605 is creating a new generation of products and services to 
      enhance media buying, planning, programming and audience targeting. This 
      fills a critical need for media and entertainment businesses in today’s 
      rapidly changing viewing landscape.”
    

      605 launches as a fully-formed and well-financed company to provide 
      solutions using data-driven, census-based audience measurement, 
      addressing some of the challenges in measurement that exist today. 605’s 
      set-top box data is unique in terms of its footprint and the rights 
      granted which enables a deeper, broader and more granular analysis to 
      deliver actionable insights to programmers, brands and advertisers.
    

      Ben Tatta, co-founder and President of 605, added, “As an early pioneer 
      in the use of set-top box data for TV measurement and ad optimization, 
      AMG has built one of the most advanced TV analytics businesses in the 
      United States. We look forward to working with the AMG team to integrate 
      data from our data partner’s set-top boxes to enhance and expand the 
      line-up of custom-tailored solutions that 605 will bring to programmers 
      and advertisers alike."
    

      “We have built a company that capitalizes on our deep expertise, 
      understanding of data and technology and ability to make our findings 
      valuable and actionable for our clients. This is a remarkable moment for 
      us – joining the 605 management team in leveraging the use of set-top 
      box data to bring new, more expansive solutions to market,” said 
      Chauncey McLean, founder and Chief Revenue Officer of AMG and now 
      Executive Vice President of Client Solutions at 605.
    

      AMG is a leading data analytics and technology business with strong 
      political, marketing and research expertise.
    

      “AMG is an outstanding partner whose pioneering use of data and powerful 
      insights have been of real value to Walmart,” said Aaron Bernstein, 
      Senior Director, Insights & Advocacy at Walmart. “We are really pleased 
      for the team there and excited about the formation of 605, which has the 
      potential to make AMG's solutions even stronger.”
    

      605 has a seasoned and experienced leadership team with a track-record 
      of innovation and success from Cablevision, prominent programming 
      companies and AMG, a leading data analytics and technology business with 
      deep roots in politics, brand marketing and consumer behavior research. 
      The leadership team consists of:
    


Kristin Dolan is founder and Chief Executive Officer of 605. 
        She most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of Cablevision 
        Systems Corporation, leading all aspects of the company’s cable 
        operations and overseeing thousands of employees, including the 
        company’s entire customer and field service workforce.
      

Ben Tatta is co-founder and President of 605. He most recently
