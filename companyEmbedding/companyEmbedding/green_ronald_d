You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Neogen Corp.

                    Founded in 1982, Neogen Corporation (NASDAQ: NEOG) has grown to more than 600 employees in multiple U.S. and international locations, and a worldwide presence. Neogen develops, manufactures and markets a diverse line of products dedicated to food and animal safety.

The Company’s Lansing, Mich.-based Food Safety Division develops and markets dehydrated culture media, and rapid diagnostic test kits to detect foodborne bacteria, spoilage organisms, mycotoxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, drug residues, plant diseases, and sanitation concerns. Neogen’s Lexington, Ky.-based Animal Safety Division develops and markets a complete line of diagnostics, veterinary instruments, veterinary pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements, disinfectants, and rodenticides. Neogen’s GeneSeek subsidiary based in Lincoln, Neb., is the leading global provider of DNA testing for animal agribusiness and veterinary medicine.

Neogen understands that its customers face serious consequences if their products are contaminated with any of a number of well-established or emerging threats, including dangerous bacteria, natural toxins, veterinary drug residues, unlabeled food allergens, rodent filth, sanitation concerns, broken veterinary needles or other contaminants. Neogen excels at helping to identify safety concerns in the vast and changing landscape of food and animal safety.

Neogen sales representatives can help customers address a wide array of concern with a “one-stop shop” approach that is a big advantage in a business climate trending toward single-source suppliers. The company now has more than 200 diagnostic tests to offer customers, and a comprehensive line of complementary products and services, such as dehydrated culture media to go with unmatched customer support and training. Neogen employs a similar marketing strategy for its veterinary products, offering customers a wide variety of animal safety solutions.

Neogen believes that maintaining earned trust is a combination of innovation and a continuous commitment to quality. Neogen’s quality management system is ISO 9001 certified, which communicates to the company’s worldwide customer base that it understands the quality standards customers expect, and is firmly committed to achieving those quality standards.
