Construction and Lease-Up











 





Construction & Lease-Up
Timely completion of construction is key to ensuring the delivery of projected tax credits. The general partner is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the project is constructed or rehabilitated and placed in service in accordance with the timelines and basis amounts set forth in the limited partnership agreement (LPA) and associated projections. Enterprise Community Asset Management monitors progress through reports received during construction and is available for consultation as needed. When construction is complete, Enterprise reviews the cost certification, 8609s and other key documentation prior to finalization.
Processing Capital Requests
As each operating partnership submits its required capital payment draw request, Enterprise reviews the package to ensure it is complete and has appropriate support, that sources and uses are reasonable and that construction progress is proceeding as expected. Information generally provided in a draw request package includes the following:
AIA forms (G702-703)
Lien waiver from the general contractor
A calculation of projected and actual completion
Independent inspection report
Soft cost invoices (for all amounts over $10,000 unless otherwise required by the Investor)
Unified draw schedule showing sources and uses, amounts funded to date by each funder, and amount of the requested draw to be funded by each funder
Other items as required per the LPA
Cost Certification
The cost certification report should be completed by an independent Certified Public Accountant which details total development costs and eligible basis. It is used by the allocating state agency to determine the amount of credits that will be reflected on the Form 8609. Enterprise reviews the draft certifications prior to submission to the state agency. The following information should be included:
Total project costs
Detail of permanent sources to equal total project costs
Calculation of eligible basis for acquisition, new/rehabilitation, historic tax credits, state credits and energy credits (if applicable)
Calculation of credits by credit type
If financed by tax exempt bonds, the 50-percent test must be included
8609s
Once the cost certification report has been approved and the allocating state agency issued Form 8609(s) have been received (signed by the state agency), Enterprise Community Asset Management reviews the full 8609 (including the completed part II) prior to filing with the IRS. Any errors in the completion of the Form 8609(s) are difficult, costly and time consuming to correct and could have a serious impact on the project’s achievement of tax credits. Therefore, it is essential that all parties are in agreement on the cost certification report, application and completion of the 8609s to avoid any issues.
Lease-Up
The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that tenants in tax credit units meet certain income eligibility requirements. A tenant’s income must be certified and verified prior to signing a lease for tax credit units. In order to facilitate the lease up process, ensure tax credit compliance and confirm unit qualification dates, Enterprise requires copies of the initial tenant files for every unit in the project. In addition, Enterprise requires the Unit Tracking Sheet be submitted on a monthly basis throughout the lease‐up process.
Since the initial tenant files for a property are of critical importance, we strongly recommend that General Partners store copies of the initial files off‐site, as well. Listed below is the link to the state agency website which will have information you will need in regards to compliance in your state. We strongly recommend that you go to the state website to be sure that you are using the most recent compliance manuals, forms, income and rent limits and subscribe to updates, newsletters, etc.
 Complete, initial tenant files should include the following:
TIC (Tenant Income Certification)
Application
Interview Checklist/Questionnaire
Student Status Affidavit
Under $5k Asset Cert (if applicable)
No Asset or Asset Disposed of Form
Income & Asset Worksheet showing how you calculated the household’s income
Sources of Income Verifications
Sources of Assets Verifications ‐
Non Employment Affidavit or Cert of Zero Income (if applicable)
Child Support Verifications/Statements (if applicable)
Child Support Documentation (court orders, etc.)
Lease Agreement
Lease Addendum (if applicable)
Also, please include one copy of the following documents:
Blank lease
Blank Application
Income Limits (current and prior year)
Rent Limits (current and prior year)
Utility Allowance (current and prior year, if applicable)
Rent Roll
Additional Recommendations for Acquisition/Rehab Properties that had a prior LIHTC Allocation:
The TIC and paperwork that originally qualified the unit under the prior Extended Use Agreement (EUA) should be included in the initial tenant file for the new LIHTC allocation.
If the property is mixed‐income, the most recent recertification paperwork should be copied and placed in the initial tenant file.
Residents should complete a certification (within 120 days of acquisition or within 120 days of the credit delivery period) stating household composition and student status.

For instance, if the so-called Buffett Rule passes, capital gains taxes would increase from 15% to 30% for those with incomes above $250,000 or  those with a $1 million in hard assets. Another looming tax hike are the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire in 2013, pushing rates up for many Americans.While these two tax alterations are not set in stone, one sure thing to consider is that the estate tax will be returning to 55% (from the current rates of 35%), and the amount you can exclude from your estate for tax purposes will be reduced from $5.12 million to the 2003 rate of $1 million. When a valuable inheritance is rich in land but light in cash, paying more than half your inheritance is a greater burden, especially if you have to sell the property to pay the taxes.If you are a business owner, you must plan ahead for any of these potential tax eventualities. The Buffett Rule may never transpire, but estate taxes will not go away, and there’s a good chance that the Bush tax cuts will expire or be altered.But how do you plan for changes in the tax code that have not happened yet – or might not happen at all? It’s simple: Focus on financial instruments and entities that will allow you to protect your assets and mitigate changes in the tax code. If you have a business that involves family members, or a business or assets that you want to leave to your family, then one such entity is the family limited partnership (FLP).What Is a Family Limited Partnership?A family limited partnership is a partnership agreement that exists between family members who are actively involved in a trade or business. The partnership divides rights to income, appreciation, and control among the family members, according to the family’s overall objectives.The family “business” does not actually have to be a business in the traditional sense – assets such as real estate or investments can also be in a FLP, as can the family farm, ranch, or real estate holdings. The nature of the FLP allows you to shift the value of assets to other members, thereby reducing the size of the estate for certain members.A family, as defined for tax purposes, only includes a person’s spouse, children, ancestors (including parents), lineal descendants (grandchildren), and any other trusts established for the benefit of those people. So, for example, a newly married spouse could be part of the partnership, but not a second cousin.The most common way of setting up an FLP is to create a general partnership first with limited partnership interests. The general partner (or partners) then gift the limited partnership interest to the children or other family members who are eligible. Whomever holds the general partner title maintains control over the enterprise or assets, but the limited partnership interest lets children or other eligible family memberships share in the ownership.This is probably where the concept of not mixing family with business originated. Business interests are ripe for family conflict. So why would anyone create an FLP and risk family strife?Advantages of FLPs1. Estate Planning Is Simple and Estate Tax Savings Are Substantial The FLP is a frequently-used technique to shift income tax burdens from parents to children as an estate planning tool. The interests transferred to your children, including all appreciation since the transfer, escape inclusion in your estate when you die. Only the value of the taxable gifts at the time they were transferred into the FLP are included for purposes of estate taxes.For example, if the value of the partner interests are valued at $500,000, but in 20 years rise to a value of $5 million, only the $500,000 amount would be included in the estate for the purposes of estate planning. This can lead to estate tax savings down the road.2. Transferring of Ownership Is Systematic If a business is a sole proprietorship at the death of the owner, the value of the business is included in the value of the estate. If it is set up as a corporation, again, the value of the shares of the corporation is fully in the value of the estate.An FLP, however, allows the owner to set up family members as limited partners, and allow them to transfer partnership interests over time. This results in a gradual, systematic transfer of ownership. The value of the partnership interests is not included in the value of the estate of the general partner when he dies.3. There Are Significant Income Tax Benefits Aside from the estate planning advantages, the family limited partnership can lead to substantial income tax savings. By including your children as partners and sharing partnership income with them, total family taxes may be reduced because your children, as limited partners, own part of the company.For example, most small businesses in the country are set up as sub-chapter S corporations. This setup allows owners to take the profits of the corporation and pass them on as personal income to the owners – and this is the reason many in Congress oppose higher taxes on the $250,000 per year income threshold. If, however, you choose to set up an FLP, the general partner can share the income with his two kids. He may pay each $75,000, reducing his income for tax purposes to $150,000, not $250,000.There is, however, an important caveat here: You cannot shift income to children younger than 14. In the old days, this was a favored tactic of the rich and infamous. Rich fathers and uncles would put the five-year old on the payroll and pay him $2 million. That is a no-no in today’s world. For any child younger than 14, any income over $1,600 will be taxed at the top marginal rate of his parents.Disadvantages of FLPs1. Children May Be Exposed to Major Capital Gains Liability Gifted property does not receive the stepped-up basis treatment that bequeathed property receives. The term “stepped-up” refers to the value of an asset when a person dies and leaves the asset to an heir. For example, an uncle buys 1,000 shares of Apple stock when it is only $50 per share. He dies, and leaves it to his favorite niece. The value of the Apple stock, and what the niece gains or loses, is based on the market price on the day she took ownership, not the price the uncle paid. This is important, because if it were based on the latter amount, her capital gains liability would be steep.In an FLP, however, this may not be the case, and children may be exposed to significant capital gains liability. This varies, depending on the type of property being transferred and what has happened to it. It’s always best to discuss with an attorney potential capital gains issues – and it’s always important to remember that property in an FLP does not have the same stepped-up value basis as property left to heirs.2. General Partners Could Be at Risk Unlike corporations and trusts, general partners are not insulated from potential lawsuits, judgments, or creditor seizures. The parents, as general partners, are 100% in control of the assets and 100% responsible for a potential lawsuit. General partners have no asset protection in these cases.3. It Can Be Difficult to Transfer Ownership to Children Under 18 FLPs are not the best entity for transferring assets or business interest to family members who are under the age of 18. First of all,  the minor’s interest would have to be held by a parent or guardian. Second, partners must be able to play a role in the day-to-day management and operations of the business. This also makes partnership interest unsuitable for family members who are older than 18 but are away in college.4. Non-business Assets Could Become Large Tax Liabilities If the FLP you have or will create is for the sole purpose of non-business assets, such as real estate or investment securities, then you must be careful – you could find the FLP to be considered an investment company. This may cause capital gains and, therefore, losses realized on the transfer of property into the partnership.For instance, a beach house owned by a grandfather and grandmother increases in value from $50,000 to $2 million. If the FLP is labeled as an investment company, then transferring ownership of the beach house to the FLP could create a capital gain of just under $2 million, and a tax bill of approximately $300,000 dollars. If you only have one type of property, then other type of trusts are better suited to avoid large tax liabilities.Final WordThe scenario just described is not one that normally happens under partnership rules, but it can. Despite that, the benefits of the family limited partnership can be significant – but only if set up correctly.When dealing with any type of estate planning strategy, using an attorney in conjunction with a financial advisor is a must. Speak with more than one. FLPs are the favorite of attorneys, while investment professionals and CPAs sometimes like to use other estate planning tools such as trusts, limited liability companies, or partnerships. Setting up an FLP can cost anywhere between $5,000 to $10,000 dollars with ongoing costs after setup. Given the costs, getting a second or even third opinion in this area is a smart move, worth the extra effort and time.(photo credit: Bigstock)Related26.8K Views10 SharesFacebookTweetPinLinkedInKiara AshantiKiara Ashanti is a former financial advisor, securities trader, and writer in Central Florida.

Stifel Select List Energy MLPs to Buy for 2017

With everybody returning to Wall Street from the holidays, the focus is now squarely on 2017 and what makes sense. One thing that looks solid is the prospects for oil. While the halcyon days of 2014 and $100 a barrel should stay in the rear-view mirror, the prospects for a stay between $50 and $60 this year look good, and that bodes well for many producers, especially those out in the Permian and other top onshore shale areas.
A recent research report from Stifel is cautiously optimistic on the prospects for 2017, and the firm also feels that energy master limited partnership (MLP) yields are very favorable compared to other equity income classes like utilities. The report said in its overview” 


The operating environment in general as domestic production stabilizes with a Healthier E&P customer appears to be the most noteworthy and positive trend For energy infrastructure. The specter of rising interests may challenge performance. Although our analysis minimizes our concerns. Cost of capital will continue to be a Focal point given the industry’s dependence on external funding and perpetual equity Issuance. Assets exposed to the NGL barrel, particularly ethane and LPG exports, should reap benefits in 2017.
These six companies made the Stifel Select List, and all are rated Buy.
Enterprise Products Partners
This is one of the largest publicly traded partnerships and a leading North American provider of midstream energy services to producers and consumers. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD) once again, despite the energy slump, recently raised its distribution 1%. The company maintains a very good long-term position in the market. It provides many of its services on the basis of long-term, fixed-fee contracts, insulating against some of the wilder swings of the commodities that it trades in.
One reason why many analysts may like the stock might be its distribution coverage ratio. The company’s distribution coverage ratio is well above one times, making it a relatively less risky MLP. Its distributions have grown for several quarters, and last quarter Enterprise Products announced that the board of directors of its general partner declared an increase in the quarterly cash distribution paid to partners to $0.405 per common unit, or $1.62 per unit on an annualized basis.
Investors receive a 6.0% distribution. The Stifel price target for the stock is $32, and the Wall Street consensus target is $31.88. Shares closed last Friday at $27.04.

Cone Midstream Partners
This company has had a great run off the lows last February but is still down from highs posted in 2014. Cone Midstream Partners L.P. (NYSE: CNNX) is a growth-oriented MLP recently formed by CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy to own, operate, develop and acquire natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets to service its sponsors’ production in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
The company’s assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. Its gathering assets comprise a network of 244 miles of gathering pipelines with an average daily throughput of approximately 1,099 Bcfe/d and 15 compression and dehydration facilities. It also operates two condensate-handling facilities with handling capacities of 2,500 Bbl/d each in Majorsville, Pennsylvania, and Moundsville, West Virginia, that provide condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization services. It also operates other partnership assets.
Unitholders receive a 5.64% distribution. Stifel has a $26 price target. The consensus figure is $23.90. Shares closed last Friday at $23.55.
