Highpower International with Portable Energy Storage Products will Appear in Munich, Germany Again








        Highpower Makes Its First Large Scale Entrance Into Chinese Electric Vehicle (EV) Market With an Order for Large Format Lithium Polymer Batteries
      

        Release date: 2014-02-25
      

        Batteries to Be Used in Electric Buses
      

        SAN FRANCISCO, CA and SHENZHEN, CHINA--(Marketwired - February 25, 2014) - Highpower International, Inc. (NASDAQ: HPJ), a developer, manufacturer, and marketer of nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) and lithium rechargeable batteries, and a battery management solution and recycling provider, today announced that the company has received its first-ever order for large format lithium batteries to be used in electric buses from Huizhou Yipeng Energy Technology Ltd. ('Huizhou Yipeng'), a system integrator serving various large bus manufactures throughout China. This order marks Highpower's first large scale entrance into the EV segment.
      

        Highpower will deliver to Huizhou Yipeng two formats of product including16 ampere hour and 20 ampere hour NCM [Li(NiCoMn)O2] lithium polymer batteries that have passed the quality test from China National Quality Center (CNQC) and Huizhou Yipeng. These batteries will be used in some of China's well-known brands of hybrid electric buses and plug-in hybrid electric buses. It is estimated that each hybrid electric bus will be using 96 of 16-ampere-hour battery while each plug-in hybrid electric bus will use 288 of 20-ampere-hour battery. Highpower expects sales to Huizhou Yipeng will range between $4 million and $5 million during fiscal year 2014.
      

        Mr. George Pan, Chairman and CEO of Highpower International, commented, 'This order represents a significant milestone for Highpower, as we now have expanded our target market from the traditional consumer electronics market into the rapidly growing electric vehicles segment. We are also pleased to have teamed up with a great customer in the EV market. The founder of Huizhou Yipeng, who worked for the Ministry of Transportation for many years, has not only accumulated deep knowledge and understanding of the national EV policy, but is also extremely resourceful in the EV industry. Many key members of Huizhou Yipeng's technical team, most notably in its battery management system (BMS), have years of prior R&D and business development experiences with global auto companies such as General Motor, Ford, Eaton Corp and ZF. By collaborating with Huizhou Yipeng, we expect to fast track our penetration into the EV market.'
      

        Mr. Pan continued, 'In 2008 and 2010, we supplied a small test quantity of rechargeable lithium polymer batteries to be used on some electric buses for the Beijing Olympic Games and the Shanghai World Expo. Building on this experience, over the past few years we have strengthened our R&D efforts in battery technology and new material, accumulated extensive technical know-how, and improved production capabilities on rechargeable lithium batteries. In conjunction with the ramping up of our new lithium battery factory in Huizhou, we believe now is the appropriate time for us to evolve, penetrate and capitalize on the electric transportation space and meet tremendous demand for advanced lithium battery products from the fast-emerging EV market. The Chinese Government is highly committed to the EV market with the 'Energy Saving and New Energy Car Industry Development Plan' aiming to increase annual production of pure EV and plug-in hybrid EVs to 500,000 by 2015 and over 5 million by 2020.'
      

        'We are confident that Highpower is on the right track to diversify our rechargeable battery businesses from not only consumer electronics but also to the electrical transportation and industrial energy storage markets, ultimately becoming a global leader in every aspect of rechargeable battery applications, including recycling, processing and reusing,' concluded Mr. Pan.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
