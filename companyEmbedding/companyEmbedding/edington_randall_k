This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Randall K. Edington
						


Randall K. "Randy" Edington is executive vice president-nuclear and chief nuclear officer for Arizona Public Service Company. Edington joined APS in January 2007 and he is responsible for all nuclear-related activities associated with the three-unit Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station â the largest nuclear station in the nation.
Prior to arriving at APS, Edington served as vice president and chief nuclear officer for Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD). His responsibilities included oversight and directional focus of the Cooper Nuclear Station on behalf of NPPD in conjunction with an Entergy
Corporation management contract.
Edington began his nuclear industry career in the Navy's nuclear submarine program, where he served for eight years. He began his commercial nuclear career at Arkansas Nuclear One in 1981. During his tenure at ANO, Edington obtained reactor operator and senior reactor operator licenses and held numerous positions including non-licensed operator, shift manager, outage manager, operations manager, plant manager, and finally site general manager.  He was transferred to Entergy's River Bend Station in Louisiana in 1998 as site vice president.  Upon Entergy's acquisition of Indian Point 2 in 2001, Edington was dispatched there to deal with emergent issues in the Operations Training program. He later became Entergy North vice president of support / training, assigned to corporate offices supporting Indian Point Units 2 and 3, Fitzpatrick Station in New York, Pilgrim Station in Massachusetts, and Vermont Yankee Nuclear Station.
Edington obtained a bachelor's degree in physical science (nuclear physics option) from Arkansas Technical University and a master's degree in operations management from the University of Arkansas.
Edington serves as the chairman of the Executive Advisory Group (EAG) of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. He is also a member of the INPO Future of Learning Strategy Board, and is a frequent presenter at INPO leadership seminars. Edington chairs the Workforce Working Group of the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and is a member of the NEI Nuclear Strategic Issues Advisory Committee Steering group. He is also a member of the Executive Management Group of the PWR Owners Group.
