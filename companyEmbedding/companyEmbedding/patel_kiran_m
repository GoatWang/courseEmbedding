Biography 

Dr. Kiran Patel
Kiran Patel was born in Zambia, Africa to Asian-Indian 
                            parents. He was educated under the British Educational 
                            System in Zambia and then got his diploma in Cambridge 
                            University and The University of London. He came down 
                            to India to study medicine in Gujarat University in 
                            India and did his Internship in Africa. Dr. Patel 
                            did his residency in Internal Medicine in New Jersey 
                            in 1980. He completed a fellowship in the Cardiology 
                            program affiliated with the Columbia University of 
                            New York in 1982.

                            Dr. Kiran moved to Tampa, Florida in 1982 and began 
                            his practice in Cardiology. He was very successful 
                            and became a distinguished cardiologist in that area. 
                            He developed a physician practice management company 
                            and expanded to places adjoining Tampa Bay area diverging 
                            into 14 practices including Family Medicine, Internal 
                            Medicine, Pediatrics and Cardiology.

                            Kiran was also in partnership with a lot of point-of-service 
                            locations to form multi-specialty network. This network 
                            helped patients to access most medical services conveniently. 
                            He has actively engaged himself in managed care contracts 
                            and has expanded so much that it provides care for 
                            more than 80,000 patients. Apart from this he has 
                            developed good associations with several HMOs and 
                            hospitals. His success in managed care contracts led 
                            a group of doctors to seek his services to help them 
                            with an HMO in New Port Richey, Florida. 

Dr. Patel took up the project after discussing 
                            a pre-determined purchase option of the company. It 
                            was called the Well Care HMO, Inc. (Well Care). 
                            In 1992, Dr. Kiran Patel, along with Rupesh Shaw, 
                            CEO, and Pradip Patel, President, started a Medicaid 
                            managed care company. This company became the largest 
                            Medicaid provider in the state of Florida.
                            He helped to bring around the struggling HMO, WellCare 
                            of New York and Connecticut.
                            He worked with more than 95 hospitals and a few hundred 
                            physicians in settling past due medical claims. Dr. 
                            Kiran Patel provided an additional $15 million in 
                            equity through Conversion of Brow and infused $10 
                            million of new capital and acquired 55 percent of 
                            the publicly held Well Care Management Group. 
Between 1995 and 2002, Dr. Kiran Patel built it 
                            into a billion-dollar company, providing services 
                            to more than 450,000 members, employing more than 
                            1,200 employees and operating in Florida, New York 
                            and Connecticut.

                            He is presently serving as Chairman of Visionary Medical 
                            Systems. He believes that the Visionary Office will 
                            reduce the paperwork for the physicians and give them 
                            more time to devote on their patients. He is a member 
                            on the following organizations: Fellow of American 
                            College of Cardiology; American Medical Association, 
                            American College of Physicians, American Association
