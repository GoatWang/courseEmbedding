NEW ARRIVALS!









Lymphatic Skin Brushes/Eye Pillows/Hot & Cold Therapy Pillows





Renewal Products was founded in 1991 on our line of 4 coconut fiber Lymphatic Dry Skin Brushes.  We quickly expanded our product line to include eye pillows, hot/cold therapy pillows, buckwheat support pillows and agave fiber products.
In 1991, our skin brushes fulfilled a need in the marketplace for a stiff bristled natural fiber lymphatic brush.  Why is a stiff bristle important?  With a stiffer bristle, the lymphatic system will move toxins and assist the body’s own natural detoxification process.  To learn more, visit: http://renewalproducts.com/lymphatic-dry-skin-brushes/
Our pillow products are all produced in Colorado and include lavender scented (from essential oil) and unscented Eye Pillows and Neck Wraps. We also offer a eucalyptus scented (from essential oil) Sinus Pillow,  two unscented Hot/Cold Therapy Pillows and two Buckwheat Hull Support Pillows.  We use premium cotton fabrics and pillows are filled with natural product, either unhulled millet, corn or buckwheat hulls.
Our bath items include a unique, sculpted pumice stone and several agave fiber items. Agave fiber is a true gift from Mother Nature!  To complete the line, we also offer a Backscratcher made from bamboo, a renewable resource.

        Awesome product!
I Never do reviews like never, but I had to after taking the critical care 50 billion. How I found out about this product? I was surfing the Internet.  So after my hours of research, It all was leading to probotics,so I figured I would try some but, which one? I ran into a website listing the top 10 probotics, I still didn't know which of the 10 to choose from so I started reading reviews on them, and the critical care had the most positive reviews.  Thank you for this product it's amazing life changing and a miracle worker!!.

        I feel great
I recently started using your Ultimate Flora Critical Care probiotic strains in the 50 billion cultures per capsule and immediately noticed a tremendous difference in the way I feel! After several years of dealing with digestive problems I finally decided to give probiotics a try. Your product is the ONLY one that has helped me maintain a noticeable digestive balance. I feel great and can't thank you enough for producing a superior product. .

        Amazing!!!!
I have been taking this probiotic for 6 years now and have had amazing changes in my health. 6 years ago I started taking things into my own hands and I researched gut health and the health problems that are a result of poor support in the digestive system. I started cleaning up my diet and taking these amazing little probiotics. I would encourage anyone to take this product it is the best out there that I have found. This has been the one thing that has been the most beneficial to me. Thank you Renew Life!.

        NOT effective
As the owner of a health food store, I have guided countless towards these probiotics because they worked. Over the past two years I find they are NOT as effective. Has anyone else noticed this?

Hopefully more customers will contact you and demand the quality product you once provided over two years ago.

        Amazing
I had heard about this product on public television and wondered if it was just for older people or people with chronic issues. I wondered if this could possibly work.  I can't even begin to tell of the difference this product has made. My gut was restored and as long as my diet stays pretty consistent I feel great..

        SECOND TO NONE
With so many probiotic products it is hard to find the right one. I have my family on this product and we have all notice benefits since we have begun taking this product. My family history has come with a lot of GI issues that I inherited myself. Since taking this product I have felt less irritated. Great buy!!! You can not go wrong with this!.

About Renew Life



Digestive Wellness, Naturally—Since 1997

At Renew Life™, we believe a healthy gut is a happy gut. For nearly two decades, we have been empowering people to elevate their quality of life through better digestive health. Our natural products are formulated to support digestive and total-body wellness.* They include high-potency probiotics, fiber, digestive aids, enzymes, and internal cleanses. Plus our flagship brand—Ultimate Flora™ Probiotics—is the #1 selling probiotic brand in health food stores nationwide.†
Renew Life products are made with superior-quality ingredients to help you achieve optimal health from the inside out.* We go the extra mile in ensuring the ingredients are protected and precisely delivered within the body to optimize potency and absorption.* Perhaps as important as the ingredients that are in our products are the ingredients that are not in our products. To keep you smiling, we are committed to providing natural supplements with no artificial ingredients, colors, preservatives, or other unnecessary materials of any kind.
All Renew Life digestive care supplements are guaranteed for quality, purity, and potency through expiration, and are formulated to help you achieve digestive wellness, naturally.*
†Ultimate Flora #1 Probiotic Brand in Natural Channel based on unit sales, SPINS Natural Channel data 52 weeks ending 10/04/15.
