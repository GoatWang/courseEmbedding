Aggregate Information
		If you are a Registered User, in connection with your visit to the Site, we may automatically collect Site usage information ("Usage Data").  The Usage Data gathered includes when and how often you access the Site, browser information and the computer terminal from which you accessed the Site.  Usage Data generally is collected through the use of cookies as discussed below. 
		
Cookies
		We use "cookies" to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site.  A "cookie" is a small file or tool stored on the User's hard drive containing information that allows us to deliver customized information to you.  If you register as a Registered User, we may use cookies to store your e-mail address, user name, preferences and password so we can identify you when you return to the Site, and track your use of the Site. You may set your browser to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies; however, certain features of the Site may not function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies. 
		
		Moon Capital uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on the Site. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable, and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.

We may retain your email for a period of time, but will not use any of your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than responding to your email.

You can always opt-out of receiving these communications from us by following the "opt-out" procedures described below.

Except for information collected identifying the specific computer terminal from which you accessed the Site, this data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. If you are a Registered User, we may also use your Usage Data to determine your compliance with our Terms of Use.

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing  a customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As stated above, we do not share such Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. California Users may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing investorrelations@mooncapital.com.

The Registered User and its Authorized Users may access and use the Moonweb Client Site solely for purposes of obtaining information related to the Registered User's or its clients' investments in investment funds managed by Moon Capital and solely in accordance with the Terms.

The Registered User agrees not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, exploit or make any commercial use of, nor permit anyone other than Authorized Users to access the Moonweb Client Site, Content or the Custom Reports, and in no event, whether or not commercial in nature, shall the Registered User make any use of the Content or Custom Reports for the benefit of any third party.  No third party shall be entitled to obtain direct or indirect access to the Moonweb Client Site, any Content or any Custom Reports unless and until they have entered into their own agreements with Moon Capital to obtain and govern such access.
			14.	INDEMNIFICATION.
			The Registered User will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Moon Capital, its parents, subsidiaries, members, partners, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns, from all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), arising out of (a) any breach of the Terms by the Registered User or its Authorized Users, or (b) the negligence or willful misconduct of the Registered User or its Authorized Users.  
			15.	TERMINATION AND EFFECT.
			(a)	Each of the Registered User and Moon Capital may terminate the Terms at any time for any reason, on written notice to the other party.

			(c)	Upon termination of this Agreement, the Registered User's right to use the Moonweb Client Site and any Content shall immediately cease.  Sections 9 through 14, 21, 22, 23 and 26 shall survive any termination or expiration of the Terms.

Any notice or other communication to be made hereunder, even if otherwise required to be in writing under other provisions of the Terms, may alternatively be made in an electronic record transmitted electronically to the email addresses set forth (a) in the case of Moon Capital, below, or (b) in the case of the Registered User, in its Registered User Information provided in accordance with Section 4 above.  Any notice or other communication made in electronic form will have the same legal effect and enforceability as if made in non-electronic form.  Moon Capital may also broadcast notices or messages on this Moonweb Client Site, or other matters of importance; such broadcasts shall constitute notice to the Registered User.  
			20.	ASSIGNMENT.
			The Registered User shall not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms, in whole or in part, or delegate or subcontract any of its rights or obligations hereunder.  Any attempted transfer or delegation by the Registered User without Moon Capital's consent will be void.  The Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns.

			23.	THIRD PARTIES.
			The Terms shall confer no rights upon any other party other than the parties hereto.
			24.	PARTIAL INVALIDITY.
			The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more provisions of the Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of its remaining provisions.
			25.	SECTION HEADINGS.
