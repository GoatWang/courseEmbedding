Bennett, Michael L.
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Carolina:













Does Bennett Michael L carry a valid contracting license?



In North Carolina a construction project with costs of $30,000 or more requires a contractor to be licensed.
Bennett Michael L currently holds license 14567 (Residential), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Bennett Michael L



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Bennett Michael L



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Bennett Michael L



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
