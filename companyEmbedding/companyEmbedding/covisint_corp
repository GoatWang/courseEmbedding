            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

The Cloud Platform for a Secure, Connected World.
Changing the world one connection at a time.

The beginning.
In the 90’s – the enterprise was changing.
The main drivers behind this change were an increasing pervasive nature of technology, open standards, globalization, and the increasing fusion of business models and IT capability.
Increased collaboration brought greater business rewards, but also posed greater business risks, and required fundamentally new business decision and security models.
And, de-constructing.
Enterprises were de-constructing and reorganizing into extended value-nets of partners, suppliers, customers, and competitors to increase productivity and flexibility—shedding non-core processes to focus on strategic, core processes.
With re-aggregation.
As businesses evolved along the line of de-construction of their business, the demand to flexibly assemble and reconfigure business systems as business needs evolved – they re-aggregated.












The stage is set.
As some components or services were moved out of the business the possibility to re-aggregate them to support dynamic and changing business models increased.
The market was increasingly adapting to a strategy along which to do this. The concept of this kind of re-aggregation or integration was well reflected in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) strategy. SOA is an approach to defining integration architectures based on the concept of a service.
In the beginning there were three.
Plus, some extra wise men.




An idea was born.
Covisint (KO-vis-int)
United States Patent: 7,987,116
…
3. An industry-wide business-to-business exchange system comprising: a first subsystem configured to provide user access to the exchange system; and a second subsystem configured to perform the steps of: providing an interface configured to couple a system of each of a plurality of customers to the exchange system; allowing management of authorized users to access data residing in the system of a respective customer by an entity other than the respective customer; authenticating an individual user; and responsive to a result of the authenticating step indicating that the individual user is an authorized user, authorizing the individual user to access data residing in the exchange system and data residing in the system of one of a plurality of customers of the exchange system, wherein the system of each of the plurality of customers of the exchange system is coupled to the exchange system via a data communication network.
4. The system of claim 3, wherein the exchange system allows the individual user to access data residing in the exchange system and data residing in one of the plurality of customers of the exchange system with a single identity authentication step.
Covisint will offer a comprehensive foundation for B2B transformation.

Where are we now?
Well, enterprises continue to de-construct and re-aggregate – and we can help them all. But, there has been an explosion in devices, machines and things that need be included in the mix now.
The world is becoming more connected every day. Billions and billions of people and things are connecting, sharing and innovating. The transformations and advancements being driven from these connections are breath taking; eclipsed only by the rate at which they are taking place.
Covisint sits squarely in the middle of this new highly connected world.
Covisint is the cloud platform of choice for enabling Internet of Things and identity-centric solutions – securely and at scale. We allow developers, partners and customers to innovate and drive digital transformation faster with less cost, complexity and risk. We provide secure and seamless connections between people, processes, systems, and things for global enterprises.
Our next generation IoT vision and platform will change the world and create unprecedented value by securely connecting the unconnected in ways never thought possible.

Merit Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS)
On October 14, 2016, CMS finalized MACRA’s new Medicare Quality Payment Program (QPP) rules. Here are some of the highlights:

Clinicians can choose to report to MIPS for a full 90-day period or, ideally, the full year, and maximize the MIPS eligible clinician’s chances to qualify for a positive payment adjustment.
Clinicians can choose to report MIPS for at least a full 90-day period and report: (a) more than one quality measure, and (b) more than one improvement activity, and (c) more than the required measures in the advancing care information performance category and avoid a negative MIPS payment adjustment and possibly receive a positive MIPS payment adjustment.
Clinicians can choose to report one measure in the quality performance category; one activity in the improvement activities performance category; or report the required measures of the advancing care information performance category and avoid a negative MIPS payment adjustment. Alternatively, if MIPS eligible clinicians choose to not report even one measure or activity, they will receive the full negative 4 percent adjustment.
MIPS eligible clinicians can participate in Advanced APMs.

For 2017, many small practices will be excluded from new requirements due to the low volume threshold, which has been set at less than or equal to $30,000 in Medicare Part B allowed charges or less than or equal to 100 Medicare patients.
For full participation in the Quality Performance category, clinicians will report on six quality measures including at least one Outcome or High Priority measure if an outcome measure is not available, or one specialty specific or subspecialty specific measure set. Under the 2017 transition year, for the quality category, clinicians who submit at least one out of six quality measures will meet the MIPS performance threshold of 3 points – enough to avoid a negative payment adjustment.
Individual MIPS eligible clinicians or groups submitting data on quality measures using qualified registries must report on at least 50 percent of the MIPS eligible clinician or group’s patients that meet the measure’s denominator criteria, regardless of payer for the performance period. In other words, CMS expects to receive quality data for both Medicare and non-Medicare patients. For the transition year, MIPS eligible clinicians whose measures fall below the data completeness threshold of 50 percent would receive 3 points for submitting the measure.
If fewer than six measures apply to the individual MIPS eligible clinician or group, then the MIPS eligible clinician or group would be required to report on each measure that is applicable. CMS defines “applicable” to mean measures relevant to a particular MIPS eligible clinician’s services or care rendered. The MIPS validation process will vary by submission mechanism. For claims and registry submissions, CMS plans to use the cluster algorithms from the current MAV process under PQRS to identify which measures an MIPS eligible clinician is able to report.
For the 2017 transition year, if the measure is submitted but is unable to be scored because it does not meet the required case minimum (20), does not have a benchmark, or does not meet the data completeness requirement (at least 50% reporting rate), the measure will receive a score of 3 points. Measures that were submitted or calculated that met the following criteria will receive 3 to 10 points based on performance compare to the benchmark.

The measure has a benchmark
Has at least 20 cases; and
Meets the data completeness standard (generally 50 percent)

Submission of the Advancing Care Information performance category or the Improvement Activities category can be done via the Covisint registry. Look for these reporting options to be available within the Covisint web application in future releases.
For full participation in the Advancing Care Information performance category, MIPS eligible clinicians will report on five required base score measures. For more click on the Advancing Care Information Fact Sheet under the documents tab.
For full participation in the Improvement Activities performance category, clinicians can engage in 3 combinations of activities based on weight to earn the highest possible score of 40. For more on the Improvement Activities refer to the fact sheet under the documents tab.

Virtual Measures Group Forms
Covisint Virtual Measures Groups
Additional measures groups will be available in the coming weeks.
CMS’ final rule for MACRA’s Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) allows for Eligible Clinician’s to “pick your pace” by reporting a minimal amount of data to avoid penalty OR report more data for a 90-day period for the possibility of earning a small positive payment adjustment. With this in mind, and understanding that not all clinicians have adopted an EMR, Covisint has created these easy to use forms giving you the option to report “some data” using a BASIC measure set thus avoiding penalty or choose to report the ADVANCED measure set designed to aid in maximizing scoring*. In either case refer to the Individual Measure specifications for measure requirement criteria.
*To maximize potential incentives Eligible Clinicians must report at least six (6) quality measures including an Outcome or High Priority measure at a 50% reporting rate for at least 90-days in addition to other MIPS requirements.

Covisint Enterprise Analysis Service
For organizations that need assistance aggregating their Quality Measure data Covisint offers an analysis service. The Covisint MIPS Enterprise service allows organizations to report MIPS Quality Measures as either individual eligible clinicians or as a group (GPRO) with data aggregated across the group TIN. By extracting your billing and clinical data from your source systems and uploading to Covisint via a secure file transport system Covisint can then analyze the data identifying measure eligible encounters and performance.
Results are provided via reports through a secure portal where they can be viewed and downloaded on demand as often as updated data is provided. The Covisint Dashboard provides the ability to track measures and performance throughout the year driving improved performance with actionable information. All reports use drilldown capabilities where appropriate and are designed to be immediately useful for quality improvement to either your data collection infrastructure or care delivery workflow.

What is the Physician Quality Reporting System?Formerly known as PQRI (Physician Quality Reporting Initiative), the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) is a CMS Pay-For-Performance program that started in 2007. It began as a voluntary, incentivized program where eligible physicians report quality clinical data, collected during patient visits, to CMS. Participation in Physician Quality Reporting is now mandated and failure to report will result in penalties. There are multiple ways to report data for Physician Quality Reporting including:

Claims-based – where quality data codes associated with individual measures (pieces of clinical data) are reported and turned in on claims directly to CMS
EHR-based – where eligible professionals report quality measures using a qualified EHR
Registry-based – where eligible professionals or groups report data for individual measures or measures groups to a CMS-certified registry like Covisint PQRS
Web Interface – where groups report directly through the CMS portal

For additional information, visit the CMS website.
What does this program have to do with improving patient and care quality?The Physician Quality Reporting System is designed to “support the delivery of consistent high-quality care, promote efficient outcomes in our healthcare system”, as well as to encourage appropriate documentation of data in a patient’s medical chart for follow up or reference at a later date/time. Reporting the requested data for the Physician Quality Reporting System promotes awareness by providers and practices about what data may or may not be fully or appropriately documented during their current processes.
How do I know if I am eligible to participate in the Physician Quality Reporting System?Refer to the CMS list of eligible professionals at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/PQRS/downloads//EligibleProfessionals.pdf.What is the incentive for 2016 PQRS reporting?There are no longer any incentives for PQRS reporting. Additional penalties or incentives based on the Value Based Modifier (VM), however, may apply. Refer to the VM question for more information.
How much is the penalty and how is it applied?Eligible Professionals (EPs) who successfully report PQRS in 2016 can avoid a -2.0% payment reduction in your 2018 fee schedule reimbursements. Additional penalties or incentives based on the Value Based Modifier (VM) may also apply. Refer to that question for more information.
How and when will I know if my submission was successful?CMS considers all result information related to your submission confidential to your practice and Covisint does not have access to this information. Historically this information is available in the fall of the year following the reporting year. See the next question on feedback reports for more.
What is a Feedback Report and how do I get one?Feedback Reports are available for every TIN, under which at least one eligible professional (identified by his or her National Provider Identifier, or NPI) submitting Medicare Part B PFS claims, reported. Feedback Reports provide a breakdown of submission data, eligibility, payment and penalty information. These reports are not automatically provided and must be requested from CMS and your Medicare carrier.
In 2012 CMS added the ability to request a feedback report through the Quality Reporting Communication Support page at http://www.qualitynet.org/pqrs (see the Related Links in the upper left corner of the web page). Click on the Communication Support Page link then choose Create NPI Level Report Request and follow the instructions to request your feedback report.
How can I contact CMS with additional questions?You can contact the Quality Net Help Desk at 866-288-8912 or http://www.qualitynet.org/. Additional information can also be found on the CMS website. You can also participate in CMS-sponsored National Provider Calls.

PQRS 2016 Reporting Requirements
Are there any changes for 2016?Some of the changes for 2016 PQRS reporting are below. This list is not intended to be all inclusive. Refer to the CMS PQRS webpage for additional information.

There are three new measures groups – Cardiovascular Prevention, Diabetic Retinopathy, and Multiple Chronic Conditions. See question below for all available measures groups offered by Covisint in 2016.
Failure to report will result in a negative payment adjustment of -2.0% in 2018. Additional penalties or incentives based on the Value Based Modifier (VM) may also apply. Refer to that question for more information.
EP’s with 2+ providers must either 1) register to report as a GPRO OR 2) at least ½ of the eligible professionals under their tax ID must report successfully. See the question on the VM for more information.
Refer to the 2016 Measure Group specifications for each measure group to see any specific reporting and patient requirements changes.
Individual measure reporting requires reporting on 9 measures across 3 domains at a 50% reporting rate in order to avoid the payment adjustment. In addition EP’s who have at least one face-to-face encounter are required to report a minimum of one cross-cutting measure. EPs who report 1-8 measures will be subject to the Measure-Applicability Validation (MAV) process. Refer to the CMS MAV document for more information on the MAV process.
Groups with 100+ providers are required to have all CAHPS for PQRS survey measures reported on its behalf via a CMS certified survey vendor, and report at least 6 additional measures, outside of CAHPS for PQRS, covering at least 2 of the NQS domains using the qualified registry.
New in 2011 and remaining for 2016 is the zero percent performance rule– see question specific to this topic below for additional information.

How do I get started and which reporting option I should choose?Eligible professionals should consider their practice, specialty, size, resources, and technology used when determining how to report. Refer to the CMS How to Get Started web page for reporting options and additional information. Covisint also offers free webinars and Q&A sessions throughout the year which you can attend. See the main page for a schedule.What is the reporting criteria for Individual EPs?Individual EPs can report through a registry using the individual measure reporting option or on a single measures group. Individual measure reporting requires 9 measures across 3 domains at a 50% reporting rate as well as one cross-cutting measure if they have at least one face-to-face encounter. EP’s reporting less than 9 measures will be subject to the MAV. Refer to our website for the document on the MAV process.
For measures group reporting individual EPs can report on one measures group for 20 applicable patients.
Refer to the CMS registry reporting made simple document for more information.
Do all the patients have to be traditional Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service?It depends on the reporting option. The 2016 requirement for the measure group reporting option is that greater than half or 11 out of 20 patients must be Medicare Part B FFS (primary, secondary or railroad).
The individual measure reporting option through a qualified registry requires reporting on only Medicare Part B FFS patients including primary, secondary and railroad.
What are the available measures groups for 2016? A measures group is composed of six to ten individual measures and they are created and approved by CMS. They are only reportable by individual eligible professionals. Measures groups are not editable to include or omit specific individual measures. Covisint will offer 24 approved measures groups for 2016 reporting. The following measures groups are available:



Acute Otitis Externa (AOE) (2+)
Hepatitis C (18+)


Asthma (5+)
HIV/Aids (13+)


CABG (18+)
Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) (18+)


CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) (18+)
Multiple Chronic Conditions (66+)


Cardiovascular Prevention (21+)
Oncology (18+)


Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) (18+)
Optimizing Patient Exposure to Ionizing Radiation (OPEIR) (18-75)


CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) (18+)
Parkinson’s (18+)


Dementia (All ages)
Preventive Care (50+)


Diabetes (18-75)
RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) (18+)


Diabetic Retinopathy (18-75)
Sinusitis (18+)


General Surgery (18+)
Sleep Apnea (18+)


Heart Failure (18+)
Total Knee Replacement (TKR) (18-75)



Can I earn incentive submitting data on additional measures or more than one measure group? No. Submitting more data than required will not earn additional incentive.What if none of the measures groups or measures within the measures group applies to us? (Zero Percent Performance Rate)The zero percent rule implemented in 2011 continues for 2016 Physician Quality Reporting. Whether reporting individual measures or a measures group, measures with a 0% performance rate (100% for inverse measures), are not considered successfully reporting.
An eligible professional reporting via registry for a measures group needs to report all of the measures in the group (where the patient is eligible for the measure) for 20 patients AND have a performance rate >0% for each applicable measure during a specified reporting period to be considered incentive eligible. Note: An inverse measure with a 100% performance rate will not be counted as satisfactorily reporting the measures group. An answer of “Not Done/Unknown” or “Performance Not Met” equivalent for all eligible patients for a given measure within the measures group will result in a performance rate of 0% for that measure and the provider will not have successfully reported.
In cases where a measure within a measures group is not applicable to a patient, the patient would not be counted in the performance denominator for that measure (e.g., Preventive Care Measures Group – Measure #39: Screening or Therapy for Osteoporosis for Women would not be applicable to male patients according to the patient sample criteria). If there are NO eligible patients for a given measure within a measures group the result would be a 0/0 or NULL performance and would be considered acceptable reporting.
Providers with specialties that do not fit within the guidelines for measures groups approved by CMS are encouraged to report using an alternative reporting method. Covisint also offers an individual measure reporting option. Refer to our webpage for more information on alternative reporting methods or contact us for additional information.
How do I choose which individual measures to report? The measures you choose should be based on your specialty and patient population. There are nearly 300 individual registry measures from which to choose. Consider measures you already track for other programs however make sure the specifications are identical and that you are measuring the same thing. Other considerations and information on measure selection can be found on the CMS PQRS measure codes webpage.What is a GPRO? In 2010 CMS added the group practice reporting option or GPRO. Groups of eligible professionals reporting under a single tax id have the option to self-nominate to report as a group instead of individually. There are several ways to participate including through a qualified GPRO registry such as Covisint. Groups who would like to report as a GPRO in 2016 must register by June 30, 2016. Be sure you understand exactly what is required, including cost and ability to provide required data, before you make the election as you can’t change your mind after the deadline has passed.What is the Value Based Modifier?  CMS began applying a value based modifier (VM) in 2016 based on 2013 PQRS reporting.  Both cost and quality data composites are to be included in calculating payments for physicians. All physicians who participate in Fee-For-Service Medicare will be impacted by CMS’ emphasis on reporting quality data through PQRS and by 2017 will be affected by the value modifier. Click here for more on the 2016 value-based payment modifier.If I participate in the Meaningful Use/EHR incentive do I still have to participate in the Physician Quality Reporting System? Yes, these are separate incentive/penalty programs with different reporting requirements and penalties may be applied for both.Do I still need to report for e-prescribing? No, the e-Prescribing incentive program is over.Can my PQRS reporting through Covisint be applied toward the MU CQM requirement? No, the MU CQM measures must come from your EMR/EHR.Does a copy of the patient appointment list have to be submitted with the data? No. However, documentation in the patient’s chart is required. We recommend that you retain a copy of the source documents you used to determine reported patients for auditing purposes. EP’s are responsible to CMS for any audit requirements.
Reporting through Covisint
Is Covisint an approved CMS registry? Yes, check the 2016 Qualified Registry Vendor list on the CMS website.
What PQRS reporting options are available through the Covisint PQRS registry?

Measures Group (there are 24 available)
Individual Measures (reported by individual EPs through the Covisint web portal)
Data Mining Analysis

GPRO
Individual EPs



If I have already started reporting data with my claims can I still submit data for payment using Covisint PQRS? Yes. You can submit both methods but CMS will not combine two methods in order to meet the requirements. CMS will review all submissions and accept the submission that is most beneficial to the provider.We self-nominated to report as a GPRO, can you help us? Yes, Covisint is a qualified registry and can report on behalf of a group who self-nominated before the June 30, 2016 deadline choosing the GPRO Registry reporting option. Covisint analyzes your claims and available clinical data files to identify applicable measures and performance for your physician group. A GPRO cannot report through our web tool. Contact sales directly at 866-823-3958 for more information or to sign up.
What are the requirements to submit a measures group using the Covisint PQRS web application?

Register each provider using their Individual NPI and Federal TIN. (Note: Changes in TIN during the reporting calendar year may require multiple reporting, once under each TIN. Contact a Sales representative at 866-823-3958 for guidance)
Each provider selects one measure group to report (if there are multiple providers in a practice they do not have to report the same measure group)
Each provider selects 20 unique patients, of which greater than half or a minimum of 11 need to be Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service patients that meet ALL the requirements for the selected measure group (Refer to the Measure Group Guides on our Home Page once registered and logged into the web application for patient and reporting requirements)
Answer all the individual measures within the selected measure group for each of the patients, making sure to leave nothing blank. For most measures, there is the option to answer “Not Done/Unknown” or something similar. However, you cannot report “Not Done/Unknown” or “Performance Not Met” for all 20 patients for any given individual measure within the measure group.

Please refer to the question that explains the zero percent performance rates.


Once you’ve collected the data on all 20 patients, log into the web application using your username and password and enter the patient data under the appropriate provider.
Review your PQRS Submission Summary report to verify there are no 0% performance rate issues.
Submit
If you have Internet connection in the exam room, you can skip using the data collection forms to collect the data and enter it directly into the web application at the time of the visit.

If I registered for Covisint PQRS last year, do I need to register again this year? No. You do not need to re-register to access the Covisint web application. Your login credentials will carry over each year. Use your same username and password to login to the 2016 web application. If you cannot remember your username and/or password please contact the Covisint PQRS Support Team at 866-823-3959 to have it reset.What is the cost to report PQRS data through Covisint?It is $299 per provider to submit using the Covisint PQRS web application. There is no registration fee and no upfront costs. The one-time payment of $299 per provider is paid at the time of submission using any major credit card. Discounts may be available through your state medical society. Physician organizations can contact Covisint for discounted pricing.
The fee for Covisint PQRS Enterprise for large provider groups or GPROs varies slightly depending on the number of submitted providers. This service is more costly than the web application. As such, we recommend it for larger practices (≥25 providers) to ensure cost effectiveness. There is an upfront data file processing fee and a per provider submission fee. Please contact a Covisint PQRS Sales representative at 866-823-3958 for additional pricing information on this reporting option.
Can we be invoiced for our providers’ submissions? Yes. You will need to contact a Covisint PQRS Sales representative at 866-823-3958 to receive a coupon code to use at each submission.When is the last day to report for 2016? The Covisint web application will close for 2016 PQRS reporting on March 3, 2017. Check our website for any changes to this date which is subject to change as required. Be sure that your submission is completed in time to allow for any necessary corrections or changes. Once we close for the reporting year all submissions are considered FINAL. Covisint strongly recommends you do not wait until the final weeks to report.
How do I contact Covisint for additional questions or support? You can reach Covisint PQRS Sales at 866.823.3958 or info.covisint@covisint.com. For assistance with a password reset only call Covisint PQRS support at 866-823-3959.

Securing and managing the connected vehicle ecosystem
Transform the ownership experience with one cloud platform.




Mobility-as-a-Service
Usage-based Insurance




Monetizing Telematics
Over-the-Air Updates









Hyundai securely connects owners to their vehicles – driving customer intimacy





Covisint enables Hyundai to rapidly build new connected vehicle services, allowing the OEM to continually engage with customers throughout the entire lifecycle of ownership. Hyundai leverages Covisint’s foundational technologies to create a 360-view of the customer and share information across the extended vehicle ecosystem, in a secure and scalable way.
Hyundai BlueLink — built on the Covisint IoT Platform — is a mobile application that allows owners to monitor vehicle health, communicate conveniently with service representatives and control their vehicle remotely, from just about anywhere. The Covisint IoT Platform seamlessly integrates the numerous systems associated with the vehicle, and manages the identities of all drivers, devices and cars across the ecosystem.













Mobility-as-a-Service

Emerging technology, urban growth, and new mobility players has altered consumer transportation behavior, shifting from traditional vehicle ownership to shared mobility. Automotive OEMs are rapidly capitalizing on new business models for vehicle sales, by creating value-added mobility services. OEMs and partners can capitalize on mobility-as-a-service by monetizing the time consumers spend in the vehicle during drive time, while providing a desired customer experience. 
To deliver mobility-as-a-service, OEMs need a centralized platform to securely integrate and communicates all entities. A successful user experience will hinge on the ability for OEMs to manage the complete ecosystem. Covisint can assist by providing a centralized IoT Platform that securely identifies, authenticate and connect users, devices, and information, with the flexibility for quick to market solutions.








Monetizing Telematics
The automotive market is transforming to an economy-of-services, subscriber-based revenue models and positive ownership experiences. The connected vehicle provides a wide array of data to help OEMs make better decisions, improve safety, and increase proﬁtability. OEMs are looking for a competitive edge while delivering on customer expectations of value added services.
Telematics facilitates the passage of data from the IoT-edge to the Cloud, which is fundamental to building connected vehicle solutions that enhance the user experience, unlock value, and bring insights to light. However, OEMs must be able to manage multiple stakeholders and desperate systems, while providing a secured data environment. Covisint can help OEMs build telematics-based solutions securely managing the connected vehicle ecosystems, and provide an open-development IoT Platform enabling rapid prototyping, development and integration of telematics services.









Usage-based Insurance





Advancements in connected vehicle technologies, telematics and analytics, have enabled the automotive industry to provide value services to consumers while growing new revenue streams.  UBI is poised for massive adoption in both emerging and industrialized global markets. Consumers are demanding ways to reduce cost of vehicle ownership.  The value of UBI depends on the ability to provide access to real-time, relevant vehicle data on a mass scale.  
By accessing this data, insurers can make better decisions on driver behavior, allowing for more personalized insurance premium offerings for consumers.  Automotive OEMs need a platform that can offer UBI developments from concept to market.  The Covisint IoT Platform provides a foundation from which to build UBI services that orchestrate the secure, pervasive and deliberate ﬂow of information to the right people, systems and things.




Over-the-Air Updates





Vehicles today are produced with several firmware and software components to provide quality product offerings to consumers. Automotive OEMs are continuously looking for efficient ways to simplify product updates, effectively address recalls or prevent recall, reduce warranty cost and improve offerings for a better customer experience. The connected vehicle allows OEMs to remotely carry out system refreshes, bug ﬁxes or even a ‘digital recall’.
Growing consumer concern about data safety and security, compliance with federal and state regulations and mandates, and assuring accuracy and timeliness of updates are just a few challenges confronting OTA updates. Covisint enables OTA updates by securely integrating the related components and systems, providing flexibility to implement, assure data security, and meet OMA-DM compliance.
