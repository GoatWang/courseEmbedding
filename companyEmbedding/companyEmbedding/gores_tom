Personal life[edit]
Tom Gores was born into a practicing Catholic family in Nazareth, Israel, the son of a father of Greek descent and a mother of Lebanese descent.[4][5] In 1968, the family moved to Genesee, Michigan. While a student at Genesee High School, Gores played defensive back in football, middle infielder in baseball, and guard in basketball.[6] He received a scholarship to attend Michigan State University, where he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in construction management.[7] He spent his twenties learning the buyout business with his older brother Alec. Prior to joining his brother, Tom was working at Continental Telephone for a short stint.
Gores lives in Beverly Hills, California with his wife and three children. He also has a condo in Birmingham, Michigan.
Business career[edit]
As a global private equity business magnate, Gores was estimated in 2011 by Forbes to be the 159th-richest American with a $2.5 billion fortune. He founded the Beverly Hills, California based Platinum Equity LLC in 1995 with the intent to acquire non-core divisions of Fortune 1000 corporations.[8] Platinum Equity has since expanded its investment criteria to include public-to-private transactions and acquisitions from private sellers. Since its founding, the firm has acquired more than 130 companies in industries that include technology and IT services, manufacturing, industrials, distribution, transportation and logistics, and equipment rentals.[9]
In 2010, Platinum Equity was recognized as one of the largest and fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking #31 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list in 2010[10] and #1 on the 2010 and 2011 Los Angeles Business Journal list of LA's Largest Private Companies.[11] In 2011, Platinum Equity rose to #23 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list, due to a 22.4% increase in the firm's revenue.[12] In 2011, Platinum ranked #7 on the Los Angeles Business Journal’s list of the Largest Private Equity Firms in Los Angeles.[13]
Press[edit]
Gores was featured on the April 2010 cover of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine as its “Pro of the Year.” [14] In addition, Gores was featured on the Summer 2011 cover of C-Suite Quarterly with an article entitled “Tom Gores On Balancing Family, Business, and The Detroit Pistons.” [15]
Detroit Pistons ownership[edit]
On June 1, 2011, Tom Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E), the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills, from Karen Davidson, the wife of the late Bill Davidson, becoming only the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history.[16] According to Crain's Detroit Business, the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.[17] Still, it was a handsome return on Davidson's original investment; he'd bought the team from founding owner Fred Zollner in 1974 for $6 million.
Soon after Gores and Platinum Equity took ownership, the Pistons made several leadership changes including appointing Dennis Mannion to oversee operations of PS&E and the Pistons and Lawrence Frank as head coach of the Pistons.[18] Frank was the former head coach of the New Jersey Nets, now known as the Brooklyn Nets.[19] Former Pistons star Joe Dumars remained as President of Basketball Operations.[20]
Under Gores' ownership, PS&E and the Pistons have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the Detroit community through programs that include "Seats for Soldiers,"[21] which provides free tickets for PS&E events to US armed forces members and their families, as well as "Come Together," a program celebrating community service, leadership, and volunteerism throughout Michigan.[22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tom Gores supports several philanthropic organizations,[23] and serves on the board of trustees for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).[24] He was also a member of the board of directors at St. Joseph's Hospital and UCLA Medical Center. In 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity began making a series of donations to San Diego-area causes and institutions, including the San Diego State University School of Journalism and Media Studies, public broadcasting service KPBS, the AVID Center, Junior Achievement, and the Classroom of the Future Foundation. Tom Gores and his family help to support Children's Hospital Los Angeles and in particular the Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. As a result, the Gores Family Allergy center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was formed to help provide comprehensive care and research in allergy.
Gores and his brother Alec donated $250,000 to Genesee High School in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.[1]
Since January 29, 2016 Tom has pledged to help raise $10 million for the city of Flint, Michigan as the lead crisis continues.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Personal life[edit]
Tom Gores was born into a practicing Catholic family in Nazareth, Israel, the son of a father of Greek descent and a mother of Lebanese descent.[4][5] In 1968, the family moved to Genesee, Michigan. While a student at Genesee High School, Gores played defensive back in football, middle infielder in baseball, and guard in basketball.[6] He received a scholarship to attend Michigan State University, where he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in construction management.[7] He spent his twenties learning the buyout business with his older brother Alec. Prior to joining his brother, Tom was working at Continental Telephone for a short stint.
Gores lives in Beverly Hills, California with his wife and three children. He also has a condo in Birmingham, Michigan.
Business career[edit]
As a global private equity business magnate, Gores was estimated in 2011 by Forbes to be the 159th-richest American with a $2.5 billion fortune. He founded the Beverly Hills, California based Platinum Equity LLC in 1995 with the intent to acquire non-core divisions of Fortune 1000 corporations.[8] Platinum Equity has since expanded its investment criteria to include public-to-private transactions and acquisitions from private sellers. Since its founding, the firm has acquired more than 130 companies in industries that include technology and IT services, manufacturing, industrials, distribution, transportation and logistics, and equipment rentals.[9]
In 2010, Platinum Equity was recognized as one of the largest and fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking #31 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list in 2010[10] and #1 on the 2010 and 2011 Los Angeles Business Journal list of LA's Largest Private Companies.[11] In 2011, Platinum Equity rose to #23 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list, due to a 22.4% increase in the firm's revenue.[12] In 2011, Platinum ranked #7 on the Los Angeles Business Journal’s list of the Largest Private Equity Firms in Los Angeles.[13]
Press[edit]
Gores was featured on the April 2010 cover of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine as its “Pro of the Year.” [14] In addition, Gores was featured on the Summer 2011 cover of C-Suite Quarterly with an article entitled “Tom Gores On Balancing Family, Business, and The Detroit Pistons.” [15]
Detroit Pistons ownership[edit]
On June 1, 2011, Tom Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E), the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills, from Karen Davidson, the wife of the late Bill Davidson, becoming only the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history.[16] According to Crain's Detroit Business, the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.[17] Still, it was a handsome return on Davidson's original investment; he'd bought the team from founding owner Fred Zollner in 1974 for $6 million.
Soon after Gores and Platinum Equity took ownership, the Pistons made several leadership changes including appointing Dennis Mannion to oversee operations of PS&E and the Pistons and Lawrence Frank as head coach of the Pistons.[18] Frank was the former head coach of the New Jersey Nets, now known as the Brooklyn Nets.[19] Former Pistons star Joe Dumars remained as President of Basketball Operations.[20]
Under Gores' ownership, PS&E and the Pistons have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the Detroit community through programs that include "Seats for Soldiers,"[21] which provides free tickets for PS&E events to US armed forces members and their families, as well as "Come Together," a program celebrating community service, leadership, and volunteerism throughout Michigan.[22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tom Gores supports several philanthropic organizations,[23] and serves on the board of trustees for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).[24] He was also a member of the board of directors at St. Joseph's Hospital and UCLA Medical Center. In 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity began making a series of donations to San Diego-area causes and institutions, including the San Diego State University School of Journalism and Media Studies, public broadcasting service KPBS, the AVID Center, Junior Achievement, and the Classroom of the Future Foundation. Tom Gores and his family help to support Children's Hospital Los Angeles and in particular the Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. As a result, the Gores Family Allergy center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was formed to help provide comprehensive care and research in allergy.
Gores and his brother Alec donated $250,000 to Genesee High School in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.[1]
Since January 29, 2016 Tom has pledged to help raise $10 million for the city of Flint, Michigan as the lead crisis continues.

Personal life[edit]
Tom Gores was born into a practicing Catholic family in Nazareth, Israel, the son of a father of Greek descent and a mother of Lebanese descent.[4][5] In 1968, the family moved to Genesee, Michigan. While a student at Genesee High School, Gores played defensive back in football, middle infielder in baseball, and guard in basketball.[6] He received a scholarship to attend Michigan State University, where he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in construction management.[7] He spent his twenties learning the buyout business with his older brother Alec. Prior to joining his brother, Tom was working at Continental Telephone for a short stint.
Gores lives in Beverly Hills, California with his wife and three children. He also has a condo in Birmingham, Michigan.
Business career[edit]
As a global private equity business magnate, Gores was estimated in 2011 by Forbes to be the 159th-richest American with a $2.5 billion fortune. He founded the Beverly Hills, California based Platinum Equity LLC in 1995 with the intent to acquire non-core divisions of Fortune 1000 corporations.[8] Platinum Equity has since expanded its investment criteria to include public-to-private transactions and acquisitions from private sellers. Since its founding, the firm has acquired more than 130 companies in industries that include technology and IT services, manufacturing, industrials, distribution, transportation and logistics, and equipment rentals.[9]
In 2010, Platinum Equity was recognized as one of the largest and fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking #31 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list in 2010[10] and #1 on the 2010 and 2011 Los Angeles Business Journal list of LA's Largest Private Companies.[11] In 2011, Platinum Equity rose to #23 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list, due to a 22.4% increase in the firm's revenue.[12] In 2011, Platinum ranked #7 on the Los Angeles Business Journal’s list of the Largest Private Equity Firms in Los Angeles.[13]
Press[edit]
Gores was featured on the April 2010 cover of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine as its “Pro of the Year.” [14] In addition, Gores was featured on the Summer 2011 cover of C-Suite Quarterly with an article entitled “Tom Gores On Balancing Family, Business, and The Detroit Pistons.” [15]
Detroit Pistons ownership[edit]
On June 1, 2011, Tom Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E), the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills, from Karen Davidson, the wife of the late Bill Davidson, becoming only the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history.[16] According to Crain's Detroit Business, the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.[17] Still, it was a handsome return on Davidson's original investment; he'd bought the team from founding owner Fred Zollner in 1974 for $6 million.
Soon after Gores and Platinum Equity took ownership, the Pistons made several leadership changes including appointing Dennis Mannion to oversee operations of PS&E and the Pistons and Lawrence Frank as head coach of the Pistons.[18] Frank was the former head coach of the New Jersey Nets, now known as the Brooklyn Nets.[19] Former Pistons star Joe Dumars remained as President of Basketball Operations.[20]
Under Gores' ownership, PS&E and the Pistons have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the Detroit community through programs that include "Seats for Soldiers,"[21] which provides free tickets for PS&E events to US armed forces members and their families, as well as "Come Together," a program celebrating community service, leadership, and volunteerism throughout Michigan.[22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tom Gores supports several philanthropic organizations,[23] and serves on the board of trustees for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).[24] He was also a member of the board of directors at St. Joseph's Hospital and UCLA Medical Center. In 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity began making a series of donations to San Diego-area causes and institutions, including the San Diego State University School of Journalism and Media Studies, public broadcasting service KPBS, the AVID Center, Junior Achievement, and the Classroom of the Future Foundation. Tom Gores and his family help to support Children's Hospital Los Angeles and in particular the Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. As a result, the Gores Family Allergy center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was formed to help provide comprehensive care and research in allergy.
Gores and his brother Alec donated $250,000 to Genesee High School in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.[1]
Since January 29, 2016 Tom has pledged to help raise $10 million for the city of Flint, Michigan as the lead crisis continues.

Our History










Investment Strategy
        Our investment strategy has remained consistent for over 25 years: we specialize in acquiring businesses that are undergoing change in capital structure, strategy, operations or growth and can benefit from Gores’ operational and strategic approach.  We target companies with a defensible core business, mature products or services, sustainable revenues, established customer relationships, and that have reached a transition point in their lifecycle presenting an opportunity for transformation.

Our financial expertise and significant in-house resources allow us to be flexible in investment structure, type and size. Since our founding, we have carved out divisional assets through corporate-divestitures, partnered with family-owned businesses and management teams, grown companies through industry consolidation strategies, and have taken public companies private. This flexibility allows us to be opportunistic so we can uncover optimal investments for the benefit of the companies we invest in as well as our investment partners.

Additionally, operational transformation is key to the value we create. Our in-house Gores Operations Group works exclusively with our portfolio companies and collaborates closely with management teams to establish viable operational blueprints, launch marketing and product initiatives, determine areas to invest for growth, and build stronger and better companies.

We apply a consistent investment approach across North America and Europe. The ability to invest in multiple geographies provides Gores with an effective platform to deploy capital across a diverse set of businesses, capture opportunities in a variety of geographic regions, and create measurable value for our investment partners and portfolio companies.

Personal life[edit]
Tom Gores was born into a practicing Catholic family in Nazareth, Israel, the son of a father of Greek descent and a mother of Lebanese descent.[4][5] In 1968, the family moved to Genesee, Michigan. While a student at Genesee High School, Gores played defensive back in football, middle infielder in baseball, and guard in basketball.[6] He received a scholarship to attend Michigan State University, where he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in construction management.[7] He spent his twenties learning the buyout business with his older brother Alec. Prior to joining his brother, Tom was working at Continental Telephone for a short stint.
Gores lives in Beverly Hills, California with his wife and three children. He also has a condo in Birmingham, Michigan.
Business career[edit]
As a global private equity business magnate, Gores was estimated in 2011 by Forbes to be the 159th-richest American with a $2.5 billion fortune. He founded the Beverly Hills, California based Platinum Equity LLC in 1995 with the intent to acquire non-core divisions of Fortune 1000 corporations.[8] Platinum Equity has since expanded its investment criteria to include public-to-private transactions and acquisitions from private sellers. Since its founding, the firm has acquired more than 130 companies in industries that include technology and IT services, manufacturing, industrials, distribution, transportation and logistics, and equipment rentals.[9]
In 2010, Platinum Equity was recognized as one of the largest and fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking #31 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list in 2010[10] and #1 on the 2010 and 2011 Los Angeles Business Journal list of LA's Largest Private Companies.[11] In 2011, Platinum Equity rose to #23 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list, due to a 22.4% increase in the firm's revenue.[12] In 2011, Platinum ranked #7 on the Los Angeles Business Journal’s list of the Largest Private Equity Firms in Los Angeles.[13]
Press[edit]
Gores was featured on the April 2010 cover of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine as its “Pro of the Year.” [14] In addition, Gores was featured on the Summer 2011 cover of C-Suite Quarterly with an article entitled “Tom Gores On Balancing Family, Business, and The Detroit Pistons.” [15]
Detroit Pistons ownership[edit]
On June 1, 2011, Tom Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E), the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills, from Karen Davidson, the wife of the late Bill Davidson, becoming only the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history.[16] According to Crain's Detroit Business, the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.[17] Still, it was a handsome return on Davidson's original investment; he'd bought the team from founding owner Fred Zollner in 1974 for $6 million.
Soon after Gores and Platinum Equity took ownership, the Pistons made several leadership changes including appointing Dennis Mannion to oversee operations of PS&E and the Pistons and Lawrence Frank as head coach of the Pistons.[18] Frank was the former head coach of the New Jersey Nets, now known as the Brooklyn Nets.[19] Former Pistons star Joe Dumars remained as President of Basketball Operations.[20]
Under Gores' ownership, PS&E and the Pistons have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the Detroit community through programs that include "Seats for Soldiers,"[21] which provides free tickets for PS&E events to US armed forces members and their families, as well as "Come Together," a program celebrating community service, leadership, and volunteerism throughout Michigan.[22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tom Gores supports several philanthropic organizations,[23] and serves on the board of trustees for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).[24] He was also a member of the board of directors at St. Joseph's Hospital and UCLA Medical Center. In 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity began making a series of donations to San Diego-area causes and institutions, including the San Diego State University School of Journalism and Media Studies, public broadcasting service KPBS, the AVID Center, Junior Achievement, and the Classroom of the Future Foundation. Tom Gores and his family help to support Children's Hospital Los Angeles and in particular the Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. As a result, the Gores Family Allergy center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was formed to help provide comprehensive care and research in allergy.
Gores and his brother Alec donated $250,000 to Genesee High School in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.[1]
Since January 29, 2016 Tom has pledged to help raise $10 million for the city of Flint, Michigan as the lead crisis continues.

Personal life[edit]
Tom Gores was born into a practicing Catholic family in Nazareth, Israel, the son of a father of Greek descent and a mother of Lebanese descent.[4][5] In 1968, the family moved to Genesee, Michigan. While a student at Genesee High School, Gores played defensive back in football, middle infielder in baseball, and guard in basketball.[6] He received a scholarship to attend Michigan State University, where he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in construction management.[7] He spent his twenties learning the buyout business with his older brother Alec. Prior to joining his brother, Tom was working at Continental Telephone for a short stint.
Gores lives in Beverly Hills, California with his wife and three children. He also has a condo in Birmingham, Michigan.
Business career[edit]
As a global private equity business magnate, Gores was estimated in 2011 by Forbes to be the 159th-richest American with a $2.5 billion fortune. He founded the Beverly Hills, California based Platinum Equity LLC in 1995 with the intent to acquire non-core divisions of Fortune 1000 corporations.[8] Platinum Equity has since expanded its investment criteria to include public-to-private transactions and acquisitions from private sellers. Since its founding, the firm has acquired more than 130 companies in industries that include technology and IT services, manufacturing, industrials, distribution, transportation and logistics, and equipment rentals.[9]
In 2010, Platinum Equity was recognized as one of the largest and fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking #31 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list in 2010[10] and #1 on the 2010 and 2011 Los Angeles Business Journal list of LA's Largest Private Companies.[11] In 2011, Platinum Equity rose to #23 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list, due to a 22.4% increase in the firm's revenue.[12] In 2011, Platinum ranked #7 on the Los Angeles Business Journal’s list of the Largest Private Equity Firms in Los Angeles.[13]
Press[edit]
Gores was featured on the April 2010 cover of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine as its “Pro of the Year.” [14] In addition, Gores was featured on the Summer 2011 cover of C-Suite Quarterly with an article entitled “Tom Gores On Balancing Family, Business, and The Detroit Pistons.” [15]
Detroit Pistons ownership[edit]
On June 1, 2011, Tom Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E), the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills, from Karen Davidson, the wife of the late Bill Davidson, becoming only the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history.[16] According to Crain's Detroit Business, the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.[17] Still, it was a handsome return on Davidson's original investment; he'd bought the team from founding owner Fred Zollner in 1974 for $6 million.
Soon after Gores and Platinum Equity took ownership, the Pistons made several leadership changes including appointing Dennis Mannion to oversee operations of PS&E and the Pistons and Lawrence Frank as head coach of the Pistons.[18] Frank was the former head coach of the New Jersey Nets, now known as the Brooklyn Nets.[19] Former Pistons star Joe Dumars remained as President of Basketball Operations.[20]
Under Gores' ownership, PS&E and the Pistons have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the Detroit community through programs that include "Seats for Soldiers,"[21] which provides free tickets for PS&E events to US armed forces members and their families, as well as "Come Together," a program celebrating community service, leadership, and volunteerism throughout Michigan.[22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tom Gores supports several philanthropic organizations,[23] and serves on the board of trustees for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).[24] He was also a member of the board of directors at St. Joseph's Hospital and UCLA Medical Center. In 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity began making a series of donations to San Diego-area causes and institutions, including the San Diego State University School of Journalism and Media Studies, public broadcasting service KPBS, the AVID Center, Junior Achievement, and the Classroom of the Future Foundation. Tom Gores and his family help to support Children's Hospital Los Angeles and in particular the Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. As a result, the Gores Family Allergy center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was formed to help provide comprehensive care and research in allergy.
Gores and his brother Alec donated $250,000 to Genesee High School in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.[1]
Since January 29, 2016 Tom has pledged to help raise $10 million for the city of Flint, Michigan as the lead crisis continues.

In 2010, Platinum Equity was recognized as one of the largest and fastest-growing private companies in America, ranking #31 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list in 2010[10] and #1 on the 2010 and 2011 Los Angeles Business Journal list of LA's Largest Private Companies.[11] In 2011, Platinum Equity rose to #23 on Forbes’ Largest Private Companies list, due to a 22.4% increase in the firm's revenue.[12] In 2011, Platinum ranked #7 on the Los Angeles Business Journal’s list of the Largest Private Equity Firms in Los Angeles.[13]
Press[edit]
Gores was featured on the April 2010 cover of Mergers & Acquisitions magazine as its “Pro of the Year.” [14] In addition, Gores was featured on the Summer 2011 cover of C-Suite Quarterly with an article entitled “Tom Gores On Balancing Family, Business, and The Detroit Pistons.” [15]
Detroit Pistons ownership[edit]
On June 1, 2011, Tom Gores and Platinum Equity bought Palace Sports and Entertainment (PS&E), the parent company of the Pistons and their former arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills, from Karen Davidson, the wife of the late Bill Davidson, becoming only the third owner in the franchise's 70-year history.[16] According to Crain's Detroit Business, the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.[17] Still, it was a handsome return on Davidson's original investment; he'd bought the team from founding owner Fred Zollner in 1974 for $6 million.
Soon after Gores and Platinum Equity took ownership, the Pistons made several leadership changes including appointing Dennis Mannion to oversee operations of PS&E and the Pistons and Lawrence Frank as head coach of the Pistons.[18] Frank was the former head coach of the New Jersey Nets, now known as the Brooklyn Nets.[19] Former Pistons star Joe Dumars remained as President of Basketball Operations.[20]
Under Gores' ownership, PS&E and the Pistons have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the Detroit community through programs that include "Seats for Soldiers,"[21] which provides free tickets for PS&E events to US armed forces members and their families, as well as "Come Together," a program celebrating community service, leadership, and volunteerism throughout Michigan.[22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Tom Gores supports several philanthropic organizations,[23] and serves on the board of trustees for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).[24] He was also a member of the board of directors at St. Joseph's Hospital and UCLA Medical Center. In 2011, Gores and Platinum Equity began making a series of donations to San Diego-area causes and institutions, including the San Diego State University School of Journalism and Media Studies, public broadcasting service KPBS, the AVID Center, Junior Achievement, and the Classroom of the Future Foundation. Tom Gores and his family help to support Children's Hospital Los Angeles and in particular the Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy. As a result, the Gores Family Allergy center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles was formed to help provide comprehensive care and research in allergy.
Gores and his brother Alec donated $250,000 to Genesee High School in honor of Tom and Julia Joubran's 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.[1]
Since January 29, 2016 Tom has pledged to help raise $10 million for the city of Flint, Michigan as the lead crisis continues.

                    Voicecom Changes Name to Intelliverse and Launches New Product, Talking Planet                

March 1, 2006




                Atlanta, GA, March 1, 2006 - Voicecom, a hosted provider of turnkey residential and business focused communications services, announced today that the company has changed its name to Intelliverse. Accompanying the name change is the release of a new VoIP product offering, Talking Planet. Delivering the services that fit within the changing landscape of communications technology, Intelliverse makes sense of fast moving technology and turns it into useful, reliable communications solutions that leverage and connect traditional TDM based networks with next-generation VoIP based networks.

"Intelliverse represents the next era in the evolution of communications providers," said Kevin M. Moran, President and CEO of Intelliverse. "Gone are the days of commoditized services and isolated proprietary systems. Our mission is incredibly simple- to provide communications solutions that address the industry and business-specific needs of our customers regardless of their telecom and technology infrastructure."

A comprehensive Internet phone service that leverages the advantages of IP communications technology to deliver powerful Unified Communications features, Talking Planet is built to be rapidly deployed as a private label service for CLECs, hosting companies, and other communications Value Added Resellers. This solution includes a complete suite of customizable features including unlimited local and long distance calling, caller ID, call waiting, 3 way calling, E911/911, video calling, unified inbox, follow-me service, and voice-activated dialing.

Intelliverse was formed as a result of combining Voicecom Telecommunications, LLC, a 20-year veteran of the telecommunications industry providing call answering solutions for the business-to-business market and iNuntius, Inc., a VoIP pioneer with nine years of development in SIP-based VoIP and Unified Communications solutions. In November 2005, Voicecom acquired iNuntius and since that time the combined entity has been working to quickly integrate technologies and operations so it can begin to bring its unique blend of Internet and telephony-based services to the marketplace. With its debut of Talking Planet, Intelliverse does just that.

About Intelliverse

A leading provider of communications services for the Enterprise, Wholesale and Small & Medium Business market sectors, Intelliverse specializes in creating industry-specific communications solutions. To accomplish this, Intelliverse aligns sets of technology-based applications around specific business dynamics. The result is a suite of value-driven communications packages to address a customer's specific business needs. Communications Solved.

Founded in 1986, Intelliverse offers the stability of an established company plus the agility of an innovative technology provider. With over 20 years of experience, Intelliverse has solid technology foundations in VoIP, IVR, and messaging, yet has learned that while technology is one thing, technology applied is quite another. Intelliverse passionately listens to, hears, and responds to the daily and long-term needs of its clients around the world by developing solutions that recognize and address the issues important to its customers.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Intelliverse is a member of The Gores Group of companies and provides its services throughout North America. The company's solutions are designed to meet a diversity of needs including automated self-service & customer care, interpersonal messaging, and large-scale corporate communications. Intelliverse delivers its solutions across a variety of industries including Retail & Manufacturing, Food Services, Banking, Government Organizations, Real Estate, and Wholesale Telecommunications. More information can be found at www.intelliverse.com.

Founded in 1987, The Gores Group is a private equity firm focused on acquiring controlling interests in mature and growing businesses which can benefit from the firm's operating experience and flexible capital base.
