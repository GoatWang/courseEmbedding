Our Story | SteadyServ Technologies


























































































ABOUT


How We Got Here





SteadyServ started in 2012, when craft brewery owner Steve Hershberger teamed up with tech guy Steve Kremer to use technology to transform the way beer is sold and consumed. From there, the SteadyServ team started work on iKeg — an Internet of Things (IoT) system that utilizes smart scales and Kegonomics (cloud technology) to monitor keg levels.





Today, the iKeg technology is just one component of the SteadyServ system. The SteadyServ team is growing quickly, with the acquisition of PintsLabs – comprised of BreweryDB & BreweryMap – and with our 30+ passionate team members, we are on the way to transforming the way beer is sold and consumed.



Our TeamWe believe in hiring a brilliant and diverse bunch and providing them with the tools and flexibility they need to get the job done.

SteadyServ | Draft Beer Management System




























































































 


Unparalleled Draft Management 
SteadyServ® iKeg® is the low-cost, high return draft management system that enables you to view and analyze your retail location’s draft beer data on any device - and in real-time. Request A Demo   

Stop Pouring Beer Down the Drain
Did you know that at a typical restaurant pours about 20% of their beer down the drain or leaves it in the keg?
That’s thousands of dollars a month of potential revenue that goes unrealized.
How many times have you had to tell a customer, “Sorry, we’re out of that beer.” or “That keg just kicked?”
With SteadyServ iKeg, you’ll always know when a keg is about to kick.





Maximize Your RevenueMade up of beer industry veterans and hospitality legends, the SteadyServ team is bringing to light the unrealized draught revenue of establishments. We believe that beer shouldn’t be wasted – and on average, 20% of beer is indeed wasted.
Make Your Day EasierWe are passionate about the beer industry and want to revolutionize the old standard of shaking kegs. We are frustrated when establishments kick kegs and don’t have what we want on tap. Our frustration turns into your gain. 







Don't Take Our Word For It






"First and foremost, it holds everybody accountable. I don’t have employees going and pouring themselves beer off the clock. I don’t have people not ringing in beers because that system is all tracked. That’s the first thing, I love the accountability." - Timothy Wiles, General Manager, Burger Bach

How It WorksIt’s simple! You put your kegs on top of iKeg Smart Scales and – using the iKeg mobile app or website – let us know what beer is in the keg. Then, every few minutes, the scales will send information about the keg to our system. We’ll match up the beer in the keg to the sales from your POS system. We then crunch all the numbers and give you reports via our analytics platform, Kegonomics.






Real-Time SoftwareSteadyServ iKeg provides real-time insight into your tap lineup. With accurate keg levels, alerts, and comprehensive reports, iKeg enables to you make data-driven decisions about your business.






Unlimited Sales OpportunitiesAnalytics to grow and analyze your business. Monitor your draft performance, keep your inventory free, and optimize your draft lineup with powerful visualizations and reports.






One-of-a-Kind HardwareThe only draft beer management system that doesn’t touch your beer. A Smart Scale, RFID tag, and a wireless gateway is all you need to get up-to-the-minute accuracy.

Our Story | SteadyServ Technologies


























































































ABOUT


How We Got Here





SteadyServ started in 2012, when craft brewery owner Steve Hershberger teamed up with tech guy Steve Kremer to use technology to transform the way beer is sold and consumed. From there, the SteadyServ team started work on iKeg — an Internet of Things (IoT) system that utilizes smart scales and Kegonomics (cloud technology) to monitor keg levels.





Today, the iKeg technology is just one component of the SteadyServ system. The SteadyServ team is growing quickly, with the acquisition of PintsLabs – comprised of BreweryDB & BreweryMap – and with our 30+ passionate team members, we are on the way to transforming the way beer is sold and consumed.



Our TeamWe believe in hiring a brilliant and diverse bunch and providing them with the tools and flexibility they need to get the job done.

description
SteadyServ's iKeg ® technology is an IoT driven SaaS solution which measures and reports, on a near-real-time basis, down to the ounce, the exact volume of beer remaining in a retailer's kegs.   Up until today, it has been nearly impossible to track and manage draft beer inventory effectively.  Given that draft sales exceed $23 billion dollars each year in just the U.S., the cost of waste, lost sales and unimproved yields and margin is staggering.   The system uses collected intelligence to make purchase and product mix decisions based on the distributor’s current inventory, past on-premise performance, profitability goals, comparative popularity, and availability at nearby competitors.  The average retailer sees a 400% cash on cash return on investment.   SteadyServ has also developed a dynamic digital menu which showcases, and auto-curates every draft beer currently on tap, as well as, automatically updates and corrects beers when they change status (volume, price, availability).  This information can be manipulated based on consumption patterns and is augmented with contextual advertising, which has a positive impact on sales.  SteadyServ can provide retailers and brewers with onsite performance analytics with provide insights on marketing and promotion attribution. SteadyServ also owns the worlds largest database of beer, which it uses as part of the iKeg and Kegonomics solutions.  Moreover, SteadyServ ingests every retail transaction across every SKU its retail base sells, which provides SteadyServ a massive, rich  and real time database of draft beer and on-premise retail activity that before has been unavailable. SteadyServ ® has been awarded 2 PCT patents with two additional ones in the process of moving from 'pending' to active and four other patents pending.   The company operates throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and several EU countries currently.

Estimated website visits
This graph shows estimated monthly visits to the company website. As our data source puts it, "a visit is defined as an entry to a web domain from a different web domain or from the beginning of an empty browsing session, and expires after 30 minutes of inactivity."


Ok, thanks






















Funding stage comparison
This graph gives a simple snapshot of a startup's evolutionary position among its competitors. To determine a company's development stage, we count the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised. We then approximate and visualise a company's value -- the bigger its circle, the more valuable the company.
Why does it matter?
The size and number of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed. Investors use this basic data to take the pulse of a startup among its competitors that aim for the same market. Several funding rounds and sizable investments are a good gauge of current investors' confidence in the market, the business, and the team.
Ideally, you'll want to see the startup developing from the lower left corner of the graph to the top right. This would signify a gradual rise in both funding and value. Anomalies, such as multiple small funding rounds, or few very large funding rounds, also warrant closer inspection.


Ok, thanks










Value, Funderbeam estimate, $m
















Employee comparison
This graph shows staff growth over time. If an older company’s balloon still lingers low, its employee growth has stalled.
                            Larger balloons indicate that hiring has likely been fuelled by investors' cash, smaller balloons high in the graph hint at revenue-driven staff growth.

Disclosed funding
This build-up graph gives an overview of disclosed funding rounds in chronological order, indicating the time and type of funding raised.
Why does it matter?
The size and frequency of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed. Experienced investors look at the size, number and timing of funding rounds in a given industry, and estimate the value of a startup,
                            as well as the amount of equity that founders have likely surrendered. Funding reflects investor confidence in the market, the business, and the team.


Ok, thanks












 








Valuation, Funderbeam estimate
This graph shows a given startup's valuation at different disclosed funding rounds. We approximate the post-money valuation by estimating the value range of the equity stake that the startup may have surrendered to investors in each disclosed funding round.
Why does it matter?
Investors usually want to avoid overpaying for an equity stake in a startup. Comparing startup valuations in the same industry segment helps you read the mood and maturity of the market, investors' exit potential, etc. It also helps you see if a startup prices itself above or below its competitors, considering its product, development stage, etc.
A startup's precise value is impossible to estimate, partly because parties rarely disclose the percentage of the company that's surrendered to investors in any given funding round. However, we can estimate a likely value range based on how startup investments usually work.


Ok, thanks












 








Relative funding history
This graph gives competitors a common starting point, making it easier to view their speed of growth in relation to one another.


Ok, thanks






















Funding history
This graph makes it easy to see and compare the pace of funding among competitors. As a rule, later rounds mean that a company's business model works. This helps to gauge when business in a given sector really took off.


Ok, thanks
