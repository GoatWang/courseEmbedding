Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Theodore Lyons Stern24 Joliet StDyer, IN 46311(219) 864-2077No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Stern, Rachel L601 Gateway Blvd NChesterton, IN 46304(219) 921-1444Physicians & Surgeons, PodiatristsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Stern, Rachel L1550 S Woodland AveMichigan City, IN 46360(219) 921-1444Physicians & Surgeons, PodiatristsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. DR Theodore E Schafer MD333 Dixie HwyChicago Heights, IL 60411(708) 709-6200Physicians & Surgeons, GynecologyServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Stern, Rachel810 Michael DrChesterton, IN 46304(219) 921-1366Physicians & Surgeons, PodiatristsBusinesses in related categories to Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Neurology Associates of NWI1551 Sturdy RdValparaiso, IN 46383(219) 386-4106Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoFrom Business: We welcome new patients ages 6 years and up.
