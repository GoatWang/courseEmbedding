Improving customer experience in an increasingly interconnected world.
With over 5 million new devices interconnected daily, you have a growing challenge to manage your operations, deliver new services, and improve user experience all while reducing operational costs.  Business as usual is not going to cut it—a new approach is required.  You are now responsible for delivering a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for millions of wireless devices. To help, VelociData focuses on the Four C’s of IoT for Operational Management™:
Capture 

Current solutions provide little visibility into Wi-Fi gateways and no visibility into the connected devices
The VelociData Raptor captures the bulk telemetry from these devices and allows you to see, in real-time, your customer’s QoE

Curate 

The vastly different and large numbers of gateways and connected devices creates an untenable amount of data to normalize, filter, store, and scrub
The VelociData Raptor is able to render this data to manageable levels on the fly, saving you time and money

Correlate

All of this data requires systems to understand, match, and align features
The VelociData Raptor adds context and highlights connected events from raw information providing your support team with highly relevant information

Command

With hyper-growth in the number of customer Wi-Fi devices, taking proactive and responsive action for each individual customer is currently not feasible
The VelociData Raptor allows you to control and automate different actions to proactively improve customer QoE and keep your support team focused on business-critical initiatives





VelociData for the Final Hop
Commanding Real-Time Actions on Wi-Fi Gateways in Massive Networks

Providers are aggressively delivering Wi-Fi gateways
Over 5.5 million new devices attaching daily [Gartner 2016]
Wi-Fi issues are escalating, increasing cost and impacting customer QoE
Effective diagnosis requires history from both customer gateways and each connected Wi-Fi device
Automation requires real-time decisions
We solve this Big Data problem with the VelociData Raptor






VelociData provides a platform that enables you to:

Diagnose customer in-home Wi-Fi problems and automate remedies and actions
Use cable modem and CMTS/CCAP data to isolate cable
plant problems
Enable Big Data analytics to solve network issues before they degrade performance
Efficiently improve plant performance to enable DOCSIS 3.1 high-bandwidth rollout
Enable the correlation of content, plant conditions, and network state to identify service issues before they impact customers

Velocidata






























About Us




VelociData was formed in 2012 to bring its innovative streaming compute technology to the enterprise market. Proven in financial markets throughout the world and backed by more than 40 US patents, VelociData’s products are the first of their kind in the marketplace. With the ability to capture, and operate on massive amounts of data, as the data is flowing,  without slowing the data down we open up game changing approaches to gaining insight and driving actions. These new stream computing paradigms allow new approaches in integrating real time data, capturing source information from huge network environments and quickly diagnosing issues and deriving automated actions. Rather than landing and post processing data stores to gain valuable insights, VelociData allows for immediate insights to be derived, and actions to be defined and automated. In an environment in which the sources of data, and the data itself is exponentially growing the old techniques of landing and post processing data will simply not scale. Real time stream computing will become the only realistic means to gain immediate value from data and not be overwhelmed by the unstoppable growth. VelociData is here to help make the move into this new reality easy and successful.

Why Chris Galvin loves startup VelociData


The whiteboard beside Chris O'Malley's desk, next to drawings of Jesus and Ronald Reagan, includes the names of dozens of America's largest corporations. It seems like a pie-in-the-sky list of sales prospects considering that Mr. O'Malley's company, VelociData Inc., has just six employees in its River North headquarters. Yet several of these giants, including WellPoint Inc. and American Express Co., already are customers, each paying the startup $95,000 a month for its flagship data-processing product, zFusion. Why? Because big companies can generate more than 10 billion data points per day, and their own mainframes are ill-equipped to quickly translate those inputs into meaningful analysis. VelociData targets a section of the big-data continuum called extraction, transformation and loading. It brings data from disparate sources and formats them harmoniously so that analytics programs can parse them effectively. Indianapolis-based health insurer WellPoint Inc. required up to 16 hours to sync certain patient data across its network. The problem partly was due to different systems used by its various Blue Cross & Blue Shield subsidiaries. With zFusion, the process takes less than a minute. “I'm used to selling products that are maybe 15 percent or 30 percent better than what people are used to,” says Mr. O'Malley, 51. “I'm not used to this — something that's better by an order of magnitude.”
'RIFLE SHOT'
Mr. O'Malley spent 24 years at software maker CA Inc. of Islandia, New York, working his way up to CEO of one of its acquired companies, Nimsoft Inc. In 2012, he left and joined VelociData's board. He became VelociData's CEO last July, just as VelociData announced the receipt of $10 million from three investors, including former Motorola Inc. CEO Chris Galvin.“It took me 45 minutes to say I'd be in,” Mr. Galvin said. “VelociData may be a niche product, but it's a rifle shot that can ease the data bottleneck.”VelociData's hybrid hardware-plus-software solution was developed at Washington University in St. Louis and first applied to high-frequency trading through St. Louis-based Exegy Inc. VelociData spun out of Exegy in 2011. The core intellectual property was transferred to VelociData, and Exegy now essentially is a VelociData customer. VelociData's 20-person engineering team still is based in St. Louis, but Mr. O'Malley moved its head office to Chicago in November. Analysts are impressed by the company's technology.“The thing that surprises me more than anything else isn't that VelociData has done this; it's that more people haven't tried,” says IT industry analyst Robin Bloor, founder of Bloor Research in London. VelociData has little direct competition, Mr. Bloor says, though IBM Corp.'s PureData product has similar underlying technology and could evolve into a competitor. PureData is based on technology developed by Netezza Corp., which Armonk, New York-based IBM purchased for $1.78 billion in 2010. That means Mr. O'Malley might have to act fast. But that's already VelociData's overall ethos. Speed, after all, is pretty much the point.
