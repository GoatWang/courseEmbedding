Where?My current locationSearchHomeDental Hygienists near Yukon, OKDavid Deason DDS IncServicesDavid Deason DDS Inc415 E Main St Ste 4, Yukon, OK 73099(405) 354-4802View Business DetailsServices"Fish and Chips" found in 1 dishDentists ImplantsDental ImplantsDental implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat virtually anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours will be preserved. The implants are tiny titanium posts that are placed into the jawbone where teeth are missing. The bone bonds with the titanium, creating a strong foundation for artificial teeth. In addition, dental implants can help preserve facial structure, preventing the bone deterioration that occurs when teeth are missing.RestorativeBridgesDental bridges are highly durable and will last many years, however, they may need replacement or need to be re-cemented due to normal wear.Restorative DentistryDental BondingFillingsDeason Dental offers both composite (tooth-colored) fillings and amalgam (silver/metal) fillings. There are benefits to both, and each can be used depending upon your particular dental health and oral needs. There are many types of filling materials available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Composite fillings, along with silver amalgam fillings, are the most widely used today.  You and Dr. Deason can discuss the best options for restoring your teeth.VeneersPorcelain veneers, often alternatively referred to as dental veneers or dental porcelain laminates, are wafer-thin shells of porcelain which are bonded onto the front side of teeth to make a cosmetic improvement in their appearance. Porcelain veneers are routinely used to idealize teeth that are discolored, worn, chipped, or misaligned.CrownsIf you're self-conscious about cracked, broken, decayed, or worn teeth, we can bring back your healthy, natural-looking smile with dental crowns, also referred to as caps. A crown can return structure, strength, and function to a tooth with extensive decay or damage. Designed to fit securely and function as a healthy tooth, a crown will protect your tooth from further damage and preserve the jaw's correct natural alignment.EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentWhen restoration procedures such as root canal therapy, crowns, or fillings are not enough to save a tooth, it may need to be pulled, or extracted.ProsthodonticsDenturesPartial dentures are recommended when a few or more of your natural teeth remain in the upper or lower jaw. A partial denture, sometimes known as a bridge, has the replacement teeth attached to a pink or gum-colored plastic base and is connected to a metal framework that holds the denture in the mouth. You can easily remove the gum-colored plastic by the base for brushing or flossing.GeneralTeeth WhiteningDeason Dental has options available for whitening if you are unhappy with the color of your teeth. We offer the newest Crest Whitestrips—80% stronger than what you can buy over the counter. These provide a more effective and efficient way to make your smile brighter.Cosmetic DentistryPreventiveTeeth CleaningDr. Deason believes in personalized service in all areas of his practice, including professional dental cleanings [dental prophylaxis]. He will do a complete oral exam as well as the following...DiagnosticOral Cancer ScreeningAn oral cancer screening exam screening will be done during your routine dental visit. Dr. Deason will look over the inside of your mouth, checking for red or white patches or mouth sores as well as lumps and abnormalities.Dental ExaminationThe best way to preserve the health of your teeth and gums is to maintain a sensible oral hygiene regimen. In addition to daily brushing and flossing, this includes regular dental examinations and professional cleanings.X-raysDental x-rays are diagnostic tools that are essential and preventative in providing valuable information not visible during a regular dental exam.  Dentists and dental hygienists use this information to safely and accurately detect hidden dental abnormalities and complete an accurate treatment plan.  Without x-rays, problem areas may go undetected.Oral and Maxillofacial SurgeryOral SurgeryIn addition to these recommendations for self-care, Dr. Deason offers more advanced treatment options for patients who suffer from TMJ pain. Patients may be fitted for an oral appliance, which will help ease stress on the joint. These appliances are worn at night to prevent patients from grinding their teeth during sleep. Dr. Deason will also evaluate the condition and placement of the teeth, and may perform various dental procedures, such as replacing missing teeth, to correct a patient’s tooth alignment and bite. In the most serious of TMJ disorder cases, Dr. Deason may advise patients to undergo oral surgery. While this is a last resort option, it can significantly reduce TMJ pain and prevent further damage to the temporomandibular joint.Tooth ExtractionsTooth extraction procedures today are far less painful than ever before, thanks to powerful anesthetics and sedatives. In many cases, a patient who has a tooth removed experiences little or no discomfort, and only minor bleeding.Send to PhoneDavid Deason DDS Inc415 E Main St Ste 4, Yukon, OK 73099(405) 354-4802Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailDavid Deason DDS Inc415 E Main St Ste 4, Yukon, OK 73099(405) 354-4802Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
