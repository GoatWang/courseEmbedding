James Meeks Jr., passed away on September 2, 2015. Born on March 10, 1931 in York, South Carolina, he was preceded in death by his father Hugh J. Meeks and mother Fleater E. Meeks.
He retired from Preston Trucking Company after many years of service where he was a member of the Teamsters Union 822.
He gave his life to Christ at an early age and before his illness, he was a member of Saint Thomas AME Zion Church, located in Norfolk, Virginia where he served faithfully.
He enjoyed outdoors; fishing and hunting were his main hobbies and he served as the President of the Whaleyville  Hunt Club at one time.
He loved to play baseball when he was younger. If you were looking for him at home you could find him working on all kinds of mechanical things in his garage and most of all, you would find him working in his garden. He loved to see vegetables grow and he also loved to eat them.
H leaves behind his beloved wife of 62 years, Thelma M. Meeks. He also leaves to cherish his memory six children; Ronnie Meeks of Chesapeake, Virginia, Bobby Meeks of Bowie, Maryland, Patricia Leaven of Chesapeake, Virginia, Deborah Meeks of Portsmouth, Virginia, Dennis Meeks (Suzette) of Suffolk, Virginia, James E. Meeks of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; ten grandchildren; eight great grandchildren, nieces, nephews and a host of relatives and friends.
