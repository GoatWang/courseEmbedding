What are analysts saying about US Foods Holding Corp stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about US Foods Holding Corp stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "US Foods Holding Corp. is a foodservice distributor. The company serves independent and multi-unit restaurants, healthcare and hospitality entities, government and educational institutions. US Foods Holding Corp. is headquartered in Rosemont, Ill.   " (7/19/2017)
2. Pivotal Research analysts commented, "After the market close yesterday, Bohai announced that its Board of Directors have approved the deal to purchase C2, which is CIT’s aircraft leasing company, and released the Significant Asset Purchase Report." The company will hold a shareholders meeting at 2:30 p.m. on March 6, 2017 (Shenzhen, China time) to vote for the deal." (2/16/2017)
3. Guggenheim analysts commented, "We remain Buy-rated with a $30 PT and an expectation of 10-15% annual returns over the next several years. Our moderate growth thesis revolves around the 'triangle of value creation,' which is alive and well. With EBITDA growing $90-100M a year and debt reduction approximating $200M annually, we believe the shares could appreciate 10-15% per year even with modest multiple compression. As detailed in Exhibit 1, our $30 PT is predicated on a 10x EBITDA multiple on our 2017E EBITDA, a reasonable expectation for a business operating with a favorable competitive backdrop and no e-commerce vulnerability." (2/16/2017)
4. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We reiterate our Outperform rating, and continue to see favorable risk/reward with long-term opportunities intact and shares trading at a -16% valuation gap vs. SYY.  Q4 caps a strong FY16. USFD wrapped up its first FY as a newly public company with a strong FY16 and Q4 results that largely matched USFD’s preannounced results on January 13 th . Highlights include: 1) FY16 Adjusted EBITDA growth of +11%, or +12.5% normalized for a 53 rd week in FY15; 2) Accelerating Q4 independent case growth of +6.1%, with an organic contribution of +3.8% suggesting underlying trends (on a 2-year basis) improved +60bps; 3) Annual gross margin improvement of +60bps owing to improved customer mix (more independents, fewer chains), merchandising/procurement initiatives and pricing benefits from deflation; and 4) FY16 gross profit dollar growth exceeding operating expense growth by 180bps. Looking ahead to FY17, we anticipate this spread to widen to +300bps as gross margin drivers continue and the benefits from recent field reorganization and restructuring initiatives are expected to drive +25bps of Adj. EBITDA margin improvement." (2/15/2017)
5. Royal Bank Of Canada analysts commented, "We are initiating on US Foods with an Outperform rating and $32 price target. With a gross margin profile that has more closely mirrored the industry's top-line deceleration and increasing wage pressure, US Foods is appropriately positioned to gain market share. With less wage increase exposure, greater e-commerce retention, and greater value-added product offerings, we believe the EV/NTM EBITDA valuation discount to peers is unwarranted." (1/24/2017)
