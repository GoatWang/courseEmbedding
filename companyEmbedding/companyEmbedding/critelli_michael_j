Background[edit]
Michael grew up in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Bishop Kearney High School in 1966 and the University of Wisconsin with a B.A. in political science and communications in 1970. He graduated from the Harvard Law School with a J.D. cum laude in 1974.
Pre-CEO career[edit]
Prior to joining Pitney Bowes as a Counsel in 1979, he was an associate at two Chicago law firms. At Pitney Bowes, he became the Company’s General Counsel in 1988 and added responsibility for its human resources functions in 1990, functions he jointly led until 1993.
As chief HR officer, he created and sustained an employer-sponsored healthcare program, and was featured by Professor Michael Porter in Redefining Healthcare, co-authored with Professor Elizabeth Teisberg, and a 2009 Harvard Business School study.[1][2] Critelli presented the program at the World Economic Forum in 2007 and 2008.[3]
Tenure as CEO[edit]
Critelli became the Company’s CEO during a period in which the Company and the mailing industry underwent transformational change.
Under him, Pitney Bowes was named one of America’s most ethical companies.[4]
The Company transitioned its entire installed equipment base from electromechanical and electronic technology to digital, networked systems between 1996 and 2007. It was ranked as one of America’s most innovative companies and in the top 200 of patents issued during Critelli’s tenure.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] He was awarded 15 U.S. patents that arose during his tenure at Pitney Bowes.[17]
In 2001, Critelli and Jim Euchner, his leader of Advanced Concepts and Technologies, launched a customer-centered process incorporated into major product development initiatives. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School recognized this as a leading-edge innovation process.[18]
Pitney Bowes exited its office systems and external finance businesses and completed over 80 acquisitions to build strength in software, services and international operations. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic investments, the Company diversified into adjacent “mail stream” market spaces.[19]
Mail volumes, which had continued to grow into the 2000’s, finally flattened out later in Critelli's tenure,[20] and dropped precipitously as a result of the drop in consumer credit after the 2008 financial crisis, as noted in a Boston Consulting Group Study [21]
Industry leadership[edit]
Between 2001 and 2005, Critelli co-led the Mailing Industry Task Force,[22][23] along with Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to work with the private sector on a variety of initiatives, and was heavily used as an industry spokesperson during the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incidents.
He also chaired the Mailing Industry CEO Council, which was an advocate for comprehensive postal reform, an effort resulting in the passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006.[24]
Leadership style[edit]
Critelli used levers such as compensation structure, skip-level meetings, town hall meetings, talent management and accessibility.
Community and public service activity[edit]
Pitney Bowes has been recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion, leadership development, health promotion and ethical leadership for many decades, starting with the Company’s most significant leader, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr., continuing under the leadership of Fred T. Allen and George B. Harvey, and built on during Critelli’s tenure.[25] Critelli chaired the Company’s 1993-1994 United Way Campaign, which won the Spirit of America Award.[26]
Critelli chaired two public-private task forces on transportation management, one in 1991-1993 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker [27] and one in 2007-2008 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell.[28] He was a participant in the formulation of Connecticut’s broad transportation strategy between 1987 and 2008.
Critelli was a Board member (1997-2010) and Chair of the National Urban League (2002-2007) and a member of the Board of Catalyst, an organization dedicated to expanding opportunities for women at work from 1996 to 2009.[29]
He supported many educational initiatives, including co-leadership of the Connect 96 program between 1995 and 1996 to outfit every Connecticut school and library with Internet service. During his tenure, the Company created an Education and Literacy Foundation to focus Pitney Bowes philanthropy on education, literacy and learning programs.[30]
He was a member of the Connecticut Sustinet Health Board and chaired its Prevention Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on state healthcare reform legislation and regulations.[31]
Post-retirement activity[edit]
In December 2010, he became the President and CEO of the Dossia Service Corporation, an organization he co-founded, along with Craig Barrett, then the Chairman and CEO of Intel Corporation, and senior leaders of eight other Fortune 500 companies. Dossia is a software and technology firm for consumer-driven healthcare.[32]
Crtielli was a producer of the full-length feature film From the Rough,[33] starring Taraji P. Henson. Screenplay was written by Michael A. Critelli (son). Director and co-producers were Pierre Bagley and Peter Graves.[34][35] The film was based on the true story of Dr. Catana Starks,[36] the first African-American woman to coach a men’s college athletic team. It was released nationwide theatrically in 2014 and is available in ancillary domestic and international markets.[37][38]
For-profit board of director and advisory positions[edit]
He has been a member of the Board of Eaton Corporation, a leading global power management company, since 1998.[39] In 2012, he also became a member of the Board of ProHealth Physicians, Inc., the largest primary care physician services organization in New England.[40]
He is currently a member of the North American Advisory Boards of Alexander Proudfoot, a firm which helps companies better execute their plans and strategies to deliver substantial improvements in performance and profitability [41] and CVC Capital Partners, one of the world’s leading private equity firms.[42]
Non-profit board and advisory positions[edit]
He is a member of the advisory boards of RAND Health [43] and the Yale School of Public Health.[44]
He is a member of the Connecticut Affiliate of Social Venture Partners.[45]
He is a Vice Chair of the Board of the Regional Plan Association, a tri-state organization, the mission of which is to improve the New York metropolitan region’s economic health, environmental sustainability and quality of life through research, planning and advocacy.[46]

Harvey, and built on during Critelli’s tenure.[25] Critelli chaired the Company’s 1993-1994 United Way Campaign, which won the Spirit of America Award.[26]
Critelli chaired two public-private task forces on transportation management, one in 1991-1993 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker [27] and one in 2007-2008 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell.[28] He was a participant in the formulation of Connecticut’s broad transportation strategy between 1987 and 2008.
Critelli was a Board member (1997-2010) and Chair of the National Urban League (2002-2007) and a member of the Board of Catalyst, an organization dedicated to expanding opportunities for women at work from 1996 to 2009.[29]
He supported many educational initiatives, including co-leadership of the Connect 96 program between 1995 and 1996 to outfit every Connecticut school and library with Internet service. During his tenure, the Company created an Education and Literacy Foundation to focus Pitney Bowes philanthropy on education, literacy and learning programs.[30]
He was a member of the Connecticut Sustinet Health Board and chaired its Prevention Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on state healthcare reform legislation and regulations.[31]
Post-retirement activity[edit]
In December 2010, he became the President and CEO of the Dossia Service Corporation, an organization he co-founded, along with Craig Barrett, then the Chairman and CEO of Intel Corporation, and senior leaders of eight other Fortune 500 companies. Dossia is a software and technology firm for consumer-driven healthcare.[32]
Crtielli was a producer of the full-length feature film From the Rough,[33] starring Taraji P. Henson. Screenplay was written by Michael A. Critelli (son). Director and co-producers were Pierre Bagley and Peter Graves.[34][35] The film was based on the true story of Dr. Catana Starks,[36] the first African-American woman to coach a men’s college athletic team. It was released nationwide theatrically in 2014 and is available in ancillary domestic and international markets.[37][38]
For-profit board of director and advisory positions[edit]
He has been a member of the Board of Eaton Corporation, a leading global power management company, since 1998.[39] In 2012, he also became a member of the Board of ProHealth Physicians, Inc., the largest primary care physician services organization in New England.[40]
He is currently a member of the North American Advisory Boards of Alexander Proudfoot, a firm which helps companies better execute their plans and strategies to deliver substantial improvements in performance and profitability [41] and CVC Capital Partners, one of the world’s leading private equity firms.[42]

Background[edit]
Michael grew up in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Bishop Kearney High School in 1966 and the University of Wisconsin with a B.A. in political science and communications in 1970. He graduated from the Harvard Law School with a J.D. cum laude in 1974.
Pre-CEO career[edit]
Prior to joining Pitney Bowes as a Counsel in 1979, he was an associate at two Chicago law firms. At Pitney Bowes, he became the Company’s General Counsel in 1988 and added responsibility for its human resources functions in 1990, functions he jointly led until 1993.
As chief HR officer, he created and sustained an employer-sponsored healthcare program, and was featured by Professor Michael Porter in Redefining Healthcare, co-authored with Professor Elizabeth Teisberg, and a 2009 Harvard Business School study.[1][2] Critelli presented the program at the World Economic Forum in 2007 and 2008.[3]
Tenure as CEO[edit]
Critelli became the Company’s CEO during a period in which the Company and the mailing industry underwent transformational change.
Under him, Pitney Bowes was named one of America’s most ethical companies.[4]
The Company transitioned its entire installed equipment base from electromechanical and electronic technology to digital, networked systems between 1996 and 2007. It was ranked as one of America’s most innovative companies and in the top 200 of patents issued during Critelli’s tenure.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] He was awarded 15 U.S. patents that arose during his tenure at Pitney Bowes.[17]
In 2001, Critelli and Jim Euchner, his leader of Advanced Concepts and Technologies, launched a customer-centered process incorporated into major product development initiatives. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School recognized this as a leading-edge innovation process.[18]
Pitney Bowes exited its office systems and external finance businesses and completed over 80 acquisitions to build strength in software, services and international operations. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic investments, the Company diversified into adjacent “mail stream” market spaces.[19]
Mail volumes, which had continued to grow into the 2000’s, finally flattened out later in Critelli's tenure,[20] and dropped precipitously as a result of the drop in consumer credit after the 2008 financial crisis, as noted in a Boston Consulting Group Study [21]
Industry leadership[edit]
Between 2001 and 2005, Critelli co-led the Mailing Industry Task Force,[22][23] along with Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to work with the private sector on a variety of initiatives, and was heavily used as an industry spokesperson during the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incidents.
He also chaired the Mailing Industry CEO Council, which was an advocate for comprehensive postal reform, an effort resulting in the passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006.[24]
Leadership style[edit]
Critelli used levers such as compensation structure, skip-level meetings, town hall meetings, talent management and accessibility.
Community and public service activity[edit]
Pitney Bowes has been recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion, leadership development, health promotion and ethical leadership for many decades, starting with the Company’s most significant leader, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr., continuing under the leadership of Fred T. Allen and George B. Harvey, and built on during Critelli’s tenure.[25] Critelli chaired the Company’s 1993-1994 United Way Campaign, which won the Spirit of America Award.[26]

He also has a driver of technological innovation, as demonstrated by having received nine U.S. patents for mailing technology. He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and the Harvard Law School.

Background[edit]
Michael grew up in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Bishop Kearney High School in 1966 and the University of Wisconsin with a B.A. in political science and communications in 1970. He graduated from the Harvard Law School with a J.D. cum laude in 1974.
Pre-CEO career[edit]
Prior to joining Pitney Bowes as a Counsel in 1979, he was an associate at two Chicago law firms. At Pitney Bowes, he became the Company’s General Counsel in 1988 and added responsibility for its human resources functions in 1990, functions he jointly led until 1993.
As chief HR officer, he created and sustained an employer-sponsored healthcare program, and was featured by Professor Michael Porter in Redefining Healthcare, co-authored with Professor Elizabeth Teisberg, and a 2009 Harvard Business School study.[1][2] Critelli presented the program at the World Economic Forum in 2007 and 2008.[3]
Tenure as CEO[edit]
Critelli became the Company’s CEO during a period in which the Company and the mailing industry underwent transformational change.
Under him, Pitney Bowes was named one of America’s most ethical companies.[4]
The Company transitioned its entire installed equipment base from electromechanical and electronic technology to digital, networked systems between 1996 and 2007. It was ranked as one of America’s most innovative companies and in the top 200 of patents issued during Critelli’s tenure.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] He was awarded 15 U.S. patents that arose during his tenure at Pitney Bowes.[17]
In 2001, Critelli and Jim Euchner, his leader of Advanced Concepts and Technologies, launched a customer-centered process incorporated into major product development initiatives. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School recognized this as a leading-edge innovation process.[18]
Pitney Bowes exited its office systems and external finance businesses and completed over 80 acquisitions to build strength in software, services and international operations. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic investments, the Company diversified into adjacent “mail stream” market spaces.[19]
Mail volumes, which had continued to grow into the 2000’s, finally flattened out later in Critelli's tenure,[20] and dropped precipitously as a result of the drop in consumer credit after the 2008 financial crisis, as noted in a Boston Consulting Group Study [21]
Industry leadership[edit]
Between 2001 and 2005, Critelli co-led the Mailing Industry Task Force,[22][23] along with Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to work with the private sector on a variety of initiatives, and was heavily used as an industry spokesperson during the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incidents.
He also chaired the Mailing Industry CEO Council, which was an advocate for comprehensive postal reform, an effort resulting in the passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006.[24]
Leadership style[edit]
Critelli used levers such as compensation structure, skip-level meetings, town hall meetings, talent management and accessibility.
Community and public service activity[edit]
Pitney Bowes has been recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion, leadership development, health promotion and ethical leadership for many decades, starting with the Company’s most significant leader, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr., continuing under the leadership of Fred T. Allen and George B. Harvey, and built on during Critelli’s tenure.[25] Critelli chaired the Company’s 1993-1994 United Way Campaign, which won the Spirit of America Award.[26]
Critelli chaired two public-private task forces on transportation management, one in 1991-1993 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker [27] and one in 2007-2008 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell.[28] He was a participant in the formulation of Connecticut’s broad transportation strategy between 1987 and 2008.
Critelli was a Board member (1997-2010) and Chair of the National Urban League (2002-2007) and a member of the Board of Catalyst, an organization dedicated to expanding opportunities for women at work from 1996 to 2009.[29]
He supported many educational initiatives, including co-leadership of the Connect 96 program between 1995 and 1996 to outfit every Connecticut school and library with Internet service. During his tenure, the Company created an Education and Literacy Foundation to focus Pitney Bowes philanthropy on education, literacy and learning programs.[30]
He was a member of the Connecticut Sustinet Health Board and chaired its Prevention Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on state healthcare reform legislation and regulations.[31]
Post-retirement activity[edit]
In December 2010, he became the President and CEO of the Dossia Service Corporation, an organization he co-founded, along with Craig Barrett, then the Chairman and CEO of Intel Corporation, and senior leaders of eight other Fortune 500 companies. Dossia is a software and technology firm for consumer-driven healthcare.[32]
Crtielli was a producer of the full-length feature film From the Rough,[33] starring Taraji P. Henson. Screenplay was written by Michael A. Critelli (son). Director and co-producers were Pierre Bagley and Peter Graves.[34][35] The film was based on the true story of Dr. Catana Starks,[36] the first African-American woman to coach a men’s college athletic team. It was released nationwide theatrically in 2014 and is available in ancillary domestic and international markets.[37][38]

Background[edit]
Michael grew up in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Bishop Kearney High School in 1966 and the University of Wisconsin with a B.A. in political science and communications in 1970. He graduated from the Harvard Law School with a J.D. cum laude in 1974.
Pre-CEO career[edit]
Prior to joining Pitney Bowes as a Counsel in 1979, he was an associate at two Chicago law firms. At Pitney Bowes, he became the Company’s General Counsel in 1988 and added responsibility for its human resources functions in 1990, functions he jointly led until 1993.
As chief HR officer, he created and sustained an employer-sponsored healthcare program, and was featured by Professor Michael Porter in Redefining Healthcare, co-authored with Professor Elizabeth Teisberg, and a 2009 Harvard Business School study.[1][2] Critelli presented the program at the World Economic Forum in 2007 and 2008.[3]
Tenure as CEO[edit]
Critelli became the Company’s CEO during a period in which the Company and the mailing industry underwent transformational change.
Under him, Pitney Bowes was named one of America’s most ethical companies.[4]
The Company transitioned its entire installed equipment base from electromechanical and electronic technology to digital, networked systems between 1996 and 2007. It was ranked as one of America’s most innovative companies and in the top 200 of patents issued during Critelli’s tenure.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] He was awarded 15 U.S. patents that arose during his tenure at Pitney Bowes.[17]
In 2001, Critelli and Jim Euchner, his leader of Advanced Concepts and Technologies, launched a customer-centered process incorporated into major product development initiatives. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School recognized this as a leading-edge innovation process.[18]
Pitney Bowes exited its office systems and external finance businesses and completed over 80 acquisitions to build strength in software, services and international operations. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic investments, the Company diversified into adjacent “mail stream” market spaces.[19]
Mail volumes, which had continued to grow into the 2000’s, finally flattened out later in Critelli's tenure,[20] and dropped precipitously as a result of the drop in consumer credit after the 2008 financial crisis, as noted in a Boston Consulting Group Study [21]
Industry leadership[edit]
Between 2001 and 2005, Critelli co-led the Mailing Industry Task Force,[22][23] along with Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to work with the private sector on a variety of initiatives, and was heavily used as an industry spokesperson during the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incidents.
He also chaired the Mailing Industry CEO Council, which was an advocate for comprehensive postal reform, an effort resulting in the passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006.[24]
Leadership style[edit]
Critelli used levers such as compensation structure, skip-level meetings, town hall meetings, talent management and accessibility.
Community and public service activity[edit]
Pitney Bowes has been recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion, leadership development, health promotion and ethical leadership for many decades, starting with the Company’s most significant leader, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr., continuing under the leadership of Fred T. Allen and George B. Harvey, and built on during Critelli’s tenure.[25] Critelli chaired the Company’s 1993-1994 United Way Campaign, which won the Spirit of America Award.[26]
Critelli chaired two public-private task forces on transportation management, one in 1991-1993 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker [27] and one in 2007-2008 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell.[28] He was a participant in the formulation of Connecticut’s broad transportation strategy between 1987 and 2008.
Critelli was a Board member (1997-2010) and Chair of the National Urban League (2002-2007) and a member of the Board of Catalyst, an organization dedicated to expanding opportunities for women at work from 1996 to 2009.[29]
He supported many educational initiatives, including co-leadership of the Connect 96 program between 1995 and 1996 to outfit every Connecticut school and library with Internet service. During his tenure, the Company created an Education and Literacy Foundation to focus Pitney Bowes philanthropy on education, literacy and learning programs.[30]
He was a member of the Connecticut Sustinet Health Board and chaired its Prevention Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on state healthcare reform legislation and regulations.[31]
Post-retirement activity[edit]
In December 2010, he became the President and CEO of the Dossia Service Corporation, an organization he co-founded, along with Craig Barrett, then the Chairman and CEO of Intel Corporation, and senior leaders of eight other Fortune 500 companies. Dossia is a software and technology firm for consumer-driven healthcare.[32]
Crtielli was a producer of the full-length feature film From the Rough,[33] starring Taraji P. Henson. Screenplay was written by Michael A. Critelli (son). Director and co-producers were Pierre Bagley and Peter Graves.[34][35] The film was based on the true story of Dr. Catana Starks,[36] the first African-American woman to coach a men’s college athletic team. It was released nationwide theatrically in 2014 and is available in ancillary domestic and international markets.[37][38]
For-profit board of director and advisory positions[edit]
He has been a member of the Board of Eaton Corporation, a leading global power management company, since 1998.[39] In 2012, he also became a member of the Board of ProHealth Physicians, Inc., the largest primary care physician services organization in New England.[40]
He is currently a member of the North American Advisory Boards of Alexander Proudfoot, a firm which helps companies better execute their plans and strategies to deliver substantial improvements in performance and profitability [41] and CVC Capital Partners, one of the world’s leading private equity firms.[42]
Non-profit board and advisory positions[edit]
He is a member of the advisory boards of RAND Health [43] and the Yale School of Public Health.[44]
He is a member of the Connecticut Affiliate of Social Venture Partners.[45]
He is a Vice Chair of the Board of the Regional Plan Association, a tri-state organization, the mission of which is to improve the New York metropolitan region’s economic health, environmental sustainability and quality of life through research, planning and advocacy.[46]

Background[edit]
Michael grew up in Rochester, New York. He graduated from Bishop Kearney High School in 1966 and the University of Wisconsin with a B.A. in political science and communications in 1970. He graduated from the Harvard Law School with a J.D. cum laude in 1974.
Pre-CEO career[edit]
Prior to joining Pitney Bowes as a Counsel in 1979, he was an associate at two Chicago law firms. At Pitney Bowes, he became the Company’s General Counsel in 1988 and added responsibility for its human resources functions in 1990, functions he jointly led until 1993.
As chief HR officer, he created and sustained an employer-sponsored healthcare program, and was featured by Professor Michael Porter in Redefining Healthcare, co-authored with Professor Elizabeth Teisberg, and a 2009 Harvard Business School study.[1][2] Critelli presented the program at the World Economic Forum in 2007 and 2008.[3]
Tenure as CEO[edit]
Critelli became the Company’s CEO during a period in which the Company and the mailing industry underwent transformational change.
Under him, Pitney Bowes was named one of America’s most ethical companies.[4]
The Company transitioned its entire installed equipment base from electromechanical and electronic technology to digital, networked systems between 1996 and 2007. It was ranked as one of America’s most innovative companies and in the top 200 of patents issued during Critelli’s tenure.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] He was awarded 15 U.S. patents that arose during his tenure at Pitney Bowes.[17]
In 2001, Critelli and Jim Euchner, his leader of Advanced Concepts and Technologies, launched a customer-centered process incorporated into major product development initiatives. Clayton Christensen of the Harvard Business School recognized this as a leading-edge innovation process.[18]
Pitney Bowes exited its office systems and external finance businesses and completed over 80 acquisitions to build strength in software, services and international operations. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic investments, the Company diversified into adjacent “mail stream” market spaces.[19]
Mail volumes, which had continued to grow into the 2000’s, finally flattened out later in Critelli's tenure,[20] and dropped precipitously as a result of the drop in consumer credit after the 2008 financial crisis, as noted in a Boston Consulting Group Study [21]
Industry leadership[edit]
Between 2001 and 2005, Critelli co-led the Mailing Industry Task Force,[22][23] along with Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan, to enable the U.S. Postal Service to work with the private sector on a variety of initiatives, and was heavily used as an industry spokesperson during the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incidents.
He also chaired the Mailing Industry CEO Council, which was an advocate for comprehensive postal reform, an effort resulting in the passage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006.[24]
Leadership style[edit]
Critelli used levers such as compensation structure, skip-level meetings, town hall meetings, talent management and accessibility.
Community and public service activity[edit]
Pitney Bowes has been recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion, leadership development, health promotion and ethical leadership for many decades, starting with the Company’s most significant leader, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr., continuing under the leadership of Fred T. Allen and George B. Harvey, and built on during Critelli’s tenure.[25] Critelli chaired the Company’s 1993-1994 United Way Campaign, which won the Spirit of America Award.[26]
Critelli chaired two public-private task forces on transportation management, one in 1991-1993 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor Lowell Weicker [27] and one in 2007-2008 as an appointee of Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell.[28] He was a participant in the formulation of Connecticut’s broad transportation strategy between 1987 and 2008.
Critelli was a Board member (1997-2010) and Chair of the National Urban League (2002-2007) and a member of the Board of Catalyst, an organization dedicated to expanding opportunities for women at work from 1996 to 2009.[29]
He supported many educational initiatives, including co-leadership of the Connect 96 program between 1995 and 1996 to outfit every Connecticut school and library with Internet service. During his tenure, the Company created an Education and Literacy Foundation to focus Pitney Bowes philanthropy on education, literacy and learning programs.[30]
He was a member of the Connecticut Sustinet Health Board and chaired its Prevention Advisory Committee to review and make recommendations on state healthcare reform legislation and regulations.[31]
Post-retirement activity[edit]
In December 2010, he became the President and CEO of the Dossia Service Corporation, an organization he co-founded, along with Craig Barrett, then the Chairman and CEO of Intel Corporation, and senior leaders of eight other Fortune 500 companies. Dossia is a software and technology firm for consumer-driven healthcare.[32]
Crtielli was a producer of the full-length feature film From the Rough,[33] starring Taraji P. Henson. Screenplay was written by Michael A. Critelli (son). Director and co-producers were Pierre Bagley and Peter Graves.[34][35] The film was based on the true story of Dr. Catana Starks,[36] the first African-American woman to coach a men’s college athletic team. It was released nationwide theatrically in 2014 and is available in ancillary domestic and international markets.[37][38]
For-profit board of director and advisory positions[edit]
He has been a member of the Board of Eaton Corporation, a leading global power management company, since 1998.[39] In 2012, he also became a member of the Board of ProHealth Physicians, Inc., the largest primary care physician services organization in New England.[40]
He is currently a member of the North American Advisory Boards of Alexander Proudfoot, a firm which helps companies better execute their plans and strategies to deliver substantial improvements in performance and profitability [41] and CVC Capital Partners, one of the world’s leading private equity firms.[42]
Non-profit board and advisory positions[edit]
He is a member of the advisory boards of RAND Health [43] and the Yale School of Public Health.[44]
He is a member of the Connecticut Affiliate of Social Venture Partners.[45]
He is a Vice Chair of the Board of the Regional Plan Association, a tri-state organization, the mission of which is to improve the New York metropolitan region’s economic health, environmental sustainability and quality of life through research, planning and advocacy.[46]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
