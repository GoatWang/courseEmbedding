How Can Remark Help You?
Let's start by eliminating the endless back and forth emails.


Powerful yet easy communication tools for internal and external stakeholders

Time-stamped annotations (text, drawings, voice notes) tied to each video viewing room.
Reply to and discuss the exact Remark with a visual reference, all in one place.









Before Remark, our client feedback process was painful. Convoluted emails referencing timecode don't work. Since adopting Remark over a year ago, our workflow and client satisfaction has dramatically increased. It is without a doubt one of the most powerful tools we have as a production company.


@John Trefry, Founder & CEO at 4WT Media

whatever device and screen size you want to use.

Safari, and countless other modern browsers.










Remark makes collaborating with your clients simple. It‚Äôs intuitive interface makes it really easy to use for our clients and keeps them involved in the production process. The Remark team keeps making this product better and we‚Äôre looking forward to continue using it.

Remark greatly lowers the barriers to working with talented individuals around the world in a distributed
team.










We used the software for a big project that required collaboration between people all across Canada, and I have to say it was a huge success. Everyone said it was the slickest and smoothest collaborative review process they had ever experienced. Nice work!

What are people saying about Remark?















Our company is spread across the nation, we also have clients with limited technical skills and our deadlines are typically extremely tight. Remark has completely revolutionized the way we interact with our teams. Our clients can all view the same video at the same time while commenting in real time. This has sped up our approval process to a matter of hours versus days of emails and possible miscommunication. I can even watch with a client, note their comment and make the change as its happening. It just works.



Eric Crowley

Producer at Farm Journal Broadcast











Milltown is a boutique production company located in Western Massachusetts. Most of my current clients are a mix between corporate industrial and educational institutions. Since introducing Remark HQ to my client review process, workflow has been much more efficient. With the timecode based notes right there in the browser viewing room, clients find it easier to relay notes to me without having to go to a third party cloud site, download videos, and then send me a document with annotated timecode.



Zach MacDonald

Owner at Milltown Productions











Gone are the days of deciphering cryptic client notes. ‚Äúchange that shot after the other one by the yellow fast one.‚Äù Clear and concise communication is key to a good workflow and fast turnaround times. With the ability for our clients to leave time-stamp feedback on a video, Remark has made making revisions to our videos easier. Also, their flat rate pricing puts them above their competitors; I can just upload without having to worry about limits or quotas.

 Is Your Stretch Mark Treatment Effective?

How To Pick A Stretch Mark Treatment¬†That Works
And Get It At A Great Price
With the wealth of information available regarding stretch marks, we decided it was time to write an in depth analysis of what you want to look out for when buying an effective stretch mark treatment.
Most people¬†will develop stretch marks at some time throughout their lives. Stretch marks develop from tears in the dermis layer of the skin, leaving internal scars. Stretch marks form from many factors such as weight fluctuations, growth, pregnancy, and even genetic predisposition. These unsightly imperfections make many people look for ways to get rid of them.¬†As such, many¬†manufacturers materialize with their ‚Äòversion‚Äô of an effective stretch mark treatment, with wild claims as to its actual benefits. As each new company bursts into the market with their own ‚Äòproprietary treatment‚Äô, it becomes harder to separate fact from fiction, premium product from worthless imitation.
We decided it was time to analyze them ourselves to find out which products were sub-par, which were flat-out lying about what was even in their creams, gels and oils, and which, if any, might actually be worth a try.
As we rounded up all of the big brands in the industry, we could see straight off the bat which companies were only there to make a quick buck.

Most stretch mark treatments¬†do not contain what‚Äôs actually on the label and do not treat both the dermis and epidermis layers of the skin.


In addition, we found that most companies who claim to have effective proven ingredients, actually don‚Äôt have. Furthermore, they include many irrelevant extras. This is disheartening and makes it difficult for the consumer to know which manufacturers are lying and which are telling the truth

It‚Äôs hard to believe, but most companies slap on a label that says ‚Äòstretch mark treatment‚Äô, often without even detailing ingredients it contains but also failing to include ingredients proven most effective in the prevention and treatment of stretch marks.

What Did We Research?
With hundreds of manufacturers out there, we wanted to figure out what to look for and how to overcome our concerns regarding stretch mark¬†products. We started the process by making a list of the main concerns we have over buying a good stretch mark treatment.

It‚Äôs not going to be effective. The truth is, there are a lot of products that don‚Äôt work at all. Typically, this is because they don‚Äôt contain the right ingredients or the right proportions. A lot of interested consumers don‚Äôt realize how exact a science creating an effective¬†treatment really is.


It‚Äôs going to be too expensive to afford. As we conducted our research, we found that a lot of companies sell stretch mark treatments¬†for $100 or more! Who wants to risk that kind of money on what could just be snake oil salesmanship?


The company I buy from might just be exploiting uninformed consumers. How can you tell when a manufacturer is just trying to cash in on the latest trend? Most of those companies are all gimmick and no substance. How do you know that the company you choose to buy from is giving you the real deal?

Finding High Quality¬†Stretch Mark Treatments
So, how can you identify the legitimate products through all the smoke? There are a few key factors to look for that can all but guarantee the product is genuine.
1. Third Party Monitoring: Independent monitoring companies track each company‚Äôs reputation and customer satisfaction. One of the most important qualities for a supplement manufacturer is their reputation. Look for a company with a solid reputation backed by third party monitoring.
2. Risk Free Money Back Guarantee: Go with a company that guarantees their product and offers your money back if you aren‚Äôt satisfied. If the company is not willing to put their money where their mouth is, that means they don‚Äôt believe in their own product.
3. Third Party Testing: Different than third party monitoring, third-party testing verifies the quality of each company‚Äôs products. Third party testing is really expensive for manufacturers, since it can actually disqualify entire shipments of products. But when companies don‚Äôt have independent quality control, there is no guarantee that their products are what they claim to be.
Stretch Mark¬†Brands Research
Your time and money is valuable and we don‚Äôt want you to waste either one. So we did the research on most of the top stretch mark¬†products available.
We studied each product to determine which consistently not only had the right ingredients with clinically proven results, but also the right proportions. We disqualified the ones with unnecessary and useless ingredients.
But we didn‚Äôt stop there. After all, numbers and percentages are only part of the story. We went on to seek out real customers who had used the products we tested. We asked them for testimonials and compared them with our notes, and then compiled this information to give you a list of the best products on the market.
What our Research Uncovered
A great stretch mark treatment¬†should only contain clinically proven ingredients that treat both the epidermis and the dermis, to provide a total action repair and nourish solution for the skin.
Most brands did not pass the above criteria.
Some of the products included the right ingredients, but filled their treatments¬†with other useless synthetic ingredients. Almost all of them avoided quality control testing.
The brands we did pick, we stand by. We are confident that these products can help you achieve your goals.
Our Stretch Mark Treatment¬†Top Pick:
We are excited about our final pick and we think you‚Äôll agree. This company has a solid reputation, a high quality product, third party monitoring and testing. It also has a solid return policy and stands by its products.

#1 Top Pick
Research Verified
Stretch Mark Repair
 If you want to try a stretch mark¬†treatment, then Research Verified should be your first choice. If any stretch mark¬†treatment¬†is going to work for you, this is it.
It provides a ‚Äò2-step dual action‚Äô treatment to repair and rejuvenate the skin. Moisturizing and nourishing the skin internally and externally: treating both the dermis and epidermis.
Quality: Their stretch mark¬†product contains a repair silicone gel AND¬†nourishing cream PLUS it contains the best, clinically proven ingredients such as Allium cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract,¬†Aloe barbadensis(Aloe Vera) and the oils of¬†Emu, Safflower, Sunflower, Jojoba and Vitamin E.
Reputation: Their reputation is top notch. They have several third party monitoring services, including buySAFE, Norton, and Trustee.
Guarantee: All purchases of Research Verified¬†Stretch Mark Repair¬†are backed by a 365 day Risk Free 100% Money Back Guarantee. That is the best guarantee that we have seen from any manufacturer. This 1 year guarantee shows how confident they are in their product.
Perhaps most importantly, they‚Äôre an established company that offers excellent customer service, safe checkout and on-time delivery.
They clearly have a commitment to quality as well, and guarantee that their supplements are made in an FDA registered laboratory that is cGMP certified.
So, if you‚Äôre looking for the best stretch mark¬†product available from a reputable company with a rock solid 365 day money back guarantee, I‚Äôd say this is the product to try.
The only issue with Research Verified is that due to the demand they are often sold out. To avoid having to put yourself on a waiting list, take advantage of the benefits while they‚Äôre in stock.

#2 Pick
Sieva Skincare Stretch Mark & Scar Removal Cream

Falling just short of our number one selection is Sieva¬†Stretch Mark & Scar Removal Cream. Their product does contain some good ingredients but we felt that it was a little too watery. Their number one ingredient is ‚Äòdeionized water‚Äô and while this is essential for a good product, it shouldn‚Äôt be the main ingredient. That being said, it does contain aloe vera, tocopheryl acetate and jojoba oil¬†and the ingredients in the product were clearly stated on the label. We felt that it was definitely a well made product.
We did find the price a little on the high side. At over $60 a bottle/tub we felt it was a little too expensive,¬†especially for such a watery solution.
Our own tests showed that it was a good product, but we all know that stretch mark treatment needs to be tackled internally and externally. Unfortunately, the treatment was missing some vital ingredients such as silicone, onion bulb extract and emu oil. If they want to charge such a high price, we felt that they should thicken up the treatment and add some of the top clinically proven ingredients, therefore we¬†rate this only as our¬†#2 spot. ¬†That said, if you don‚Äôt mind taking a chance, this product might work for you.
 Take a better look at the actual product‚Ä¶














Rating: OK








#3 Pick
Protege Advanced Stretch Marks Therapy

This product is made by a company called Protege. This product contains¬†Aloe Vera Powder Extract however, this is not the same as the aloe vera gel, and is simply not as effective. The benefits of aloe vera gel are well documented in clinical studies for treating burns/scars, not the powdered extract.
Since the company itself has a good track record and most consumers I spoke to were pretty satisfied with it, I still consider this to be a solid product. Just remember that it has a few slight disadvantages.
Furthermore, it does not contain Allium cepa (Onion) Bulb Extract which we felt was the number one ingredient to help heal scars.¬†This means that you may not see results as quickly as you would do with our #1 product.
If you don‚Äôt mind waiting longer to see results, then this product could be right for you.
 Take a closer look and decide for yourself‚Ä¶

Brand Identity



The visual representation of your culture.
Brand is 100% communication. The imagery you communicate with is just as important as the words you choose.
