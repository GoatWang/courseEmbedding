Liam McCarthy Cup Trophy Replica Full Size (1:1)
The MacCarthy Perpetual Challenge Cup | All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Cup
The MacCarthy Perpetual Challenge Cup (commonly referred as the McCarthy Cup (incorrectly spelled)) is a trophy awarded annually by the GAA to the hurling team that wins the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship.
It was first presented in 1921 and replaced the Great Southern Cup as the All-Ireland trophy. Limerick, as All-Ireland champions in 1921, were the first recipients of the Liam McCarthy Cup. In 1992 the original Liam McCarthy Cup was retired. Tipperary were the last team to claim the original. In 1992 an exact replica was commissioned by the GAA, which was produced by Kilkenny goldsmith James Mary Kelly, and has been awarded on an annual basis since then. Kilkenny were the first team to win the ‘current’ McCarthy Cup. The original McCarthy Cup remains on display in the GAA museum in Croke Park, Dublin.   Sources: Wikipedia.
All-Ireland winners are permitted to keep the Liam MacCarthy Cup for a period of one year until the following year’s All-Ireland final. Kilkenny hold the record for retaining the cup on the most occasions. Kilkenny held the All-Ireland title for four consecutive years from 2006 until 2009. All-Ireland-winning captains receive a model replica of the Liam MacCarthy Cup.
