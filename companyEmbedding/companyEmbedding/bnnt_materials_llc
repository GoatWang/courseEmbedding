The initial product is considered “beta” because additional refinements in the production process are being made. The amounts of boron and hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) present in the material are being adjusted while optimizing for BNNT. Customers planning on utilizing wet chemistry to work with the material should take particular note of this, as different batches will have slightly different amounts of BNNT, h-BN and boron. All BNNT P1 (beta) products are catalyst free (elemental B and N > 99.9%)
 
Key BNNT properties include [1,2,3]:

Matches strength of Carbon Nanotubes (CNT); BNNT and CNT are the strongest two fibers that will ever be made.
Actually fibril, i.e. few wall very very long tubes (this has not yet been achieved for CNT in any quantity and may never be achieved).
Maintain strength to over 900°C; CNT start losing strength at 400°C.
Thermally very conductive.
Electrically an insulator.
White/clear. 
Functionizable. 
Possibly no cytotoxic effects [4,5].

Neutron Detectors
Neutron detectors with 96% Boron-10 (B-10) are under development.

					Safety and Environment

  Email 








BNNT (Boron Nitride Nanotubes)  are nanomaterials. All handling, processing, shipping, receiving and transportation of the material must meet all U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations as well as end user country requirements as applicable.
From discussions with the U.S. EPA, BNNT should be treated as nanomaterials in an R&D phase, i.e. no special approvals are required. Customers should employ safety processes appropriate for born nitride and similar to what would be used for carbon nanotubes.
A BNNT Material Safety Data Sheet will be provided with all orders. Customers outside of the U.S. should check with their country specific safety and environmental requirements for working with novel nanomaterials.

Thermal management – Thermally-conductive and electrically-insulating plastics (electronics)
BNNT can increase thermal conductivity of polymers >10x and climbing – BNNT powders have been incorporated into thermoplastic polymers (polyamide, polyethylene, etc.), and self-supporting BNNT sheets have been infused with epoxy              (>3 W/mK and climbing).  They show promise of manufacturable, electrically-insulating, thermally-conductive packaging and coatings for enhanced passive cooling of electronic components, high-performance batteries, and heat / flame-resistant, high-strength cabling. - M. B. Jakubinek, J. F. Niven, M. B. Johnson, B. Ashrafi, K. S. Kim, B. Simard and M. A. White, Thermal conductivity of bulk boron nitride nanotube sheets and their epoxy-impregnated composites, Physics Status Solidi A, 1–6, 2016.- T. Terao, C. Zhi, Y. Bando, M. Mitome, C. Tang, D. Golberg, Alignment of boron nitride nanotubes in polymeric composite films for thermal conductivity improvement, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 114 (10), 4340–4344, 2010.- C. Zhi, Y. Bando, T. Terao, C. Tang, H. Kuwahara, D. Golberg, Towards thermoconductive, electrically insulating polymeric composites with boron nitride nanotubes as fillers, Advanced Functional Materials, 19 (12) 1857-1862, 2009.
Higher-strength, lighter-weight, higher-temperature composite structures (aerospace, wind-turbines)
BNNTs are renowned for stiffness and strength (1.1 TPa and 61 GPa, respectively) - over 30 times stronger than bullet-stopping Kevlar.  BNNTs have higher interfacial forces to polymers than CNTs because of their local polarity.  When mixed with lightweight polymers such as thermoplastics, polyimides, and epoxies, the long tubes reinforce the material, promising lighter-weight and stronger materials.  Potential applications include aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment, transparent or translucent armor, and thin protective coatings.  Keeping their strength to over 800 °C in air, far beyond CNT or Kevlar         (400 °C), BNNTs are also projected to be an optimal filler for a new generation of lightweight ceramic composites with a wide range of high–temperature applications in systems such as jet engines or gas turbines.- P. Arenal, M-S. Wang, Z. Xu, A. Loiseau and D. Golberg, Young modulus, mechanical and electrical properties of isolated individual and bundled single-walled boron nitride nanotubes, Nanotechnology, 22(26):265704, 2011.- X. Chen, L. Zhang, C. Park, C. C. Fay, X. Wang, C. Ke, Mechanical strength of boron nitride nanotube-polymer interfaces. Applied Physics Letters, 107 (25): 253105, 2015.- P. Nautiyal, C. Rudolf, A. Loganathan, C. Zhang, B. Boesl and A. Agarwal, Directionally aligned ultra-long boron nitride nanotube induced strengthening of aluminum-based sandwich composite, Advanced Engineering Materials, 2016.
EMI shielding and multi-functional materials
Noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd, and Ag) or ferromagnetic materials can be introduced inside the hollow cores of BNNTs for applications such as electromagnetic shielding composites, where some inductance may be required while maintaining the insulating properties of BNNTs.  Moreover, metal-filled BNNTs find promising applications in hydrogen storage, plasmonic devices, and memory devices.- T. Pham, A. Fathalizadeh, B. Shevitski, S. Turner, S. Aloni, Alex Zettl, A universal wet–chemistry route to metal- filling of boron nitride nanotubes, ACS Nanoletters, 2015.- X. Hong, D. Wang, D.D.L. Chung, Boron nitride nanotube mat as a low-k dielectric material with relative dielectric constant ranging from 1.0 to 1.1, Journal of Electronic Materials, 2016.
Neutron radiation detection and shielding
BNNTs are more stable than CNTs at high temperatures and better absorb neutron radiation, both advantageous in extreme environments like outer space.  BNNT can also be used for ultra violet (UV) shielding, such as long-duration high-altitude applications and window filler material. 10BNNT (made with pure B-10) can be used as a neutron sensing element in a solid-state neutron detector with 100% suggested efficiency.- M. Ghazizadeh, J. E. Estevez, A. D. Kelkar, Boron nitride nanotubes for space radiation shielding, International Journal of Nano Studies & Technology, 4. 1-2, 2015.- P. Ahmad, M. U. Khandaker, Y. M. Amin, Synthesis of highly crystalline multilayers structures of 10BNNTs as a potential neutron sensing element, Ceramics International, 41 (3), 4544-4548, 2015.
Ultra-clean vacuum applications (cryopumps) 
BNNTs have high surface area and low service temperature – uniquely suited as cryosorbent in ultra-high & extremely-high vacuums (UHV & XHV) that limit thermal conductance and hence pumping speed of ion or turbo pumps.  This means ultra-clean (no adhesives or other hydrocarbons), deep, faster-pumping vacuum, faster regeneration, and longer lifetime.  - M. Stutzman, P. Adderley, V. Over, M. Poelker, Investigations of cryopumping for extreme high vacuum systems, 77th IUVSTA Workshop, 2016. Vibration dampingMats of BNNTs are highly viscoelastic, enable efficient vibration damping down to cryogenic temperatures (2 °K) and up to high temperatures (~800 °C), can cycle from low to high temperatures repeatedly, and maintain that viscoelasticity under loads.  Among other uses, this might passively dampen the vibrations which can severely limit performance and reliability of superconducting RF (SRF) cavities.- R. Agrawal, A. Nieto, H. Chen, A. Agarwal, Nanoscale damping characteristics of boron nitride nanotubes and carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer composites, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 5(22):12052-12057, 2013.- Xinghua Hong, Daojun Wang, D.D.L.  Chung, Strong viscous behavior discovered in nanotube mats, as observed in boron nitride nanotube mats, Composites Part B, 2016.
Piezoelectric materials for sensing and actuation
BNNT composite sheets exhibit piezoelectric and electrostrictive properties, so can generate electric charge when deformed.  This means the material could offer energy harvesting, as well as sensing and actuation capabilities when embedded in a polymer (e.g. for robotics).  Space exploration requires sensors and devices capable of stable operation in harsh environments of high thermal fluctuation, atomic oxygen, and high-energy ionizing radiation.  While conventional and state-of-the-art electrostrictive materials have limitations on use in those extreme applications, BNNT composites show promising piezoelectric and electrostrictive properties.- J. H. Kang, G. Sauti, C. Park, V. I. Yamakov, K. E. Wise, S. E. Lowther, C. C. Fay, S. A. Thibeault and R. G. Bryant, Multifunctional electroactive nanocomposites based on piezoelectric boron nitride nanotubes, ACS Nano, 2016.- A. Salehi-Khojin, N. Jalili, Buckling of boron nitride nanotube reinforced piezoelectric polymeric composites subject to combined electro-thermo-mechanical loadings, Composites Science and Technology, 68 (6), 1489-1501, 2008.
Efficient catalytic reaction
BNNTs can improve efficiency and selectivity of important catalytic reactions to produce polyolefin feedstocks.  Preliminary studies indicate boron nitride catalysts are nontoxic, do not contain precious metals, and reduce activation energy of reactions, saving energy and reagents.- J. T. Grant, C. A. Carrero, F. Goeltl, J. Venegas, P. Mueller, S. P. Burt, S. E. Specht, W. P. McDermott, A. Chieregato, I. Hermans, Selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene using boron nitride catalysts, Science, 2016.- G. Elumalai, H. Noguchi, K. Uosaki, Electrocatalytic activity of various types of h-BN for the oxygen reduction reaction, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 16, 13755-13761, 2014.
Optics and photonics applications
BNNTs are superior to CNTs in exhibiting semiconducting properties independent of chirality and diameter, with a wide band gap typically measured near 6 eV.  Potential applications include light-emitting diodes and photo detectors able to provide narrow selectivity in wavelength of emission and detection of light and fine tuning through the nanotube structure.BNNTs have been used for quantum dots, which will lead to electronic devices such as transistors, solar cells, or diode lasers.- A. Pierret, L. Schue, F. Fossard, J. Barjon, O. Ersen, S. Moldovan, F. Ducastelle, A. Loiseau, Optical and structural properties of facetted boron nitride nanotubes, European Microscopy Congress 2016: Proceedings, 476-477, 2016.- J. S. Lauret, R. Arenal, F. Ducatelle, A. Loiseau, M. Cau, B. Attal-Tretout, E. Rosencher, L. Goux-Capes, Optical transitions in single-wall boron nitride nanotubes, Physical Review Letter, 94, 037405, 2005.
Biomedical applications and 3D printing
Preliminary research indicates BNNT is not cytotoxic at concentrations of interest for biologic applications.  BNNT can be applied as nano-textured cellular scaffolding for nerve and bone tissue regeneration, nanoscale drug vectors and delivery structures, and electroporation-based oncology (cancer) therapies.  BNNTs can be incorporated in ceramic composites to improve strength and toughness.  Efficient 3D printing of ceramic composites can be applied in dentistry.- V. Raffa, C. Riggio, M. W. Smith, K. C. Jordan, W. Cao, A. Cuschieri, BNNT-mediated irreversible electroporation: Its potential on cancer cells, Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment, 2012.- G. Ciofani, V. Raffa, A. Menciassi, A. Cuschieri, Boron nitride nanotubes: An innovative tool for nanomedicine, Nanotoday, 4 (1), 8-10, 2009.
Super-hydrophobic & anti-corrosion applications
BNNT polymer composites exhibiting super-hydrophobic behavior can be applied as water-repellent textiles, self-cleaning glasses, coatings to help combat corrosion of metal substrates, and coatings to prevent icing of machines and structures.  BNNT-coated mesh could be a highly-efficient filtration membrane for separation of oil from water in oil-polluted water, benefiting the environment and human health.- L. H. Li, Y. Chen, Superhydrophobic properties of nonaligned boron nitride nanotube films, Langmuir, 26(7), 5135–5140, 2010.- Y. Yu, H. Chen, Y. Liu, V. Craig, L. H. Li, and Y.

BNNT, LLC Builds Nanotube Factory in Newport News, Virginia




(Nanowerk News) BNNT, LLC, a Newport News, Virginia start-up, began construction of the world�s first commercial factory dedicated to the manufacture of Fibril Boron Nitride Nanotubes, �Fibril BNNT�.� Boron nitride nanotubes are as strong as the better-known carbon nanotubes, but are much more heat resistant and much easier to synthesize in a high quality form.  
                     



BNNT, LLC (the Company), is proud to announce that the new factory resulted from completed negotiations and closing on a Series A Financing transaction that will provide the Company the initial investment capital it needs to make Fibril BNNT� commercially available.   
                     



With assistance from the Economic Development Authority of the City of Newport News, Virginia, the several thousand square foot factory is located near the U.S. Department of Energy�s Jefferson Lab. The foundational Fibril BNNT� synthesis technology was initially developed utilizing Jefferson Lab�s Office of Naval Research-funded Free-Electron Laser in collaboration with NASA Langley Research Center and the National Institute of Aerospace, both in neighboring Hampton, Virginia. Additional support was provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 
                     



The Company�s Fibril BNNT� is a super-strong, heat-resistant, textile-like polymer with the appearance of cotton, but a molecular backbone 100 times stronger than steel.  Fibril BNNT� is expected to attract a broad range of customers in the nanotube materials sector, a rapidly growing market now worth over $1 billion per year.  Applications of this new molecule are projected to range from Mars rocket heat shields to cancer therapies.  �The current world supply of Fibril BNNT� is under 10 grams, less than the weight of four pennies,� says the Company�s Chief Scientist Mike Smith, formerly of NASA LaRC, �but the demand for this material is tremendous.  We believe we can sell as much as we can make.  When I visit a lab or company, the final question is always�when can we have some?� 
                     



The Company projects sales of Fibril BNNT� to commercial and university laboratories around the world to begin within a year. 
                     



About BNNT, LLC




BNNT, LLC a startup company based in Newport News, VA established to manufacture Fibril BNNT� for scientific investigations, commercial product R&D and commercial products. Key staff members include the developers who invented the new processes.  More information is available at: www.BNNT.com 
                     



Synthesis technologies licensed by BNNT, LLC, were developed jointly by NASA Langley Research Center (a NASA �Center of Excellence in Structures and Materials�), the U. S. Department of Energy�s Jefferson Lab, and the National Institute of Aerospace, a non-profit formed by a consortium of major universities that serves as a strategic partner of NASA, promoting leading edge aerospace research.

DirectoryFibril BNNT™ (Boron Nitride Nanotubes) will be the basis for industry game changing revolutionary new materials and processes.
- Ultra lightweight aerospace structures: polymer and metal matrix composites with unprecedented strength, even at high temperatures
- Membranes, filters and catalyst: energy enhancements from filtering salt water to high temperature filters and thermal conductors
- Killing cancer: already lab results for significant enhancement of irreversible electroporation
- Winning sports equipment: the most advanced materials where weight, strength and endurance count
Key Fibril BNNT™ properties include:
- Matches strength of Carbon Nanotubes (CNT); BNNT and CNT are the strongest two fibers that will ever be made
- Actually fibril, i.e. few wall very very long tubes (this has net yet been achieved for CNT in any quantity and may never be achieved)
- Maintain strength to over 900°C; CNT start losing strength at 400°C
- Thermally very conductive
- Electrically an insulator
- White/clear
- Functionizable
- Possibly no cytotoxic effects
Discovery & Innovation
- Science --> the few wall novel materials with their unique chemistry will be the basis for scientific discoveries on the same scale as has taken place with CNT.
- Product R&D --> the first few tests with compositing and biomedicine indicate that Fibril BNNT™ can be used for making innovative products that will make global market impacts.
- Game changing products --> recent discoveries will result in the materials soon becoming available at prices and quantities that support long term investment for profitable products.
BNNT, LLC's goal is to provide the raw and purified Fibril BNNT™ and Fibril BxCyNz for science, product R&D and game changing products.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
