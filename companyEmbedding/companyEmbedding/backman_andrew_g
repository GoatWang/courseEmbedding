Condolences




























WILLIAMSBURG - Andrew George Bachmann, 68, inventor, entrepreneur and business leader, died on Sept. 15, at the Riverside Regional Hospital in Newport News, Va.Founder and Chairman of the Dymax Corporation, Andy's adhesive inventions and successful marketing led to the creation and development of products used in the manufacture of medical, electronic, automotive, aerospace and consumer products. His adhesives changed the way many of the items used daily are manufactured, helping companies to become "green" manufacturers, and to become more competitive in the global market place. Dymax is a global company based in Torrington, Conn., with offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and Shenzhen, P.R.C. Andy has received a number of honors for his entrepreneurial activities including being recognized as the "Executive of the Year" by the Commercial Development Association, and the University of Connecticut's Family Business Award for the outstanding Connecticut Company in 2006.

Andy pursued further research in adhesives at the Loctite Corporation in Connecticut. Andy received his M.B.A. from the University of Hartford.Having retired as CEO of Dymax in 2006, Andy moved with Clai to the Williamsburg area where the couple enjoyed their new home, as well as their condo in Litchfield, Conn.
