About Us

John Sedor & JB Earl
JB Earl and John Sedor have been providing their services as professional photographers locally – in Northeastern Pennsylvania in the Greater Wilkes-Barre and Scranton area – and nationally since 1984.
Friends since the early 80’s, they started out individually as sole proprietors during their college days. Graduates of Wilkes College (now Wilkes University),  JB earned a bachelors in Earth Sciences in 1986 and John a bachelors in accounting in 1987.
Both John and JB saw tremendous change in the industry with the advent of digital imaging. E&S, as they are commonly referred, were the first in Northeastern Pennsylvania to adopt the new technology.
“The fact that we purchased the sixth high resolution digital studio camera made in the world shows that we are committed to the business and are willing to be on the technology forefront,” said Earl. “We can still provide the traditional creative role of a photo studio while delivering to our clients a modern and technologically current product.”
“Our studio is, and always will be about meeting the customers needs. We are often given a set of near impossible parameters to follow by our clients. We manage to find that one clear path that leads to an exceptional final product,” said Sedor. “Sometimes the final product looks so good, it appears to have been an easy shoot. Those images are the ones that usually require the most time and effort — effort that truly pays off in the end.”
With clients from Hawaii to New York, John and JB are always busy and yet always available to develop new relationships.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Pernix Therapeutics’ First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference. My name is Isaac, and I will be your event specialist today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session at the end of prepared remarks, and additional instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes.
On the call today are John Sedor, Chairman and CEO; Graham Miao, President and Chief Financial Officer; George Jones, Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Angus Smith, Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning of Pernix Therapeutics.
Please be advised that Pernix issued a press release this afternoon containing financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The release, including the financial tables and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial results is available on the Company’s website at www.pernixtx.com.
During today’s call, the Company may be making forward-looking statements and actual results may differ from current expectations. Please note that under Safe Harbor rules, Pernix has no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. The Company recommends that you refer to the cautionary statements contained in the SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
I would now like to turn the call over to John Sedor. Please go ahead, sir.
John Sedor
Thank you, Isaac. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to review Pernix's continued progress with you. From a comparison standpoint due to the seasonality of our business from quarter four to quarter one, a sequential comparison is not a true indicator of our business and how it performed during the quarter. Therefore I'm going to focus my remarks on a year-over-year comparison of our business.
With that, let's take a look at our performance in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the trajectory of our business. Prescription volumes of Treximet and Silenor were in line with our expectations for the quarter, while volumes of Zohydro ER did not meet our expectations, largely due to the impact of the 20 milligram back order, which we will discuss later on the call.
Total prescriptions for Treximet was down less than 1% in the first quarter of 2017, as compared to the corresponding period of 2016. This is an indication indicative of the reversal of the five year downward trend the product has seen through mid 2016.
Additionally, we achieved year-over-year growth of 2% and 3$ in prescription volumes for Silenor and Zohydro ER with BeadTek respectively. Importantly, driven by the restructuring of our sales force which we executed in July of last year, we saw a 22% decrease in SG&A expenses year-over-year.
 Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017 improved to a loss of $300,000 in the first quarter of 2017. That's compared to a loss of $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. I earlier mentioned the back order of the 20 milligram Zohydro ER.
Let me now provide you with an update on the availability of this trend. As we announced earlier this month due to manufacturing issues with our supplier, we now expect it to 20 milligram strength will be on back order until at least the first quarter of 2018.

Since that time Pernix has and will continue to market and distribute other trends of Zohydro ER with BeadTek, including the 10 milligram, 15 milligram, 30 milligram, 40 milligram and 50 milligrams strength. Pernix continues to work directly with the wholesalers and prescribers to minimize any distraction - disruption caused by the stock. And with our supplier to ensure that Zohydro 20 milligram strength shrimp to the market place to return it to the marketplace as soon as possible.
For our utilization of the 10 milligram, 15 milligram and 30 milligrams strength of Zohydro ER with BeadTek are expected to increase in order to fulfil the patient’s need. The company anticipates that the temporary stock-up will impact the overall Zohydro ER with BeadTek prescriptions volume and growth. Pernix is currently evaluating the scope of the impact and will provide further updates as appropriate.
Now with that, let me turn the call over to George Jones, our Vice President of Sales and Marketing to discuss our commercial progress.
George Jones
Thank you, John. The first quarter is typically soft for most of the pharmaceutical industry due to changes in patients insurance, deductible resets and a higher overall out of pocket costs for patients relative to the fourth quarter.
In addition, we continue to operate in a challenging manage market environment for branded products. Understanding that, our business remains headed in the right direction. We remain focused on the highest volume prescribers we believe have the greatest potential for growth. Our prescription performance for Treximet and Silenor during the first quarter was largely in line with our expectations and we continue to be pleased with our results.
As John stated, two, three of our core brands, Zohydro ER and Silenor achieved year-over-year growth in quarterly total prescriptions and Treximet although down slightly outperformed some of our key branded competitors.
Reviewing the first quarter of 2017 performances each of our each of our core brands in greater detail, Treximet prescriptions decreased by less than 1% year-on-year. In an opioid market place that continues to be challenging and the same sort of back order of the 20 milligram strength of Zohydro ER, the total prescriptions for Zohydro ER with BeadTek grew 3% year-over-year in the first quarter 2017. I believe that products continues to be well positioned in the opioid market with the 5 strengths of Zohydro ER we have available because they offer prescribers a wide range of dosing options and flexibility.
Four of these five strengths fall below the morphine milligram equivalents that are suggested by the CDC guidelines for opiod prescribing in chronic pain that were published in March of 2016.
In regards to Silenor prescriptions, we delivered year-over-year growth of 2% versus first quarter of 2016. We are looking to really reaccelerate the growth in Silenor moving forward with the initiatives that we've recently begun to execute, including the addition of 1500 high potential sleep prescribers to our pain team target list who will receive first position calls, as well as increased incentive compensation waiting for our pain sales force. We are confident that the increased focus on qualified sleep prescribers will lead to increased growth for Silenor.
Taking a closer look at our prescription trends, the field force optimization previously implemented and use to have a positive impact on our business. You'll recall that in the third quarter and first - fourth quarters in 2016 we saw an increase in the call frequency towards top prescribers, as well as in the average cost per day.
This continued in the first quarter of 2017 and the impact of our efforts has been translated into higher prescribing and market share for our products overall and more specifically within our targets.

For Treximet, first quarter market share was 5.4% within our target. This is up 10% versus Q1 2016. Total prescriptions in our targets increased by 14% in Q1 2017 over Q1 2016. For Zohydro and BeadTek, first quarter market share was approximately 1% which was up 10% over Q1 2016. As mentioned earlier in the call, the opioid market continues to be under pressure declining 10.3% within our targets in Q1 2017 versus same period in 2016. Finally, Silenor market share was 1.46%, up 25% versus Q1 2016.
We were also pleased to report continued strong uptake of the Pernix prescriptions direct program, our prescription fulfilment program. PPD continues to gain traction as more patients utilize the program with prescriptions for Treximet and Silenor increasing by more than a 192% compared to the first quarter 20160.
The continued rapid growth of PPD during the first quarter contributed to the improving prescriptions trends across our portfolio and allowed us to mitigate some of the typical Q1 impact for our brands. We expect this trend to continue a 2017 move forward.
As evidence of this, as I mentioned earlier, PPD as a percentage of total prescriptions has reached 27% in recent weeks for Treximet, which compares to the 25% we reported on our fourth quarter call. The filed pilots for PPD for Zohydro ER has been completed and due to the positive results we are currently in a process of a full scale rollout.
Finally, as we execute our commercial plan, we completed our speaker training programs for all three brands in Q1 and have begun to ramp up our investment in peer education through Q1 and into Q2 2017. We are very pleased with the progress our commercial team has continued to achieve to begin 2017. I look forward to continuing the positive momentum throughout the year.
I will now turn the call over to our Presidents and CFO, Graham Miao for his review of the financials. Graham?
Graham Miao
Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone. I will now discuss our overall financial results for the first quarter of 2017. The sales performance of our core brands and operating results. I will then address our balance sheet and liquidity in further detail.
During the first quarter of 2017 net revenues for the company were $29.7, a decrease of 8.6% year-on-year from $32.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the lower net price for all of our core brands and the lower shipped volume for Treximet and the Zohydro ER.
Now let me look at - let's look at the specifics for each major product. For Treximet net revenues decreased by $2.5 million or 15% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Gross to net for the first quarter were 37%, down from 43% percent in the prior year period.
The decrease in gross to net year-over-year is due primarily to higher managed care rebates in the payer mix, as well as an increase in co-pay coupon deductions. For the four year 2017 we expect gross to net for Treximet to improve to the low 40s.
For Silenor first quarter 2017 net sales were down slightly, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Gross to net for the first quarter were 27%, down from 33% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross to net was due primarily to the higher managed care rebates.
For full year 2017, we expect gross to net for Silenor to be in the low to mid 30s, an improvement from 30% in 2016. For Zohydro ER net sales decreased by $0.3 million or 5% during the first quarter of 2017, compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Gross to net for the first quarter were 58%, down from 66% in the prior year. The decreasing gross to net was due to reductions across a variety of categories. For full year 2017, we expect gross to net for Zohydro ER to be in the low 60s.
Gross margin for the company in the first quarter of 2017 was a 66%, up from 65% in the first quarter of 2016, due primarily to product mix and a discontinuation of certain low margin products.

SG&A expense decreased by $5.7 million or 22% during the three months ended March 31 2017, compared to the three months ended March 31 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower selling and marketing expenses, as a result of the initiative we implemented to restructure our sales force in operations last July. We expect full year SG&A expense for 2017 to be lower than 2016, as a result of the annualized benefit of these restructuring initiatives.
R&D expense for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.5 million, compared to $0.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease was related to the lower spend for Treximet. First quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.3 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Now let me turn to our financial condition. As John stated, we continue to work to improve our financial flexibility and strengthen our balance sheet. We recently amended our credit facility with Wells Fargo and we intend to transition to another financing source on or before July 31st, 2017.
Additional details of the amended agreement are available in our 8-K filed on April 20th 2017. We have engaged in discussions with parties that have expressed interest in refinancing the revolving credit facility.
As of March 31 2017, the company had a total cash balance of $23 million. Total principal amount of debt outstanding at March 31 2017 was approximately $321 million and net debt was $298 million. The total principal amount of debt consisted of approximately $177 million of 12% senior secured notes, $130 million of 4.25% convertible notes and a $14 million under our revolving credit facility.
As discussed on previous calls, we continue to analyze various alternatives in order to proactively address our liquidity and a capital structure in a constructive manner, including strategic and the refinancing alternatives, asset sales and mergers and acquisitions.
I will now turn the call back to John Sedor. John?
John Sedor
Thank you, Graham. Let me conclude. The changes that we implement in July 2016 have led to stable or improving prescription trends for our three core brands, as well as a reduced cost structure. In the face of having to navigate through a seasonally change - challenging quarter, our performance in the first quarter indicates to us that our commercial team is really beginning to hit its stride operating within the new structure.
I am pleased with the progress we've achieved with prescriptions and truly believe that our business is making great progress. We also remain focused on further improvements to our capital structure. We will keep you updated on our progress through 2017.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Isaac to open up the line for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Patrick Dolezal with LifeSci Capital.
Patrick Dolezal
I just have a couple of questions here. So what do you attribute the growth of PPD to and also why doesn’t Silenor have the same percentage of prescriptions going through PPD as Treximet does?
George Jones
I'll take that call or that question, this is George Jones, Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Good question Patrick and for us the growth of PPD, we believe can be attributed to the fact that really we've put together a world class program and the feedback that we've been getting from the prescribers that use the program has largely been positive. And their experience when they send the patients prescriptions to our PPD program positive leading to increased penetration, increased use of the program.
Regarding Silenor, with Treximet it's a largely a commercially insured patient base. Silenor for sleep medicines the mix is more towards Medicare Part D. And we know that you cannot send government insured patients into a program like PPD, you're going to get less penetration of the program for a product like Silenor than you will for a product like Treximet.

Patrick Dolezal
Great. Thank you.
George Jones
Thank you. 
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And it appears there's no further questions over the phone at this time.
John Sedor
Okay. Thank you Isaac. And that concludes our first quarter call.
Operator

Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Pernix Therapeutics’ Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference. My name is Lori, and I will be your event specialist today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And we will conduct a question-and-answer session at the end of prepared remarks, additional instructions will be provided at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes.
And with us on the call today are John Sedor, Chairman and CEO; Graham Miao, President and Chief Financial Officer; George Jones, Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Angus Smith, Vice President, Business Development and Strategic Planning of Pernix Therapeutics.
Please be advised that Pernix issued a press release this afternoon containing financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The release, including financial tables and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial results is available on the Company’s website at www.pernixtx.com. The Company also expects to file its quarterly Form 10-Q with the SEC later today.
During today’s call, the Company may be making forward-looking statements and actual results may differ from current expectations. Please note that under Safe Harbor rules, Pernix has no obligation to update the information contained in these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. The Company recommends that you refer to the cautionary statements contained in the SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.
And now it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Sedor. Please go ahead, sir.
John Sedor
Thank you, Lorie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to have the opportunity to review Pernix's continued progress with you. I am going to focus the majority of my remarks on the sequential improvement of our business since the beginning of 2016 especially since we restructured our sales force in July. Since that time our story has been one of commercial execution. Quite simply, we've achieved more with less. Our efforts have produced improvement in both top and bottom line. In the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenue increased 9% over the third quarter. Importantly, during the fourth quarter total prescription volumes increased year-over-year for all three core brands, Treximet, Zohydro ER with BeadTek and Silenor. In addition, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 improved by 49% to approximately $12.5 million as compared to $8.4 million in the third quarter of 2016, and a loss of $1.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. These numbers exclude the impact of the GSK arbitration award which we will discuss later in this call. 
We are pleased with the performance of each our core brands. Of note the fourth quarter, Treximet prescriptions increased by 4% sequentially as compared to the third quarter of 2016 and 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, Silenor and Zohydro ER prescriptions increased 4% and 11% year-over-year versus quarter four 2015 respectively. For full year 2016, Treximet prescriptions declined 1% compared to 2015, a significant improvement from the decline we saw in prior years. Silenor and Zohydro ER prescriptions increased 10% and 12% over 2015. 
Moving on we remained focused on identifying potential actions that we might implement in order to improve our financial flexibility and strengthened our balance sheet. While we are unable to reach an agreement with creditors, that was in the best interest of our stakeholders in 2016. We continue to evaluate various alternatives that might proactively address our liquidity and capital structure in a constructive manner, including strategic and refinancing alternatives. Asset sales and mergers and acquisitions. 

Importantly, we've already executed on certain initiatives including regaining compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements and the appointment of Dr. Graham Miao, Dr. Dennis Langar and Gabriel Leung to the company's Board of Directors in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are pleased to have recently received a favorable opinion in our litigation with Actavis Laboratories regarding proposed generic versions of Zohydro ER. The court ruled that Actavis proposed generic version of Zohydro ER infringed two patents that cover Zohydro ER. This ruling follows a trial that took place in October of 2016. The judge in the case entered an order enjoining Actavis from engaging in the commercial manufacturing, use, offer to sell, or sale in the United States of Actavis' and their product prior to the expiration of the two patents. We believe that this decision confirms the strength and longevity of Zohydro ER patent portfolio. While Actavis recently submitted a notice of appeal of the decision, we remain confident that the District Court decision will be affirmed.
In addition, we've continued to assess opportunities to improve the abuse-deterrent properties of Zohydro ER such as licensing of innovative technologies and reformulation. Before I turn the call over to George Jones for a commercial update, I'd like to review the company's arbitration with GSK. As a reminder Pernix and GSK have been in arbitration regarding claims date related to the Treximet asset purchase and supply agreement. On January 31, 2017, the arbitration tribunal issued opinions in favor of GSK, awarding it damages and fees in the amount of approximately $35 million, plus interest. The Tribunal also denied Pernix’s claim that GSK breached its obligations under the supply agreement. Pernix has already paid GSK $16.5 million which will offset the total award. 
On March 17, 2017, we are able to negotiate a final settlement of this matter with GSK by entering into an amendment Interim Settlement Agreement between Pernix and GSK. The amendment establishes a payment schedule for satisfaction of the balance of the award granted to GSK in the arbitration. Pernix and GSK have agreed that the outstanding balance of the award is $21.45 million and that Pernix will pay the award in quarterly installment in amounts totaling $1 million in 2017, $3.5 million in 2018 and $16.95 million in 2019. Graham will review the financial impact in greater detail later in this call. 
With that let me now turn the call over to George Jones, our Vice President of Sales and Marketing to discuss our commercial progress. 
George Jones
Thank you, John. As a result of our field force reorganization in mid 2016, we now have one fully integrated sales management team and a national sales force with representatives focusing on either Zohydro ER with BeadTek or Treximet as their primary products. Every representative also promotes Silenor as a secondary product. Our sales representatives remain focused on the highest volume prescribers who have the greatest potential for growth. For the second consecutive quarters, we've experienced positive commercial result with their recently optimized, more focused sales model. 
As John stated, similar to the third quarter, the fourth quarter also saw year-over-year growth in quarterly total prescriptions for each of Treximet, Zohydro ER with BeadTek and Silenor. Reviewing the fourth quarter performance of each our core products in greater detail. Treximet prescriptions increased by 4% sequentially, compared to the third quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, total Treximet prescriptions increased by 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This is the second consecutive quarter that we've seen year-over-year growth for four quarter. This is consistent with the improving trend we've seen over the past seven quarters and a significant improvement from the 25% year-over-year declines when we purchased the product in 2014.

Longer term, we continue to proactively plan for the emergence of generic versions of Treximet in the marketplace in 2018. We expect to launch our own authorized generic in February 2018. As previously stated, we expect to retain significant market share through continued sales of the brand as well as the introduction of our authorized generic. It is worth noting that our PPD program is now responsible for approximately 25% of Treximet prescription. So we anticipate that this will be a key platform for us to transition patient to our authorized generic. In a challenging opioid marketplace, total prescription of Zohydro ER with BeadTek grew 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the third quarter of 2016. And total prescriptions were up a solid 11% year-over-year. We continue to focus on a core messages that we believe differentiate Zohydro ER in the product pay market. Those are true 12 hour pain control with no evidence of that end-of-dose failure, simple one-to-one conversion from IR Hydrocodone as well as no adjustments in start dose for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
As a result of the sales force realignment, Silenor prescriptions in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased slightly sequentially from the third quarter of 2016. However, we delivered year-over-year growth of 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. We are rolling out a number of initiatives to support the reacceleration of Silenor growth including the addition of high potential prescribers to our target list and increased incentive compensation leading for our pain sales force. 
We are confident that this increased focus on qualified sleep prescribers will lead to increase growth for Silenor.
Finally, we've recently secured a more favorable rebate agreement with an important managed care plan that improves growth finance for Silenor going forward. 
Looking ahead, we believe Silenor is a good candidate for an OTC conversion. We've already received increased from multiple large cap global pharmaceuticals companies interested in discussing this possibility with us as we continue to focus on lifecycle management and to maximize the long term prospects of this brand. Taking a closer look at our prescription trends, the field force optimization previously implemented continues to have a positive impact on our business. You'll recall that in the third quarter we saw an increase in the call frequency towards to our top prescribers as well as in the average cost per day. This continued in the fourth quarter and the impact of our efforts has translated into higher prescribing and market share for our product overall and more specifically within our targets.
For Treximet, we ended 2016 with market share of 5.7% within our targets. This is up 24% versus January of 2016. Zohydro ER with BeadTek, we ended the year with 1.04% market share which was up 21% over January 2016. And Silenor was at 1.5% which was up 24% versus January 2016. The number of healthcare professionals prescribing our brands at least once a week was up for all three of our brands in Q4 of 2016 versus Q3 of 2016. This continues the trends that we reported on our last earnings call. We believe this demonstrates that our increased call frequency is having a positive impact on healthcare professionals and their comfort level prescribing our product more in their day-to-day clinical practice. 
We are also pleased to report continued strong uptick of Pernix Prescriptions Direct, our prescription fulfillment program. PPD is gaining increased traction as more patients and providers utilize this program. With prescriptions for Treximet and Silenor increasing by more than 30% compared to the third quarter of 2016. The continued rapid growth of PPD during the fourth quarter contributed to improving prescription trends across our portfolio. And we expect this trend to continue in 2017. As evidence of this as I mentioned earlier, PPD as a percentage of our total prescription has reached 25% for Treximet in recent weeks. This compares to the 19% that we reported in the third quarter. 

We've also begun working on a pilot of PPD for Zohydro ER with BeadTek. The early results of this pilot have been positive we are currently working on a larger scale national rollout. Finally, as we discussed on our last call to enhance our sales efforts, we've wrapped our marketing program to support our three key brands. We continue to meaningfully invest in speaker programs during the fourth quarter and started 2017 off strong as well. In addition, we significantly ramp up our targeted direct-to-patient efforts and have recently launched our non-personal sampling program for Treximet to ensure that those healthcare professionals that no longer receive business from our sales representative can still pain starter samples so they can provide to their patients when they are prescribing Treximet. 
So we are very pleased with the progress our commercial team has made in 2016 and look forward to continuing the positive momentum throughout 2017. 
I'll now turn the call over to our President and CFO, Graham Miao for a review of the financials. Graham? 
Graham Miao
Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone. As reported in earnings press release this afternoon, we are pleased with the progress that Pernix team has continued to achieve in execution our turnaround of strategy. Our vision is to grow our current brands, pursue other growth opportunities and maximize long-term stakeholder value. In addition, as John said, we have taken actions to cure our NASDAQ listing deficiencies, have now regained compliance.
Now, let me discuss our overall financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016, the sales performance of our core brands and operating results. And I will then review our full year 2016 results and address our balance sheet and liquidity in more detail. As a reminder, in reviewing sales I'll discuss gross to net and important measure of net sales performance in a pharmaceutical business. For the sake of clarification, if I mention a gross to net of 60% that means we realized net sales of $0.60 for every dollar of gross sales after discounts, rebate and returns. Importantly, as a result of the GSK arbitration award and settlement, when discussing our operating results I'll be using non-GAAP measures including adjusted net revenues. As stated in our press release, we made certain accruals in our fourth quarter 2016 financial statements to reflect the impact of the GSK arbitration award. The GSK arbitration award also affected several line items on our income statement including COGS and G&A expense and interest expense. These accruals relate to sales of Treximet that occurred in 2015 and 2014. Therefore, we believe non-GAAP measure more accurately reflect in the line business performance. We use adjusted net revenues to reflect the reclassification of certain gross to net adjustments in our 2016 GAAP net revenues to 2015 and 2014, specifically GAAP net revenues for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by $15.3 million of disputed Treximet rebate claim. These claims were recorded in 2016 for sales that occurred in 2015 and 2014 specifically $12.5 million and $2.8 million for 2015 and 2014 respectively. 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, adjusted net revenues for the company were $45.4 million, an increase of 9% from $41.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 4% from $43.8 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential increase in adjusted net revenues was driven by several factors including favorable gross to net for our generic portfolio, stronger demand for our three core brands and a wholesaler inventory restocking, partially offset by a lower gross demand. 
The year-over-year increase during the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to favorable gross to net for our generic portfolio increased volume for our three core brands, partially offset by a decrease in net price.

Now let's look at specifics for each major product. For Treximet, adjusted net revenues were stable during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and a fourth quarter of 2015. Full year 2016 gross to net for Treximet on an adjusted basis were 45%. For Silenor, fourth quarter 2016 net sales were down slightly as compared to the third quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter 2015. Full year 2016 gross to net for Silenor were 30%. For Zohydro ER, net sales increased sequentially by $1.1 million or 18% during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2016. Year-over-year Zohydro net sales was stable. While total prescription volume grew 11% year-over-year, net sales growth was negatively impacted by wholesaler inventory changes. Full year 2016 gross to net for Zohydro ER were 66%. Gross margin for the company on an adjusted basis in fourth quarter of 2016 was 75%, up from 74% in the third quarter of 2016 due primarily to an increase in sales, and up from 68% in fourth quarter a year ago primarily due to product mix.
SG&A expense adjusted for legal fees relates with GSK arbitration remained flat at $24.2 million this quarter, the same as in the prior year period. R&D expense for fourth quarter of 2016 was a $0.9 million compared to $2.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease was related to lower spend for Treximet and Silenor. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $12.5 million, an increase of 49% from $8.4 million in the third quarter and a 60% from $7.8 million in the prior year period. 
Let me now briefly review our full year 2016 operating results. Full year 2016, adjusted net revenues were $156.1 million as compared to full year 2015 adjusted net revenues of $163.4 million, a decrease of 4%. This decrease was primarily driven by a $7.1 million decrease in adjusted net Treximet sales. $4.1 million decrease in other product revenues and $4 million decrease in Silenor net sales, partially offset by $8.2 million increase in Zohydro net sales. Full year 2016 adjusted net revenues for Treximet were $82.2 million as compared to $89.3 million in 2015, a decrease of 8%. The decrease was driven primarily by changes in wholesaler inventory, as well as a decrease in prescription volume, partially offset by favorable net pricing. 
Full year 2016 sales of Silenor were $16.9 million as compared to $20.9 million for 2015, a decrease of 19%. The change in Silenor in net revenues was driven by changes in wholesaler inventory and a reduction in net price, offset by a 10% increase in prescription volume.
Full year 2016 sales of Zohydro ER were $24.7 million as compared to $16.5 million for 2015, an increase of 50% including a 12% increase in prescription volume. As a reminder, Pernix acquired Zohydro ER in April 2015 with the first sale of the product in May 2015. On a comparable over eight months basis Zohydro ER net revenues increased by 9%. Adjusted gross margin for full year 2016 increased to 71% from 70% in 2015. Adjusted SG&A expenses excluding the impact of the GSK arbitration award was $97.8 million for the full year 2016 as compared to $97.4 million in 2015. The increase was driven by legal expenses and was partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses. R&D expense for the full year 2016 was $6.1 million as compared to $8.2 million in 2015. This decrease was due primarily to lower spend for Treximet and Zohydro. Full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $15 million as compared to $20 million in 2015. 
Now let me turn to our financial condition. As John stated, we are working to improve our financial flexibility and strengthened our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016 the company had a total liquidity of approximately $53 million. In 2016, to strengthen our balance sheet, we raised the capital under our controlled equity program for net proceeds of $19.7 million. Our settlement with GSK which allows us to pay the award over three years with only $1 million due in 2017 will have a significant positive impact on our liquidity in a near term. 

Total principal amount of debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 was approximately $334 million and net debt was $298 million. The total principal amount of debt consisted of approximately $190 million of 12% Senior Secured Notes, $130 million of 4.25% convertible notes and $14 million under our revolving credit facility. On February 1, 2017, we made a semi-annual principal and interest payment of approximately $24.2 million on our 12% Senior Secured Notes per the terms of the indenture.
As discussed earlier, we continue to analyze various alternatives in order to proactively address our liquidity and capital structure in a constructive manner including strategic and refinancing alternatives, asset sales, and mergers and acquisitions. 
I'll now turn the call back to John Sedor. John?
John Sedor
Thank you, Graham. To summarize, the changes we've implemented over the last eight months in sales and marketing execution and improvement in our cost structure continue to have a positive impact on our adjusted net revenues and adjusted EBITDA. We remained focused on continuing to improve our commercial execution and drive growth of our key brand. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to improve our operating cash flow and address our balance sheet. We are committed to creating long-term stakeholder value and look forward to a successful 2017. 
With that I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions]
And we'll go first to Patrick Dolezal at LifeSci Capital. 
Patrick Dolezal
Hi. Just one quick question here. I was just wondering if you guys may be able to talk a little bit about some of the broader implications of the PPD program. 
George Jones
Yes. This is George Jones, I'll be glad to address that question. The PPD, in today's pharmaceutical market getting branded medication has been become even more challenging for prescribers. Our PPD program makes it easier for them to access -- ensure access of the branded product at the pharmacy as well as alleviates a lot of the burden that the office has to may have to undertake to get a branded product. So that has allowed our target prescriptions to more freely prescribe Treximet and Silenor and enhance their prescribing overall and grew their prescribing overall. 
Operator 
And gentlemen it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the program back over to you for any additional or concluding remarks. 
John Sedor
Thank you, Lori. I think again I just want to commit to our stakeholders that we are focused on driving this company forward. And look forward to talking to you at the end of next quarter. Thank you. 
Operator 
And ladies and gentlemen, once again that does conclude today's program. And again I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today.
