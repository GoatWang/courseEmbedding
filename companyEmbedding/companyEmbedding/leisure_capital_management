Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank.

We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Objectives for the Fund Component of a Portfolio 




The LCM Mutual Fund portfolio is designed to provide investment exposure to diverse asset classes.  Equity fund portfolios are invested in a basket of no-load funds in the mid-cap, small-cap, and international arenas.  Our core investment philosophy encompasses a mix of growth and value investment styles to ensure balanced returns through market cycles.


 


 


Objectives for the Fixed Income Component of a Portfolio


The LCM Fixed Income portfolio is customized to each client’s needs.  Our team is experienced in both investment grade taxable and tax-free fixed income securities.   The team actively manages the duration of the portfolio holdings to control risk, and to ensure the appropriate income or total return is being generated for each client’s portfolios.  Depending on the clients’ objectives, we will invest a portion of the fixed income allocation into diversified mutual funds to gain exposure to less liquid areas such as high yield bonds.  A variety of options are available for clients desiring fixed incomes. For those seeking tax-free income, we manage California tax free bonds, in addition to federal tax free bonds from all states. We also offer short term cash investment portfolios for those who need to access their cash within the next 2 years. 


 


 


Objectives for the Equity Component of a Portfolio 


The LCM Core Equity Portfolio seeks to maximize long-term capital appreciation.  The portfolio invests in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of U.S. companies.  LCM selects investments from companies in the mid & large cap arena.   Highly speculative or illiquid stocks are not candidates for purchase.  Risk control is an important element in the construction of the portfolio. To control risk, extreme overweighting or underweighting of the portfolio relative to the S&P 500 is normally avoided.  To diversify, the portfolio consists of 30-40 equally weighted positions, each making up a small portion of the portfolio.  In addition, we utilize risk management software to understand the relative risk of our holdings to the market.  Risk is also controlled through disciplined purchases at reasonable valuations, and seeking out companies with projected above average dividend or cash flow generation which we see as protecting valuation.


 


 


Our Equity Buy Discipline 


LCM employs a core investment philosophy in the management of the portfolio.  The core approach provides an opportunity to invest in quality companies with superior earnings growth whose equities are selling at attractive valuations.  Most companies under consideration have a special competitive advantage in their business, are focused on shareholder value, manage their business for long-term growth (not for quarterly reporting), employ a discipline in capital spending, have a business model focused on recurring revenue streams, and demonstrate the ability to generate significant cash flow.   We establish a buy and sell target on our holdings based on either projected discounted cash flow valuations or multiples of earnings.  This is a similar method employed by mergers & acquisition firms who buy businesses based on projected cash flow and projected returns on invested capital.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
