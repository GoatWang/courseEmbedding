Printing and Packaging





The global economic impact of counterfeit products has reached an estimated $1.7 trillion dollars. No industry is immune to the issue: electronics, books, cosmetics or pharmaceutical drugs are being counterfeited. 
The dangers of this phenomenon have serious consequences and the costs are soaring.
Applied DNA Sciences can help.














Applied DNA Sciences’ patented SigNature DNA molecular tags can be added to ink or varnish that is used to create labels, primary and secondary packaging, allowing manufacturers and brands to validate and authenticate throughout the entire supply chain, all the way to the retail shelf.
SigNature DNA is compatible with a wide variety of host carriers, such as varnishes, inks, textiles and metals. The flexibility of this technology is unprecedented. Once inoculated with SigNature DNA, a product can be tested any time thereafter to authenticate the item’s originality.
Our anti-counterfeiting solutions cannot be copied and provide definitive, forensic proof of authentication. Applied DNA Sciences is able to furnish a Certificate of DNA Analysis (CoDA), effectively deterring counterfeiters and strengthening the supply chain.

First CertainT Recycled PET Towels to Arrive on U.S. Retail Shelves 
      by Fourth Quarter of 2017



Applied 
      DNA Sciences, Inc. (“Applied DNA,” “the Company,” NASDAQ: APDN), has 
      signed a new multi-year, exclusive license agreement with Loftex 
      Home, LLC, a well respected manufacturer of high-quality towels and 
      home textiles. Under a prior agreement announced in March 2017, Applied 
      DNA provides CertainT™ 
      platform services to Loftex to verify the authenticity and origin of 
      recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET post-consumer) used in bath 
      and beach towels. The first products using recycled PET verified with 
      the CertainT platform are expected at retail by the fourth quarter of 
      2017. The new multi-year agreement between the two companies is now 
      exclusive for bath and beach towels in the United States, non-exclusive 
      for plush throws and bath rugs, and provides for long term guaranteed 
      minimum annual revenues as well as trademark licensing royalties to 
      Applied DNA.
    

      “Retailers, brands and consumers want to know where their products come 
      from and where they are going,” said Charles Gaenslen, CEO of Loftex 
      Home. “Sustainability product claims are central to our recycled PET 
      programs and CertainT verifies our claims throughout the supply chain. 
      Our initial agreement with Applied DNA evolved to be a long-term 
      exclusive collaboration addressing the need for transparency in supply 
      chains. The response from retailers based on our initial launch of our 
      Fusion Fibers with CertainT collection announced in March exceeded our 
      expectations, which is why we are expanding our use of recycled PET 
      verified by the CertainT platform.”
    

      CertainT provides a single platform to tag, test, track and trace 
      products throughout a certified supply chain. Applied DNA’s molecular 
      tag is extruded into the recycled components that create recycled PET 
      fiber with no impact to performance or quality of the blended staple or 
      filament PET yarns. Thereafter, any piece of the CertainT-tagged towels 
      may be authenticated by detecting the molecular tag present in the 
      recycled PET fiber, thus ensuring the recycled nature and origin of the 
      fiber. Loftex will use recycled PET verified by CertainT to create 
      recycled PET and cotton blended towels. The benefits of a blended 
      recycled PET and cotton towels include less drying time and less water 
      usage during washing, making for a more sustainable and time-saving end 
      product.
    

      “This new exclusive collaboration enables Loftex to provide an added 
      level of trust to its customers,” said Dr. James Hayward, president and 
      CEO of Applied DNA. “The ability to differentiate its brand in a 
      competitive marketplace reinforces Loftex’ leadership as a transparent 
      and responsible brand. As a licensee, Loftex also highlights the growing 
      awareness and adoption of our CertainT program, which integrates our 
      commercial platforms into a licensable strategy, with a public-facing 
      trademark that stands for authenticity and performance.”

      fashion, quality, sustainability and value as a supplier of bath towels, 
      beach towels and plush throws. Founded in 1980, this privately held firm 
      started as a beach towel factory and has steadily expanded in the 
      international marketplace; Loftex is now one of the largest terry towel

Applied DNA Signs GHCL As CertainT Licensee Using Recycled PET And PET For Bedding

July 17, 2017 



STONY BROOK, N.Y. — July 11, 2017 — Applied DNA Sciences Inc. has signed a multi-year license agreement with GHCL Lt.d, a global manufacturer of home textiles, to provide CertainT™ platform services in connection with source-verified, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and recycled PET (post consumer) in select home textile products. PET is the clear plastic best known for its use in water bottles, and is the most widely recycled plastic in the world. GHCL will use Applied DNA’s CertainT platform in connection with PET and/or recycled PET blended bed sheets, pillowcases, and shams products sold in-store or online in the United States. GHCL has also licensed Applied DNA’s CertainT trademark for use on its products, as well as for promotional, marketing and sales materials. The agreement provides for guaranteed minimum annual revenues as well as trademark licensing royalties to Applied DNA.
GHCL will use Applied DNA’s CertainT platform, a fully integrated supply chain platform for verifying PET and recycled PET authenticity from source to retail shelf. With this platform, GHCL assures that any of its textile products using PET and recycled PET will contain the original source raw materials. Applied DNA will provide its patented and proprietary tagging, testing and tracking services to GHCL as a CertainT licensee.
“As the need for sustainable and recyclable textiles continues to increase in demand from our customers, we want to offer products that provide true traceability that go beyond a paper document,” stated Neeraj Jalan, Business Head, Home Textiles, GHCL. “In these uncertain times, our customers deserve and expect certainty. The collaboration with Applied DNA provides a means to produce and supply our customers with source-verified, recycled products, as well as access to new authentication technologies in synthetic fibers that Applied DNA develops over the course of our relationship.”
As part of the platform, Applied DNA’s molecular tag is extruded into recycled components that create recycled PET fiber, with no impact to performance or quality of the fiber or filament yarns. Thereafter, any piece of CertainT-tagged textiles can be forensically authenticated by detecting the molecular tag in the recycled PET fiber, ensuring its authenticity and origin.




“We bring ‘CertainT’ in uncertain times especially as many brands and retailers need to fulfil their sustainability goals by the year 2020,” said Dr. James Hayward, president and CEO, Applied DNA. “The CertainT platform will help GHCL produce innovative products utilizing an efficient and trusted traceability system with a fair return. Differentiating their brand in the marketplace through use of our CertainT trademark will signify to consumers the products comply with our supply chain platform and are verifiably made from recycled fibers.”

("Applied DNA," "The Company") (APDN), a provider of DNA-based supply chain, anti-counterfeiting and anti-theft technology, product genotyping and product authentication solutions, released results from a recently commissioned survey of over 2,000 Americans regarding their attitudes toward misleadingly-labeled Aloe vera products and the importance of products with forensically verified ingredients.Key findings include:86 percent of Americans said they would be more likely to buy an Aloe vera product that has ingredients that have been forensically verified over a product that did not. 76 percent of Americans said they would not be likely to buy an Aloe vera product they were planning to buy if they heard or read that it did not, in reality, contain any Aloe vera.68 percent of Americans would be willing to pay more for an Aloe vera product made with forensically verified ingredients versus one that is not.65 percent of Americans indicated willingness to pay more for an Aloe vera product that is ethically sourced versus one that is not.The survey was conducted online by Harris Poll on behalf of Applied DNA Sciences in response to recent revelations that many consumer products claiming to contain Aloe vera do not, in reality, contain measurable amounts of this ingredient (Bloomberg Aloe vera Article).Dr. James Hayward, President and CEO of Applied DNA, said, "No consumer wants to be cheated. With independent laboratory studies revealing scant evidence of Aloe vera within a range of consumer products prominently featuring this ingredient on their labels, there is clearly a need for better verification techniques. Our verification methods in Aloe or food supplements are a natural extension of our work in cotton, and offer an ideal way to help manufacturers protect their brands and supply chain while benefitting consumers and retailers alike."Scientists can identify ingredients -- including Aloe vera -- using unique gene sequences known as the "bar code of life" (BCOL), but these sequences are subject to degradation during harsh processing and can be easily lost or damaged when a product is manufactured.In comparison, Applied DNA Sciences' SigNature® molecular tagging is much more stable. The tags are combined with the Aloe vera during the manufacturing process. The tags meet the FDA guidance for Physical Chemical Identifiers that can be added to foods or drugs and can be ingested by consumers. Preliminary studies conducted by the company suggest that, in contrast to BCOL sequences, SigNature molecular tags survive in finished goods and can be detected even after dilution from their original concentration by one million-fold, proof that Aloe vera is contained in the product. To review findings, click here.Quality control laboratories can now use the SigNature platform to prove the presence of key ingredients such as Aloe vera. Unlike the BCOL, SigNature molecular tags are not restricted to biological materials and can also be used to tag non-biological materials. By using SigNature tags and forensic knowledge, brands and retailers can protect their reputations and attract the high percentage of consumers indicated by the survey results who value and would be prepared to pay more for products with forensically-verified ingredients.Applied DNA's solutions have helped consumer product companies, textile manufacturers as well as military and government agencies to authenticate products and protect their brands.Survey MethodologyThis survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Applied DNA Sciences from February 7-9, 2017 among 2,171 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables, please contact: john.shearman@adnas.com.About Applied DNA SciencesWe make life real and safe by providing botanical-DNA based security and authentication solutions and services that can help protect products, brands, entire supply chains, and intellectual property of companies, governments and consumers from theft, counterfeiting, fraud and diversion.

			Cotton Supply Chain Protection

Responsible supply chains begin at the source






Backed by the power of forensic science, botanically-derived SigNature® T DNA tags can be applied at the gin, allowing for cotton to be tracked and authenticated throughout the entire supply chain, from the raw fiber stage all the way to the retail shelf. SigNature T tagging provides assurance of quality and provenance, and helps brands guarantee label claims with certainty.
For Pima fiber (genetically known as G. barbadense), we also conduct “fiberTyping” of the fibers to confirm they are truly Pima based on our patented DNA test.
Responsible sourcing eliminates issues facing the textile industry, such as conflict cotton and fiber substitution. Certainty is only a molecule away™.

HomeGrown Cotton: Tagged, Tested, Trusted from Source to Shelf
Consumers want to know where their cotton products come from, and if they are made responsibly.  Brands often make product claims, such as "Grown in the USA", sustainable and ethically-sourced, or 100% Egyptian or Peruvian, how can we really know if these claims are being met?
Molecular tagging and DNA testing means that when something says it is made with 100% American grown cotton, or products made in a specific country, it is. The SigNature T System helps to provide certainty in supply chains.




fiberTyping® Process
To ensure your product is 100% pure, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. provides fiberTyping®: a DNA test used to verify ELS Pima content. In textile supply chains, substitution takes place when Pima is replaced or blended with upland. Watch was we explain the process in order to avoid counterfeiting. To learn more visit www.adnas.com.




PimaCott™: Pure by Nature. Proven By science
Through a groundbreaking DNA tracking system, we are able to verify PimaCott as the world's only Pima cotton from crop to consumer. By using fiberTyping®, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc., ensures that all cotton is in fact extra long stable Pima. Then, after marking it with SigNature®T, we are able to verify that our Pima stays pure across the supply chain.




SigNature® T Introduction Video
Applied DNA Sciences, Inc., introduces SigNature®T: DNA solutions for textiles and apparel used to combat counterfeiting. SigNature®T is based on unique DNA signatures that are custom made to survive manufacturing processes and be authenticated throughout. Watch as we demonstrate and explain how it is the most secure solution to preserve quality, integrity, and authenticity of products. To learn more visit www.adnas.com.




PimaCott™: Proven Pima Purity From our Farms to Your Family.
Cannon Michael, Sixth-Generation Farmer at Bowies Farm, explains that although all Pima cotton starts out pure, only PimaCott is guaranteed to stay that way through a revolutionary DNA tracking system provided by Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. This tracking system verifies that our Pima is never blended or contaminated.




fiberTyping® Introduction Video
In order to verify fiber content by looking at the DNA code inherent to the specific type of cotton, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc., introduces fiberTyping®. Watch as we explain the process to help maintain a high quality standard that helps build customer loyalty for the brand and retailer.





What is SigNature T?


SigNature T is a custom, botanically-based DNA molecule that bonds tenaciously to fibers at the source. Our fully-automated DNA Mixing and Distribution system ensures that fibers are tagged thoroughly. After tagging and compacting, bales are barcoded so that when a sample of fiber is submitted for authentication, it can be traced back to a particular bale number, providing absolute proof of provenance.
SigNature T DNA tags are designed to be compatible and stable in a wide range of textile substrates and manufacturing processes. This secure and cost-effective solution can help assure quality and provide forensic-level authentication in fiber, yarn, fabric and finished products.






Molecular tagging and authentication helps customersbuildtrust and credibility
protectreputation and intellectual property
assistquality control and assurance efforts
complywith applicable laws
promotelegal enforceability of transactions
minimize lossesby reducing illegal activity
monitorand verify supply chain








SigNature T DNA provides the forensic power behind PimaCott™, the world’s first supply-chain-verified Pima cotton, as well as Homegrown™ source-verified upland cotton. Both of these brands are revolutionizing cotton purity. Over 100 million pounds of cotton has been marked. Home textile products made with PimaCott are now available in U.S. retail stores.






To achieve pima cotton certainty, SigNature T DNA tagging is complemented with fiberTyping®?What is fiberTyping®?


fiberTyping is a patented DNA test that can be used to determine if a product contains the presence of Gossypium barbadense DNA (Extra Long Staple), Gossypium hirsutum DNA (Upland), or a blend of both.
fiberTyping is a powerful tool to help the cotton industry ensure that products labeled as 100% ELS, or 100% Pima, are compliant with label claims.








fiberTyping is only available for SigNature T customers 



fiberTyping with Quantification


fiberTyping with quantification provides information about the percentage of Extra Long Staple (ELS) DNA and Upland DNA present in a “blended” sample. This service is available only when a result is determined to be a blend. Quantification is only available for greige fabrics. For more information about this service, please contact us at textilesales@adnas.com.

Adding DNA markers to fabrics, threads and finished goods, and the analysis of inherent fiber DNA, can help restore order to the global textile community.   Applied DNA has been actively developing forensic DNA marking solutions that protect all electronic components - semiconductors, microchips, printed circuit boards (PCBs), resistors, capacitors, and routers. These solutions provide the muscle for supply chain security.   DNA taggants are the most advanced and secure technology available to the printing and packaging industries to combat counterfeit products. APDN's SigNature® DNA taggants offer a high level of security and flexibility in a cost-effective and easy-to-use format to suit the requirements and budget of any company   SigNature DNA is proving itself to be the Gold Standard crime fighting technology for the CViT industry. Easy detection and absolute authentication make our DNA ideal for marking offenders, evidence, merchandise or cash in a wide variety of law enforcement operations.
