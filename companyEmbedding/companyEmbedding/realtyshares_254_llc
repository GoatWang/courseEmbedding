RealtySharesSign Up for RealtySharesBack to PlatformsSimilar Real Estate Crowdfunding PlatformsAcquireRealCrowdCityFundersRealtyShares ReviewAverage Rating:  2 reviewsSummaryRealtyShares has some strong points including adequate capital, support from savvy backers, a user-friendly website and some good press. Investors also like its low minimums ($1,000 for your first deal, generally $5,000 thereafter) and hold periods as short as six months. It is also trying some innovative things such as accepting Bitcoin and providing market-specific products aimed at its core investor base among IT professionals in five cities.
But the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips, a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators. The site does have some funds and multi-family/commercial projects, but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the RE crowdfunding universe.
Investors who like the deals it offers will find RealtyShares a likeable and easy to navigate platform. But it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved.
BACKGROUND
Founded in Q2 2013 by CEO Nav Athwal, RealtyShares has received $11.9 million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including $10 million in a Series A funding in April 2015. Its backers include well known venture capitalists Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst Partners and 500 Startups.
Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director John Jarve, who sits on the board of hot automated investing service Betterment, is on the RealtyShares board.
RealtyShares has been compared to a Lending Club for real estate, offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects. It funds about 10 to 20 projects a month.
The inspiration for Athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development. Those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on RealtyShares. After the financial crisis of 2007, traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access.

PROS

Low minimum of $1,000 for first investment (otherwise usually $5,000), focus on deals with short lifecycles



CONS

Deal quality is not high, weighted to single family home flip market, only for accredited investors, high fees



BOTTOM LINE
RealtyShares is a smaller player in the real-estate crowdfunding arena. It has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments. But its deal flow includes many single family home flips, which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms. Its fees are considered higher than average too.
PHILOSOPHY
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal says that RealtyShares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served, especially small real estate developers and house flippers. The process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the 2007 economic crisis. They often will not lend to individuals without W2 income.
Crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns. In one case covered by CNBC, Chicago house flipper Ben Walhood said he can get full funding from RealtyShares in as little as an hour. Investors in his deals would earn around 11% vs loans around 4% if backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in traditional financing.
RealtyShares is “able to provide quicker, more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards. Banks just aren’t meeting that need,” Athwal said.
TYPICAL PROJECTS AND GEOGRAPHY
At the time of our test, there were five live deals on the site including a fund, two single family flips and two apartment buildings. Three were in California and the others in New York and Florida. RealtyShares has done transactions in 18 states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from Florida, California, Illinois and Texas.
The deals we saw ranged in size from $160,000 to $1.6 million for the RealtyShares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions. Minimum investment ranged from $2,000 to $25,000 and hold terms from eight months to five years.
RealtyShares says it welcomes cash-flowing/value add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes; equity investment in fix and flips in high demand/low supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.
TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
RealtyShares is only open to accredited investors, meaning those with net worth of $1 million or income of $200,000 a year. The platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the $2 million to $30 million range and all types of cash-flowing residential and commercial projects.
RealtyShares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years.
Many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model. RealtyShares said in 2014 that 10 to 15% of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate.
INTEREST IN INNOVATION
Athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities. Unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms, the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities. It is creating market-specific products to enable developers in Seattle, Dallas, Austin, Miami and Chicago to raise funding from local investors.
RealtyShares’ interest in innovation led it in 2014 to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment. The platform says this is a more cost-effective and streamlined way for investors to send money, especially if they are abroad, because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers.
WEBSITE POPULARITY
As of June 2015, RealtyShares has an estimated 90,000 monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about 4 minute on the site with 4.04 page views.  About 92% of the traffic is from the United States. As of mid-May 2015, RealtyShares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the United States.
LEADERSHIP TEAM
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer. He worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing California and national developers and REITs in the San Francisco Bay area. He doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid.
The management team is rounded out by eight specialists with hands-on experience in operations, transactions, engineering and other disciplines. Again, they have strong resumes but not high name recognition. RealtyShares’ leadership earned a B grade in one review.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?
RealtyShares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as 500 Startups, so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform. But it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites, and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin.
Blogger Mark Robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on RealtyShares. While he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays, he said they have met or beat expectations.
SUMMARY
RealtyShares looks like a solid platform with long-term potential. While its low minimum investments are attractive, it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees. It is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals, especially fix and flip single family home projects. It’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors.
DEAL STRUCTURE
Investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or second-position loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of 8-12% annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period and/or a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property.
HOW DOES REALTYSHARES SCREEN INVESTMENTS?
RealtyShares reviews the sponsors first, looking for companies with experience. It says it runs background and credit checks. Then it reviews proposed transactions including financials, geography, property type and quality, and investment structure.
“While each investment includes risk and RealtyShares cannot guarantee results, our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform,” it says. “Once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform, investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity, and if so, how much.”
So, like other crowdfunded real estate sites, it’s up to you to do your due diligence.
UNDERWRITING/DEAL FLOW
CEO Athwal said that as of spring 2015 RealtyShares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about 1 in 10 properties that are offered to it.  “I think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property,” he said.
However, the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips. These are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators, and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lower-quality deals than bigger budget projects.
FEES
RealtyShares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications. But the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement. The ones we viewed were 40-plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher.
As best we could tell, the ongoing fees to RealtyShares as manager of the transaction LLC amounted to 1% a year. RealtyShares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals.
This article says RealtyShares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of 2 percent to 3 percent. It also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment (including providing investors with tax documents and distributions) through the platform. A RealtyShares presentation for a funding round in February 2014 showed it earning fees of 3-5%.
That is comparatively high among RE crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment.
EASE OF USE
RealtyShares has a more involved sign-up process than other platforms we have test driven. While some sites initially ask only for an email address and password, RealtyShares seeks your phone number, address, employer, amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you.
If you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment, that might make you leery. But it also suggests RealtyShares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests, so it could be a plus for some. It offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with 11-14% return, 6-9 month hold, unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals.
After signing up, you see a countdown clock on the 30-day cooling off period. You are also directed to a helpful eight-minute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it. We liked this feature a lot.
LISTINGS
The page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow. There’s a deal dashboard, and tabs allow you to view an overview, financials, documents, photos, background on management and FAQs. One closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project, which provided a wealth of information.
WHAT AM I BUYING ON REALTYSHARES?
RealtyShares explains what you are actually buying this way: RealtyShares sets up a separate Limited Liability Company (LLC), for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform.  That LLC in turn will make a loan on a real estate property (in the case of a debt investment) or hold equity in an LLC or LP that in turn owns real estate property (in the case of an equity investment).  When you invest through RealtyShares, you own shares in that LLC.  Using this structure, you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level.
If you invest in a debt deal, the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments.  A share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.  If you invest in an equity investment opportunity (usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties), the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents and/or a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold. As with debt investments, a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.
HOW SAFE IS MY MONEY?
As we’ve said before, real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices, and that holds even truer for RealtyShares. Experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals. Real estate by its nature can be a risky investment, and RealtyShares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals.
While offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum, RealtyShares could do a much better job of making its site transparent. It says it is currently affiliated with WealthForge, a registered broker-dealer with FINRA and member of SIPC (both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors), and that WealthForge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyShares.
But it’s unclear if SIPC protections apply to RealtyShares investments. Even if they do, they do not protect against loss in value, liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors. They would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer.
In truth, it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter, and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate.

There are various pluses and minuses with the service, but RealtyShares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors. Crowdfunding generally democratizes investing, making it available to even the smallest investors. The accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals. We’ll give RealtyShares a rating of 4.0 out of 5.0 stars, with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative.


Crowdfunding Website Reviews

We have singled out RealtyShares for the purpose of our first Real Estate Crowdfunding Site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye. Not the least of which is their forward-thinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using BitCoin. We love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments. This move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing, the Tech Crowd.

Terms of Service
Last Updated June 27, 2016
Introduction
Thank you for visiting the RealtyShares website, owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. ("RealtyShares" or the "Company"). Please read these Terms of Service (this "Agreement" or the "Terms") carefully before using the services offered by RealtyShares. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at www.realtyshares.com, all other sites owned and operated by RealtyShares that redirect to www.realtyshares.com, and all subdomains (collectively, the “Site”), and the service owned and operated by the Company (together with the Site, the “Service”). By accessing, browsing or using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content, information, or other materials or services to the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, RealtyShares' Privacy Policy, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published by RealtyShares from time to time on the Site (collectively, the “Published Information”), each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by RealtyShares from time to time without notice to you. In order to access the Site and the Service, you must accept these Terms, the Privacy Policy and any Published Information.

Your use of the Site and Service is governed by the then current version of the Agreement in effect on the date of such use. RealtyShares may, at its sole discretion, modify and replace the Agreement at any time and without prior notice to you by posting the updated Agreement on the Site. By using and accessing the Service, you acknowledge and agree to review the then current version of the Agreement prior to each such use. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to the Terms have been published on the Service or otherwise provided to you constitutes your acknowledgement of, and binding agreement to, the then current Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and RealtyShares will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time the events giving rise to such dispute occurred. RealtyShares further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason. You agree that RealtyShares and its subsidiaries and affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.

Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements between you and RealtyShares, including any customer, account or marketing agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available on the Site. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with RealtyShares, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for the Service or otherwise. If you do not agree to all the terms of this Agreement, RealtyShares’ Privacy Policy and/or any Published Information, you are not eligible to participate in RealtyShares’ Service or otherwise use this Site. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including investment managers ("Managers"), investors, including Accredited Investors, as defined by SEC Regulation D Rule 501 (collectively, "Investors"), and visitors to the Site, who in any way use the Site or Service provided by RealtyShares (in each case, a "User"). Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer rights on Users or third parties.

Authorized User
The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old (and at least the legal age in your jurisdiction). You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old and of legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. RealtyShares may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity. The Service is not available to any Users suspended or removed from the Site or Service by RealtyShares. By using the Service, you represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site or Service.

Some of our services, and certain web pages of the Site, are available only to those Users who have been authorized by us to access those services and web pages. Only Users of the Service who are Accredited Investors as defined in Regulation D Rule 501 adopted pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (“Accredited Investors”) with a valid User ID and password are authorized to access such services and web pages. In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. The authorization for such Accredited Investors may require completion of an Accredited Investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening and/or identification verification. By registering for, accessing, browsing, and/or otherwise using the services and/or web pages for which access is restricted to Accredited Investors, you represent and agree that you are an Accredited Investor. Should you cease to be an Accredited Investor at any time, you agree to immediately notify RealtyShares and to refrain from accessing such restricted portions of the Site and/or Service. Further, because access to the restricted portions of the Site is limited by applicable law to Accredited Investors, you agree that you will not allow anyone to access such restricted portions of the Site, or share or disclose any information obtained through restricted portions of the Site with anyone, regardless of whether you believe such person or entity to also be an Accredited Investor.

As part of RealtyShares’ authorization process, each user shall be required to provide, among other things, a valid email address. In providing your email address and agreeing to these Terms of Service, each authorized user consents to receiving email notifications from RealtyShares concerning offerings. In some cases, users of the restricted portions of the Site may be required to confirm their status as an Accredited Investor. In order for RealtyShares to confirm that your representation regarding your status as an Accredited Investor is accurate when made and continues to be accurate from time to time, you agree to provide RealtyShares with all information and documentation reasonably required by RealtyShares to verify your status as an Accredited Investor, including (without limitation) delivering a completed Accredited Investor questionnaire, tax returns, brokerage statements, bank statements, resumes and other private financial information. Should you fail to provide any requested information and documentation that confirms your status as an Accredited Investor, RealtyShares may immediately suspend, block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site or Service. RealtyShares may change its eligibility criteria at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice.

Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where RealtyShares or North Capital is not authorized to provide such information or services.

Securities Offerings; No Professional Advice Provided
The Service and securities offerings on this Site are available only to Accredited Investors who understand economic and investment risk and are willing to bear the consequences of that risk. Additionally, the securities offerings on this Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private real estate investments. By using the Site or Service, you represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. You acknowledge and agree that you have significant experience investing in investments of the type offered through the Site, including, without limitation, real estate, equities, notes and other securities, you understand that all of the investments offered through the Service are inherently very risky, and you understand the risks associated with the investments offered through the Site, and you are comfortable with the risk of losing your entire investment invested through the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that investing in private placements carries with it low liquidity concerns and long-term commitments and that the securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded. Additionally, Investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements. For those reasons, these offerings may be made availabile only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. If you are using the Site on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on such entity’s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify RealtyShares for violations of this Agreement.
You further represent and agree that you understand that RealtyShares does not guarantee the performance of any offerings made through the Site or Service and any and all projections, estimates, and expectations for investments offered through the Site or Service are merely opinions and should not be relied on for any purpose whatsoever. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Site do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. You acknowledge and agree that RealtyShares is not a registered Investment Company or Investment Advisor within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, respectively. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Website.
RealtyShares is not a registered broker-dealer, funding portal, or investment advisor and does not conduct any activity that would require such registration. Equity securities are offered through North Capital Private Securities Corporation(“North Capital”), member FINRA/SIPC. Individual personnel of RealtyShares may become registered representatives of North Capital. North Capital has developed a business continuity plan on how they will respond to events that significantly disrupt business. North Capital is located at 2825 E. Cottonwood Pkwy, Suite 500, Salt Lake City, UT 84121, tel: (888) 841-9984.

Such summaries are intended for informational purposes only and do not purport to be complete, and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed discussions contained in the investor document package relating to such investment opportunity. The information contained in the Website has been prepared by RealtyShares without reference to any particular user's investment requirements or financial situation, and potential investors are encouraged to consult with professional tax, legal and financial advisors before making any investment.


You may not become a beneficial owner of 20% or more of any issuer's outstanding voting equity securities (an “Issuer Covered Person”) without becoming subject to certain “bad actor” disqualifying events described in Rule 506(d) (a “Disqualifying Event”). You represent that you are not subject to a Disqualifying Event and that you will promptly notify RealtyShares in writing should any Disqualifying Events be applicable to you. RealtyShares is not liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) disclosures, nor for determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.

The information contained in the Site has been prepared without reference to any particular User's investment requirements or financial situation.

Some products and services described on the Site may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all clients.

You acknowledge that you are not relying on RealtyShares or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, partners, agents or employees in making an investment decision. Always consider seeking the advice of a qualified professional before making decisions regarding your business and/or investments. RealtyShares does not endorse any investments and shall not be responsible in any way for any transactions you enter into with other Users.

Copyright Policy
RealtyShares does not permit infringement of intellectual property rights on the Site or Service, and RealtyShares will remove copyright infringing activities or related User Content if RealtyShares is properly notified that such User Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that any material on the Site violates this Agreement or your intellectual property rights, please notify RealtyShares as soon as possible by sending an email to contact@realtyshares.com, or by contacting RealtyShares’ Agent (listed below), with the following information pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) (please confirm these requirements with your legal counsel, or see the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3), for more information): (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, sufficient for RealtyShares to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Pursuant to Section 512(c)(2) of the DMCA, RealtyShares’ designates the following agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement:

		Nav Athwal
		525 Market Street, Suite 2800
		San Francisco, CA 94105
nav@realtyshares.com

For the avoidance of doubt, only DMCA notices should go to RealtyShares’ Designated Copyright Agent. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. We reserve the right to remove User Content alleged to be infringing or otherwise illegal without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, RealtyShares will also terminate a User's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.

Your correspondence or interaction with other Users is solely between you and such other Users.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.
