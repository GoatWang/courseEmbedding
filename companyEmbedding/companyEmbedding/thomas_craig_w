Click on the pictures below to learn more the pests and rodents that are found throughout the Hudson Valley region.MiceRatsDear Mr. Thomas, I have been meaning to write to say how happy I am with your pest control service for quite a while. Our problems with rats, mice and moths are totally gone. Your technicians do a first class job, they are: professional, diligent and friendly. A class act all around. This week you sent a team of Cary, Brendan W. and Sean M. to install roof insulation, and I can’t say enough good things: they did a fantastic job from start to finish, When Cary noticed that there was a insufficient roof ventilation, he quoted me an estimate to install roof vents, went to Lowes and bought them, jumped up on the roof and had them installed by the time his colleagues had finished pumping the insulation. I am hugely impressed with your company and your people. You deserve every success, and I will have no hesitation, whatsoever in recommending you to friends.BatsSquirrelsNative animals in North America, comprising several genera of which Sciurus seems to be the most important with respect to their structural nuisance potential.

Fruit trees also may suffer damage from their feeding, and they also consume nuts, insects, mushrooms, and bird eggs. Food is carried in cheek pouches and stores are placed in the burrow for consumption later, including during the winter when the animal awakens from its hibernation on regular intervals to feed and then return to sleep. Burrows are normally underground, but some species also create nests in trees, which they use part of the day. Adults are capable of living for up to 8 years, but in nature a maximum of 3 to 4 years is normal. Mating is in mid spring, and a single litter per year is normal, with 4 to 8 young per litter.Insects and SpidersAntsSummer.
