Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

*Performance from 7/1/1987 through 12/31/2014, net of fees. Growth and performance reflect the highest advisory fee charged to any client during this period. It includes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. From 1987 through 1995, returns are based on actual trade signals and the performance of the Kemper High Yield Bond Fund. Beginning in 1996, the Lipper High Yield Bond Index was used as a benchmark, since actual trade signals were applied to multiple funds. All investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss. Past performance does not ensure future investment success.
