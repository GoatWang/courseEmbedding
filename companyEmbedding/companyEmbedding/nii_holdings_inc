NII Holdings Receives Non-Compliance Notice From Nasdaq
Jun 20 17
On June 14, 2017, NII Holdings, Inc. (Company) received a notice (Notice) from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) indicating that the bid price of the Company's common stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until December 11, 2017, to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price rule, the closing bid price of the Company's common stock must be at least $1.00 or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-day compliance period. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by December 11, 2017, the Company may be eligible to seek an extension of the compliance period if it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other listing standards, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and provides written notice to Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency. If the Company fails to regain compliance prior to the expiration of the compliance period including any extension, Nasdaq will provide written notice to the Company that its securities are subject to delisting. The Notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company's common stock, which will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Company intends to actively monitor the closing bid price for its common stock and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).

International Direct Connect℠
International Direct Connect℠ simplifies coordination of a multinational workforce, improves the decision making process, and eliminates the need
            for long distance calling, calling cards, operators, busy signals, “phone tag”, voice mail messages and “on hold” time - just get right through.
            Use Direct Connect service with the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and El Salvador when traveling to any of these countries. PTT roaming
            coverage for 3G devices is continuing to expand to new destinations. Check with your local market for availability.

History[edit]
NII originally launched as the international business unit of Nextel Communications[7] as McCaw International in 1995. Later Nextel changes its name to Nextel international in 1997.[8]
Nextel International changed its name to NII Holdings in 2001[9]
Divestiture of Minority Interest[edit]
In China, NII Holdings had to sell its minority interest in Shanghai CCT-McCaw Telecommunications Systems Co., Ltd in March 2000 because China Unicom Informed NII Holdings that its minority share of twelve percent had to be terminated because its financing structure was no longer permitted by Chinese regulations.[10]
Due to unfavorable market conditions, NII Holdings sold their twenty one percent Minority interest[11] of NEXNET Co(Nextel Japan) to Motorola for 10 million in exchange for forgiveness of debt owed to Motorola in 2001[12]
NII Holdings also sold their fourteen percent minority interest in Telus[11] for 196 million dollars also in the year 2001[12]
First Bankruptcy and Reorganization[edit]
NII Holdings filed its first chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 2002. The road to bankruptcy started when NII Holdings' Nextel Argentina operating company failed to make a principle payment of 108 million in December 2001. In February 2002, NII Holdings failed to make a 41 million dollar interest payment on a 650 million dollar bond as well in order to preserve cash while it restructured its debts and implemented a revised business plan.[13]
NII Holdings exited from bankruptcy in On November 12, 2002 with Nextel owning 36% of the restructured company.[13]
Following its Bankruptcy restructuring, NII Holdings begins trading a NII on NASDAQ as NIHD.[8] in 2003
Discontinuation and Divestiture of Nextel Philippines[edit]
Nextel Philippines started operations in 1995. But due to poor operating performance, being in violation of Philippine ownership laws, as well as an attempt to save cash, NII Holdings decided to stop funding its Nextel Communications Philippines, Inc operations at the end of fiscal year 2001.[14] By the end of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2002, NII Holdings sold its 59.1% share in Nextel Philippines with its fifty three thousand, eight hundred subscribers for 23.5 Million[15] to the The Velarde group called Next Mobile[16]
Quarterly report Amendments[edit]
On October 27, 2004, NII amended its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2004 to restate its financial statements to correct the errors in the periods in which they originated as soon as practical.[17]
On March 7, 2005, the company said it would restate financial statements for the entirety of 2003 and the first nine months of 2004 after finding accounting errors.[18]
Agreement with Televisa[edit]
In February 2010, NII Holdings and Grupo Televisa signed a definitive agreement under which Televisa would have acquired an equity stake in Nextel Mexico. Under the agreement, Televisa would have invested $1.44 billion in cash for an initial 30% equity stake in Nextel Mexico, which implies Nextel Mexico's pre-investment value at $4.3 billion.[19] On October 19, 2010, however, vice president and COO in Mexico Gustavo Cantu announced the partnership had been terminated by mutual agreement. More recently Cantu spoke about the future of content and telecommunications in Mexico.[20]
Divestiture of Nextel Peru and Chile[edit]
In August 2013, NII Holdings completed the sale of Nextel Peru to Entel.[21] for 400 million dollars[22]
In August 2014, NII Holdings sold Nextel Chile to Fucata, S.A[21]
Second Bankruptcy and Reorganization[edit]
On January 26, 2015, it was announced that AT&T had entered into an agreement with NII Holdings, Inc. to acquire its wireless business in Mexico for US$1.875 billion, less the outstanding net debt of the business at closing, in a transaction pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Decline and Mismanagement[edit]
The road to bankruptcy is one that was due to the arrogance of NII Holdings' Mexican executives. Nextel Mexico President Peter Foyo started a trend for other executives to live in other states where Nextel had no corporate presence. Nextel's president lived in Cancun, Quintana Roo.[23] In December 2013, Peter Foyo was ousted from the company [24]
Nextel Mexico also reacted too slow to Sprint's announcement of that it was shutting down its iDEN network in 2012.[23] Sprints iDEN shutdown eliminated Nextel's Mexico main competitive advantage, which was free calls to the United States. After Sprint Shutdown its iDEN network, many regions of Northern Mexico lost coverage that was provided by Sprint via roaming agreements. This resulted in a loss of one million subscribers the following Quarter; leaving Nextel Mexico with only 2.93 million subscribers.[25] After Nextel Mexico coverage degraded due to Sprint's iDEN Shutdown, Nextel Mexico also delayed the deployment of the 30Mhz of Spectrum that it acquired in the 1.7 and 2.1 GHz bands in 2010 resulting in additional subscriber losses in Mexico.[25]
NII named John McMahon president and Gustavo Cantu remained as COO after Peter Foyo was dismissed. Gustavo Cantu left the company the next year to join New York Life as it's COO for Mexico.
Defaulting on Bonds[edit]
Due to falling subscriber count in Mexico and mounting debt of US$5.8 billion, NII Holdings opted to not pay $118.8 million in interest obligations on Senior Notes that were due on August 15, 2014.[26] On September 15, 2014 NII filed for bankruptcy protection[27] after losing 77 thousand subscribers and $629 million in the previous quarter.
Divestiture of Mexican Assets[edit]
On April 30, 2015, NII Holdings finalized the sale of Nextel Mexico, of which it held control for 18 years, for US$1.875 billion. NII Holdings ended up with US$1.448 billion in Net Proceeds after paying off a defaulted debt balance of $350.5 million to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest due under its debtor-in-possession loan that it borrowed in March 2015.[28]
Post Bankruptcy[edit]
NII Holdings exited bankruptcy with court approval on June 29, 2015. [29] where it offered 100 million shares of new common stock and $745 million in cash to its debt holders under its old stock ticker NIHD. In September of the same year, NII Holdings announced that they sold forty-nine percent of Nextel Argentina to Grupo Clarin further reducing their operations in the Argentinian Market in order to support their growing Brazilian operations.[30]
Sale of Nextel Argentina[edit]
On January 29, 2016 NII Holdings completed selling its remaining shares of Nextel Argentina to Clarín Group.[31]

History[edit]
NII originally launched as the international business unit of Nextel Communications[7] as McCaw International in 1995. Later Nextel changes its name to Nextel international in 1997.[8]
Nextel International changed its name to NII Holdings in 2001[9]
Divestiture of Minority Interest[edit]
In China, NII Holdings had to sell its minority interest in Shanghai CCT-McCaw Telecommunications Systems Co., Ltd in March 2000 because China Unicom Informed NII Holdings that its minority share of twelve percent had to be terminated because its financing structure was no longer permitted by Chinese regulations.[10]
Due to unfavorable market conditions, NII Holdings sold their twenty one percent Minority interest[11] of NEXNET Co(Nextel Japan) to Motorola for 10 million in exchange for forgiveness of debt owed to Motorola in 2001[12]
NII Holdings also sold their fourteen percent minority interest in Telus[11] for 196 million dollars also in the year 2001[12]
First Bankruptcy and Reorganization[edit]
NII Holdings filed its first chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 2002. The road to bankruptcy started when NII Holdings' Nextel Argentina operating company failed to make a principle payment of 108 million in December 2001. In February 2002, NII Holdings failed to make a 41 million dollar interest payment on a 650 million dollar bond as well in order to preserve cash while it restructured its debts and implemented a revised business plan.[13]
NII Holdings exited from bankruptcy in On November 12, 2002 with Nextel owning 36% of the restructured company.[13]
Following its Bankruptcy restructuring, NII Holdings begins trading a NII on NASDAQ as NIHD.[8] in 2003
Discontinuation and Divestiture of Nextel Philippines[edit]
Nextel Philippines started operations in 1995. But due to poor operating performance, being in violation of Philippine ownership laws, as well as an attempt to save cash, NII Holdings decided to stop funding its Nextel Communications Philippines, Inc operations at the end of fiscal year 2001.[14] By the end of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2002, NII Holdings sold its 59.1% share in Nextel Philippines with its fifty three thousand, eight hundred subscribers for 23.5 Million[15] to the The Velarde group called Next Mobile[16]
Quarterly report Amendments[edit]
On October 27, 2004, NII amended its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2004 to restate its financial statements to correct the errors in the periods in which they originated as soon as practical.[17]
On March 7, 2005, the company said it would restate financial statements for the entirety of 2003 and the first nine months of 2004 after finding accounting errors.[18]
Agreement with Televisa[edit]
In February 2010, NII Holdings and Grupo Televisa signed a definitive agreement under which Televisa would have acquired an equity stake in Nextel Mexico. Under the agreement, Televisa would have invested $1.44 billion in cash for an initial 30% equity stake in Nextel Mexico, which implies Nextel Mexico's pre-investment value at $4.3 billion.[19] On October 19, 2010, however, vice president and COO in Mexico Gustavo Cantu announced the partnership had been terminated by mutual agreement. More recently Cantu spoke about the future of content and telecommunications in Mexico.[20]
Divestiture of Nextel Peru and Chile[edit]
In August 2013, NII Holdings completed the sale of Nextel Peru to Entel.[21] for 400 million dollars[22]
In August 2014, NII Holdings sold Nextel Chile to Fucata, S.A[21]
Second Bankruptcy and Reorganization[edit]
On January 26, 2015, it was announced that AT&T had entered into an agreement with NII Holdings, Inc. to acquire its wireless business in Mexico for US$1.875 billion, less the outstanding net debt of the business at closing, in a transaction pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Decline and Mismanagement[edit]
The road to bankruptcy is one that was due to the arrogance of NII Holdings' Mexican executives. Nextel Mexico President Peter Foyo started a trend for other executives to live in other states where Nextel had no corporate presence. Nextel's president lived in Cancun, Quintana Roo.[23] In December 2013, Peter Foyo was ousted from the company [24]
Nextel Mexico also reacted too slow to Sprint's announcement of that it was shutting down its iDEN network in 2012.[23] Sprints iDEN shutdown eliminated Nextel's Mexico main competitive advantage, which was free calls to the United States. After Sprint Shutdown its iDEN network, many regions of Northern Mexico lost coverage that was provided by Sprint via roaming agreements. This resulted in a loss of one million subscribers the following Quarter; leaving Nextel Mexico with only 2.93 million subscribers.[25] After Nextel Mexico coverage degraded due to Sprint's iDEN Shutdown, Nextel Mexico also delayed the deployment of the 30Mhz of Spectrum that it acquired in the 1.7 and 2.1 GHz bands in 2010 resulting in additional subscriber losses in Mexico.[25]
NII named John McMahon president and Gustavo Cantu remained as COO after Peter Foyo was dismissed. Gustavo Cantu left the company the next year to join New York Life as it's COO for Mexico.
Defaulting on Bonds[edit]
Due to falling subscriber count in Mexico and mounting debt of US$5.8 billion, NII Holdings opted to not pay $118.8 million in interest obligations on Senior Notes that were due on August 15, 2014.[26] On September 15, 2014 NII filed for bankruptcy protection[27] after losing 77 thousand subscribers and $629 million in the previous quarter.
Divestiture of Mexican Assets[edit]
On April 30, 2015, NII Holdings finalized the sale of Nextel Mexico, of which it held control for 18 years, for US$1.875 billion. NII Holdings ended up with US$1.448 billion in Net Proceeds after paying off a defaulted debt balance of $350.5 million to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest due under its debtor-in-possession loan that it borrowed in March 2015.[28]
Post Bankruptcy[edit]
NII Holdings exited bankruptcy with court approval on June 29, 2015. [29] where it offered 100 million shares of new common stock and $745 million in cash to its debt holders under its old stock ticker NIHD. In September of the same year, NII Holdings announced that they sold forty-nine percent of Nextel Argentina to Grupo Clarin further reducing their operations in the Argentinian Market in order to support their growing Brazilian operations.[30]
Sale of Nextel Argentina[edit]
On January 29, 2016 NII Holdings completed selling its remaining shares of Nextel Argentina to Clarín Group.[31]

History[edit]
NII originally launched as the international business unit of Nextel Communications[7] as McCaw International in 1995. Later Nextel changes its name to Nextel international in 1997.[8]
Nextel International changed its name to NII Holdings in 2001[9]
Divestiture of Minority Interest[edit]
In China, NII Holdings had to sell its minority interest in Shanghai CCT-McCaw Telecommunications Systems Co., Ltd in March 2000 because China Unicom Informed NII Holdings that its minority share of twelve percent had to be terminated because its financing structure was no longer permitted by Chinese regulations.[10]
Due to unfavorable market conditions, NII Holdings sold their twenty one percent Minority interest[11] of NEXNET Co(Nextel Japan) to Motorola for 10 million in exchange for forgiveness of debt owed to Motorola in 2001[12]
NII Holdings also sold their fourteen percent minority interest in Telus[11] for 196 million dollars also in the year 2001[12]
First Bankruptcy and Reorganization[edit]
NII Holdings filed its first chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 2002. The road to bankruptcy started when NII Holdings' Nextel Argentina operating company failed to make a principle payment of 108 million in December 2001. In February 2002, NII Holdings failed to make a 41 million dollar interest payment on a 650 million dollar bond as well in order to preserve cash while it restructured its debts and implemented a revised business plan.[13]
NII Holdings exited from bankruptcy in On November 12, 2002 with Nextel owning 36% of the restructured company.[13]
Following its Bankruptcy restructuring, NII Holdings begins trading a NII on NASDAQ as NIHD.[8] in 2003
Discontinuation and Divestiture of Nextel Philippines[edit]
Nextel Philippines started operations in 1995. But due to poor operating performance, being in violation of Philippine ownership laws, as well as an attempt to save cash, NII Holdings decided to stop funding its Nextel Communications Philippines, Inc operations at the end of fiscal year 2001.[14] By the end of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2002, NII Holdings sold its 59.1% share in Nextel Philippines with its fifty three thousand, eight hundred subscribers for 23.5 Million[15] to the The Velarde group called Next Mobile[16]
Quarterly report Amendments[edit]
On October 27, 2004, NII amended its 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2004 to restate its financial statements to correct the errors in the periods in which they originated as soon as practical.[17]
On March 7, 2005, the company said it would restate financial statements for the entirety of 2003 and the first nine months of 2004 after finding accounting errors.[18]
Agreement with Televisa[edit]
In February 2010, NII Holdings and Grupo Televisa signed a definitive agreement under which Televisa would have acquired an equity stake in Nextel Mexico. Under the agreement, Televisa would have invested $1.44 billion in cash for an initial 30% equity stake in Nextel Mexico, which implies Nextel Mexico's pre-investment value at $4.3 billion.[19] On October 19, 2010, however, vice president and COO in Mexico Gustavo Cantu announced the partnership had been terminated by mutual agreement. More recently Cantu spoke about the future of content and telecommunications in Mexico.[20]
Divestiture of Nextel Peru and Chile[edit]
In August 2013, NII Holdings completed the sale of Nextel Peru to Entel.[21] for 400 million dollars[22]
In August 2014, NII Holdings sold Nextel Chile to Fucata, S.A[21]
Second Bankruptcy and Reorganization[edit]
On January 26, 2015, it was announced that AT&T had entered into an agreement with NII Holdings, Inc. to acquire its wireless business in Mexico for US$1.875 billion, less the outstanding net debt of the business at closing, in a transaction pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Decline and Mismanagement[edit]
The road to bankruptcy is one that was due to the arrogance of NII Holdings' Mexican executives. Nextel Mexico President Peter Foyo started a trend for other executives to live in other states where Nextel had no corporate presence. Nextel's president lived in Cancun, Quintana Roo.[23] In December 2013, Peter Foyo was ousted from the company [24]
Nextel Mexico also reacted too slow to Sprint's announcement of that it was shutting down its iDEN network in 2012.[23] Sprints iDEN shutdown eliminated Nextel's Mexico main competitive advantage, which was free calls to the United States. After Sprint Shutdown its iDEN network, many regions of Northern Mexico lost coverage that was provided by Sprint via roaming agreements. This resulted in a loss of one million subscribers the following Quarter; leaving Nextel Mexico with only 2.93 million subscribers.[25] After Nextel Mexico coverage degraded due to Sprint's iDEN Shutdown, Nextel Mexico also delayed the deployment of the 30Mhz of Spectrum that it acquired in the 1.7 and 2.1 GHz bands in 2010 resulting in additional subscriber losses in Mexico.[25]
NII named John McMahon president and Gustavo Cantu remained as COO after Peter Foyo was dismissed. Gustavo Cantu left the company the next year to join New York Life as it's COO for Mexico.
Defaulting on Bonds[edit]
Due to falling subscriber count in Mexico and mounting debt of US$5.8 billion, NII Holdings opted to not pay $118.8 million in interest obligations on Senior Notes that were due on August 15, 2014.[26] On September 15, 2014 NII filed for bankruptcy protection[27] after losing 77 thousand subscribers and $629 million in the previous quarter.
Divestiture of Mexican Assets[edit]
On April 30, 2015, NII Holdings finalized the sale of Nextel Mexico, of which it held control for 18 years, for US$1.875 billion. NII Holdings ended up with US$1.448 billion in Net Proceeds after paying off a defaulted debt balance of $350.5 million to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest due under its debtor-in-possession loan that it borrowed in March 2015.[28]
Post Bankruptcy[edit]
NII Holdings exited bankruptcy with court approval on June 29, 2015. [29] where it offered 100 million shares of new common stock and $745 million in cash to its debt holders under its old stock ticker NIHD. In September of the same year, NII Holdings announced that they sold forty-nine percent of Nextel Argentina to Grupo Clarin further reducing their operations in the Argentinian Market in order to support their growing Brazilian operations.[30]
Sale of Nextel Argentina[edit]
On January 29, 2016 NII Holdings completed selling its remaining shares of Nextel Argentina to Clarín Group.[31]

In Good Financial Health? – NII Holdings, Inc. (NIHD), Platform Specialty Products Corporation (PAH)

By Grady Hoffman -   June 20, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of NII Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:NIHD) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 99.83% since bottoming out at $0.361 on May. 12, 2017. Thanks to a rise of almost 2.18% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -66.45% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -81.78% from $3.73 , the 52-week high touched on Jun. 20, 2016, but are collecting gains at -81.31% for the past 12 months.
Is It Worth the Risk?
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to sell NII Holdings, Inc. (NIHD)’s shares projecting a $1 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company’s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don’t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company’s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio – such as a price-to-earnings ratio – to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.
Revenue Growth Rates
 NIHD’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -31.2% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 10.8% looks attractive.
Comparing Profitability





 While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company’s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That’s why this number shouldn’t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company’s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, NII Holdings, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -157.88%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 6.19%, and the sector’s average is 25%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector.
 Platform Specialty Products Corporation (NYSE:PAH) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -13.29% since hitting a peak level of $14.37 on Apr. 27, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -3.71% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 27.01% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 81.9% higher from $6.85, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Oct. 13, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 29.25% for the past six months.
Trading The Odds
 The good news is there’s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $12.46, PAH has a chance to add $2.36 or 18.94% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($14.82) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.3 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 3.13 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
EPS Growth Rates
 For the past 5 years, Platform Specialty Products Corporation’s EPS growth has been nearly 15.3%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 4.4%, annually.
Is it turning profits into returns?
 Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company’s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company’s ability to turn an investor’s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders’ behalf. Platform Specialty Products Corporation’s ROE is 2.69%, while industry’s is 9.92%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 14.93%.
 Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company’s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. PAH’s ROA is 0.33%, while industry’s average is 5.82%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 9.12.
