Management TeamCompany Core Values



Company History




        The story of the company began in the early 1970s, not long after the joint purchase of some
        ranchland.  On that property, one of the nations largest and purest natural carbon dioxide reservoirs
        was discovered.  We like to think of it as a pure rocky mountain spring water of naturally-occuring
        carbon dioxide.
    
    
        After pipelines were built from New Mexico to the Permian Basin, the Reliant Group was established
        in 1989 as a small family-owned company called Flo-CO2, Inc.  Our founders included Fred Vanderburg,
        Sr. and his wife Jessie Lee, Ronnie and Joy Rice, Fred Vanderburg, Jr. and his wife Sandy, and Alan
        Houk.
    

        Now the Reliant Group has branched out into multiple different companies that are able to supply carbon
        dioxide in many forms and fashions.  We can provide service in many different states across the United States and Mexico.  Our main
        product lines include bulk food and medical grade carbon dioxide, restaurant and 
        convenience store mini-bulk carbon
        dioxide, oilfield grade carbon dioxide for oilfield markets, as well as dry ice.
