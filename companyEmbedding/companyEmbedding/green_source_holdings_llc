        GSE provides licensing and consulting services for its LIQUEX® technology, which is based on a family of proprietary reagents,
        GSX®.  
    

        GSE's flagship product is its patented technology, LIQUEX®, for fossil-fuel extraction, liquefaction and/or recovery.  GSE's
        LIQUEX® technology has been demonstrated to be highly effective in liquefying, solubilizing and/or extracting bituminous matter
        comprising hydrocarbons as well as non-hydrocarbon organic matter, such as asphaltenes and resins in fossil fuels, including coal, oil
        sands, and petroleum.  The technology can be readily deployed without the aid of a catalyst, promoter, surfactant or hydrogen under very
        mild conditions in terms of temperature and pressure.
    

        The proprietary reagents are recyclable, low in toxicity, low in volatility and non-corrosive.  The technology is less costly compared to
        other known liquefaction, solubilization and/or extraction processes for hydrocarbons.  GSX® penetrates or diffuses into particles, pieces,
        blocks or chunks of hydrocarbon-containing substances at appreciable rates, subsequently releasing the liquefiable, solubilizable or
        extractable fraction in them even under or near ambient conditions of temperature and pressure, i.e., low severity, although the reagents'
        effectiveness tends to improve at slightly higher temperatures and pressures.  GSE's technology can potentially be deployed industrially
        either ex situ or in situ for all varieties of hydrocarbons.
    

        GSE's technology is based on an extraction taking place when the reagent and organic matter, mainly comprising hydrocarbons, come into direct
        contact with each other, at which time the organic matter dissolves into the reagent.  The resultant mixture of the organic matter and reagent
        forms a single-phase, i.e., homogeneous, solution which can be separated by simple distillation to capture the target hydrocarbon products and
        recycle the reagent for future application.

Coal Liquefaction
Oil Sands Extraction









Oil Sands Extraction
        
        GSE's patented LIQUEX® technology can be utilized to extract bituminous organic matter from mined oil sands (tar sands).  The LIQUEX®
        process is conducted by mixing oil sands with GSE's proprietary solvent, GSX®.  At this time, GSX® extracts and dissolves mainly
        bituminous material (i.e., hydrocarbons) as well as other organic matter from the oil sands.  The resultant mixture undergoes solid-liquid
        separation to produce a liquid stream and particulate solids.
    

        The liquid stream generally consists of GSX®, bituminous organic matter and water that is inherently present in oil sands.  Depending on the
        specific oil sands feedstock, a fraction of heavy metals and/or minerals (i.e., pollutants) may transfer to the liquid extract mixture.  If necessary,
        any pollutants present can be treated with relative ease.  GSX® is separated from the bitumen via distillation for future use in the process.
        The particulate solids are comprised of sand, clay, trace amounts of bitumen and various pollutants.
    

        The LIQUEX® technology greatly diminishes the environmental impact of extracting bitumen from mined oil sands because the process does not require
        water to perform extraction.  Water is only used to conduct equipment operations necessary during the process (e.g., water boiler for steam generation).
        Compared to other available technologies that use a large quantity of water during extraction (e.g., 6 barrels water per barrel bitumen recovered), the
        LIQUEX® process eliminates the need for tailing ponds.  GSE's proprietary solvent is also effective at ambient temperature while other technologies
        require water heated to high temperatures, which translates to utility cost savings for producers using the LIQUEX® technology.
    

        GSE's technology is feasible to extract bitumen from both low-grade and high-grade oil sands whereas other technologies cannot process lower grade oil
        sands economically.  Third-party laboratory testing has demonstrated recovery rates up to 99% using the LIQUEX® hydrocarbon extraction process.
    
	
        The recovered bitumen is representative of a heavy synthetic crude oil that can be marketed as one or more of the following products:        
    

Heavy fuel oil blend;
Fuel for electric power generation via direct combustion;
Refiner feedstock to produce transportation fuels; and
Asphalt base to produce asphalt binder.


        For oil sands producers, the potential benefits of GSE's technology include the following:
    

Maximizing bitumen extraction, including from lower grade oil sands;
Minimizing water requirements;
Reducing energy requirements;
Significantly reducing extraction time;
Enhancing the environmental sustainability of the extraction process by substantially decreasing the emission of pollutants and the generation of
            greenhouse gases, thus resulting in a low carbon footprint;
Operating a process capable of remedying the existing tailing ponds with concomitant recovery of additional bitumen;
Enabling producers to establish an economically compelling process in light of the recyclability of the reagent as well as the relative simplicity
            of the technology; and
Eliminating the need for diluent to facilitate the transport of extracted bitumen due to the viscosity-reducing property of the reagent.

Coal Liquefaction
Oil Sands Extraction









Frequently Asked Questions
Q1: What does GSE's LIQUEX® technology do?

        A1: GSE's patented LIQUEX® technology offers a low-tech, economically viable and environmentally sustainable process
        for hydrocarbon extraction and recovery using a proprietary reagent, GSX®.  GSX® has been demonstrated to be
        highly effective in liquefying, solubilizing and/or extracting bituminous matter in hydrocarbons, including coal, oil
        sands, and crude oil without the aid of any catalyst, promoter and/or surfactant.
    
Q2: How does the LIQUEX® technology work?

        A2: GSE's LIQUEX® technology is based on an extraction taking place when the reagent for the technology and organic matter,
        mainly comprising hydrocarbons, come into direct contact with each other, at which time the organic matter dissolves into
        the reagent.  The ex-situ process is conducted by blending a hydrocarbon-containing substance (e.g., coal, oil sands),
        with GSX® in a mixing vessel to perform extraction.  The GSX® extract mixture subsequently undergoes solid-liquid
        separation to produce a liquid stream and a solid residue.   The resulting liquid stream is subjected to liquid-liquid
        separation (e.g., distillation) to recover the target hydrocarbons as well as the GSX® for future use in the process. 
    
Q3: How does the LIQUEX® technology compare to alternative technologies?

        A3: GSE's technology is based on an extraction whereas many alternative technologies are based on a physical dissolution.  As a
        result, GSE's process is highly efficient and effective.  The technology is also "low-tech" and "low-severity," making it
        relatively easy to implement under or near ambient conditions, and requiring less utility resources than many alternatives.
        GSE's technology is also versatile, capable of being implemented both in situ and ex situ across a wide spectrum of hydrocarbon
        containing materials.
    
Q4: Why does GSE's LIQUEX® technology work better than alternative technologies?

        A4: The proprietary reagents are recyclable, low in toxicity and volatility, and less costly compared to other known liquefaction,
        solubilization and/or extraction reagents for hydrocarbons.  The proprietary reagent penetrates or diffuses into particles,
        pieces, blocks or chunks of hydrocarbon-containing substances through their pores at appreciable rates, subsequently releasing
        the liquefiable, solubilizable or extractable fraction in them often almost completely even under or near ambient temperature
        and atmospheric pressure.  
    
Q5: Is there a limited supply of GSX®?

        A5: Ample quantities of feedstock for GSX® is produced worldwide every year.
    
Q6: What are the benefits of GSE's technology for coal producers?

        A6: For coal production, the benefits of GSE's technology include:
    

Expanding the marketability of coal, including lower grade coal, by yielding two higher value-added products;
Liquefying coal directly without the aid of a catalyst, promoter and/or surfactant;
Removing the risk of operating coal-liquefaction plants under extremely high temperature and pressure;
Enhancing the environmental sustainability of the liquefaction process;
Lowering capital and operating costs compared to alternative coal liquefaction technologies;
Enabling producers to establish an economically compelling process in light of the recyclability of the reagent as well as
            the relative simplicity of the technology; and
Minimizing the required utilities and carbon footprint from the process.

Q7: What are the benefits of GSE's technology for oil sands producers?

        A7: For oil sands production, the benefits of this technology include:
    

Maximizing bitumen extraction, including from lower grade oil sands;
Minimizing water requirements;
Reducing energy requirements;
Significantly reducing extraction time;
Enhancing the environmental sustainability of the extraction process by substantially decreasing the emission of pollutants
            and the generation of greenhouse gases, thus resulting in a low carbon footprint;
Operating a process capable of remedying the existing tailing ponds with concomitant recovery of additional bitumen;
Enabling producers to establish an economically compelling process in light of the recyclability of the reagent as well as
            the relative simplicity of the technology; and
Eliminating the need for diluent to facilitate the transport of extracted bitumen due to the viscosity-reducing property of
            the reagent.

Q8: How does GSE's LIQUEX® technology work for coal liquefaction?

        A8: Ground coal is blended with GSE's proprietary solvent, GSX®, in a simple mixing vessel at ambient pressure and temperature
        to dissolve bituminous material as well as other organic matter from the coal.  The resultant mixture undergoes solid-liquid
        separation to produce a liquid stream and particulate solids.  The liquid stream generally consists of GSX®, coal derived
        liquid (CDL) and moisture from the coal.  Depending on the specific coal feedstock, a fraction of heavy metals and/or minerals
        (i.e., pollutants) may transfer to the liquid extract mixture.  If necessary, any pollutants present can be treated with relative
        ease.  GSX® is separated from CDL via distillation for future use in the process.  The particulate solids comprises material
        originally present in the mined coal less the CDL, the majority of moisture and any pollutants not removed during extraction.
        The process results in two potentially higher value added products: (1) a coal derived liquid comprised mainly of hydrocarbons,
        and (2) a low moisture solid coal.
    
Q9: How does GSE's LIQUEX® technology work for oil sands?

        A9: Oil sands is blended with GSE's proprietary solvent, GSX®, in a simple mixing vessel at ambient pressure and temperature to
        dissolve bituminous organic matter from the oil sands.  The resultant mixture undergoes solid-liquid separation to produce a liquid
        stream and particulate solids.  The liquid stream generally consists of GSX®, bituminous organic matter and water that is inherently
        present in oil sands.  Depending on the specific oil sands feedstock, a fraction of heavy metals and/or minerals (i.e., pollutants) may
        transfer to the liquid extract mixture.  If necessary, any pollutants present can be treated with relative ease.  GSX® is separated
        from the recovered bitumen via distillation for future use in the process.  The particulate solids are comprised of sand, clay, trace
        amounts of bitumen and any pollutants not removed during extraction.  GSE's technology is feasible to extract bitumen from both low-grade
        and high-grade oil sands whereas other technologies cannot process lower grade oil sands economically, i.e., value of bitumen recovered
        using conventional technologies cannot offset production costs.
    
Q10: Are there any environmental issues associated with GSE's technology?

        A10: Under the federal laws and regulations of the United States, GSE does not anticipate that storage, use or disposal of the proprietary
        reagent, GSX®, would trigger onerous or significant environmental compliance issues, provided customary protocols for chemical handling
        are followed.  For purposes of manufacture, import and export, all of the key component chemicals of the GSE proprietary reagent, GSX®,
        were found to be on the USEPA's Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) Inventory by name, by an alternative name or by family.  Additionally, a
        third party study of scientific literature of the effects of exposure to the chemical components of GSX® for humans, animals and the environment
        was conducted.  The study found the chemicals to be of low toxicity and the use of GSX® is not expected to produce untoward effects when
        proper diligence and care is taken in the handling, transportation, use, and disposal of this product.
    
Q11: Is GSE’s technology patented?

        A11: GSE has multiple patents granted and pending in the United States and numerous countries around the world for its technologies.
    
Q12: What does Green Source Energy® provide through its GSX® and LIQUEX® licensing and consulting services programs?

        A12: The GSX® and LIQUEX® licensing and consulting services programs provide licenses and related consulting and technology information
        necessary for implementing GSE's respective proprietary and patented technologies.  For example, for coal liquefaction, the LIQUEX® services
        would include engineering, design and operating details and related consulting services for using GSE's proprietary hydrocarbon extraction process
        and related GSX® services necessary to use GSE's proprietary formulation(s) for the application.

About Green Source Energy

                GSE was founded in 2007 by opinion leaders in oil exploration, chemical engineering and process technology with decades of operational
                and R&D experience.  GSE is a division of Green Source Holdings LLC that develops and licenses patented technologies to enhance
                hydrocarbon recovery.  We offer novel solutions while reducing the energy and natural resources expended in the process.  The name
                Green Source Energy® reflects the company’s focus on developing technologies that will unlock resources in a more environmentally
                friendly way than current alternatives.
            


What We Do

                GSE's vision is to revolutionize hydrocarbon recovery through our ground-breaking technologies.  GSE recognizes that hydrocarbons will
                remain a critical resource for the foreseeable future, even as alternative energy technologies are developed.  We want to make hydrocarbon
                recovery as efficient and effective as possible to extend these resources and to reduce the environmental impact of the recovery process.
                GSE's business is the development, marketing and licensing of its patented and patent-pending technologies and related services and products.
            


Technology

                GSE's flagship product is its patented technology, LIQUEX®, for fossil-fuel extraction, liquefaction and/or recovery.  GSE's
                LIQUEX® technology has been demonstrated to be highly effective in liquefying, solubilizing and/or extracting bituminous matter
                comprising hydrocarbons as well as non-hydrocarbon organic matter, such as asphaltenes and resins in fossil fuels, including coal, oil
                sands, and petroleum.  The technology can be readily deployed without the aid of a catalyst, promoter, surfactant or hydrogen under
                very mild conditions in terms of temperature and pressure.

A New Spin On Old Tires 


            Austin Rubber          
A Green Source Holdings LLC Company












About Austin Rubber Company
Austin Rubber Company LLC manufactures a virgin rubber compound substitute, APX®, using an environmentally friendly, patented process. Our sustainable solution converts recycled tires and other vulcanized scrap rubber compounds into a less expensive substitute for virgin rubber, which can be used in a variety of new products.

Green Source Holdings
builds businesses around disruptive resource efficiency opportunities.







 




Green Source was founded in 2007 by opinion leaders in chemical engineering, oil and gas, and technology development with decades of operational, finance and R&D experience.
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, we have operations in Texas, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.





Green Source seeks business opportunities that use technology to solve resource efficiency issues.
Key elements of our businesses include:




1
Sustainable Commerce
We seek to promote sustainable commerce, which we define as businesses that use an original resource in multiple, value-added reincarnations (or upcycling) with compelling inherent economic value.  We focus on materials recycling and heavy industry, because these industries are underserved in the investment community, so many great ideas are going undeveloped.


2
Intellectual Property
We build businesses that are IP heavy and can use that as a competitive edge.  Our experience with IP enables us to develop sophisticated strategies to protect business opportunities through comprehensive strategies.


3
Value for Stakeholders
Our businesses provide value for all stakeholders without relying on government subsidies or mandates.  Our philosophy is that, to be truly sustainable, business opportunities must offer inherent value for customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders.









To take advantage of these opportunities, Green Source Holdings is organized into five business units.






 

Austin Rubber Company
Austin Rubber produces a high quality, lower cost substitute for virgin rubber compounds made from recycled tires and other scrap rubber, called APX®.  Our goal is to revolutionize the scrap rubber market to create a feedstock that can be used in higher value products, such as footwear, auto parts and tires – upcycling vs simple recycling.
Learn More




 

Tredagain
Tredagain develops and markets high quality footwear products that move sustainability beyond a marketing talking point into reality.   It does this by incorporating Austin Rubber’s APX® to provide the only high quality footwear that uses 50% recycled tires in the outsole.  
Learn More




 

Octavo Systems
Octavo Systems is a leading edge Electronic System Integration company, leveraging System-In-Package technology to deliver innovative products to its customers, allowing for quicker, smaller, and more cost effective electronic systems.
Learn More

 


 

Green Source Energy®
GSE develops environmentally sustainable methods for recovering hydrocarbons from unconventional sources, including coal and oil sands. The technology uses a chemical-based, low severity process that does not use water and minimizes its environmental footprint.
Learn More




 

GS Technology
GS Technology is Green Source's incubator for earlier stage technologies under development, including chemical additives that prevent corrosion, recycling shingles to reclaim asphalt binder for use as a virgin binder substitute, and recycling mixed plastics.

Privacy Notice Green Source Holdings LLC’s (“GSH”) Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by GSH anytime you interact with GSH or our subsidiaries, such as when you visit our web site, when you purchase products and services from GSH companies, or when you call our sales or support associates. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at GSH, and we go to great lengths to protect it.
Why we collect personal information
We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements and changes, special offers, quality control, warranty information, and events that you might like to hear about.
If you do not want GSH to keep you up to date with GSH news and the latest information on products and services, you may opt-out by sending an email to info@greensourceholdings.com. Please be sure to include your full name, address, phone number and e-mail address, as well as the specific changes you would like to make. This will ensure we correctly identify you in our systems and accurately process your request.
GSH will take the appropriate steps to modify your preferences with respect to our marketing communications. Due to production, mailing and system timelines, it may take some time to process your request. Until your requested change takes effect, you may still receive marketing communications from us.
Although you may have opted not to receive marketing communications, you may still receive business-related communications such as order confirmations, product recall notices, or other related communications.
What information we collect and how we may use it
As part of your interaction with GSH, we may collect personal information such as contact information, including name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address and contact preferences. We may also collect demographic information, including age, personal interests and product preferences. While shopping or taking advantage of services available from us, we may ask that you provide personal information. For example, we may request personal information when you:

Purchase products or services
Set up an account online
Participate in a promotion or survey
Contact us with a question or concern
Participate in other activities with GSH

There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products and services. For example, we use the personal information you provide for purposes including, but not limited to:

Fulfilling requests for information
Providing customer services
Administering promotions or surveys
Offering new products and services
Improving the effectiveness of our web sites, our marketing endeavors and our services and offers
Conducting auditing, research, and analysis to improve GSH’s products and web sites
Sending marketing communications
Performing other business activities as needed

Publicly displayed information is public
If you use a bulletin board or chat room on a GSH web site, you should be aware that any information you share is visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. GSH is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, GSH will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.
When we disclose your information
GSH takes your privacy very seriously. GSH does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers.
Within the GSH Group
To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with our affiliates who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with GSH’s privacy policy.
With our service providers, vendors, and strategic partners
GSH may share your personal information with certain third parties such as our agents, service providers and other representatives acting on our behalf for limited purposes. For example, we may share personal information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as:

Sending GSH marketing communications
Providing services
Conducting research, analysis or administering surveys
Sending regular mail and e-mail on behalf of GSH

The third parties with whom we conduct business are authorized to use your information only to perform the service for which they are hired. They are required to abide by the terms of our Privacy Policy including taking reasonable measures to ensure your personal information is secure.
We may also share aggregated data with third parties for analysis and research purposes. This data does not contain name, address or other personally identifiable information.
From time to time, we may be required to share personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may share certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of others and ourselves. We may also transfer personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event.
How we protect your personal information
GSH takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. GSH cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail, and you do so at your own risk.
You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.
Integrity of your personal information
GSH has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided.
Children
GSH recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults may purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the GSH purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to GSH and we learn that that personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
Cookies and other technologies
As is standard practice on many corporate web sites, GSH’s web site may use “cookies” and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We may also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our web site, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we may use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.
If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, please consult your web browser instructions for the necessary steps how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the GSH web site will not be available once cookies are disabled.
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
Our Web server automatically collects clickstream information such as the address (or URL) of the web site that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered on our site, among other things. Our Web site may also use other technologies to track which pages our visitors view. This anonymous clickstream data provides our customers with a better experience and helps GSH understand how visitors use our web site.
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. GSH will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.
In some of our email messages we may use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the GSH web site. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
In addition we may use pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our web site customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.
Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a customer.
Third Party Sites
This Privacy Policy may not apply to web sites that are accessible through GSH’s web site. Our Web sites contain links to other sites operated by third parties, including but not limited to third-party sites that display GSH trademarks. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other sites to learn how they collect, use, share and secure your information.
Privacy Policy Changes
As GSH continues to improve the services, products and the features we provide, this policy is subject to change. If there are changes or additions to this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here or in other formats for you to review. If we change our information practices or this Privacy Policy in such a way that your personal information may be used or shared in a manner not described in the Privacy Policy at the time you provided it, we will give you the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used or shared in that new manner.
Privacy questions
If you have questions or concerns about GSH’s Customer Privacy Policy or data processing, please send an email to info@greensourceholdings.com to contact us.
