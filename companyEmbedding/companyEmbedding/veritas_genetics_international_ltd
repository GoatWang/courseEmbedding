About Veritas



We are a passionate and dynamic group of scientists, engineers, genetic counselors, business folk, and designers. Our goal: empower people to live healthier, longer.
But, our story began in the 1970s with a young student passionate about one thing, DNA. George Church's work set in motion countless genetic discoveries, including the Human Genome Project, the first initiative to map all genes in the human genome.
George, along with a group of visionaries and scientists, including leaders from Harvard Medical School's Personal Genome Project, co-founded Veritas.

About Veritas



We are a passionate and dynamic group of scientists, engineers, genetic counselors, business folk, and designers. Our goal: empower people to live healthier, longer.
But, our story began in the 1970s with a young student passionate about one thing, DNA. George Church's work set in motion countless genetic discoveries, including the Human Genome Project, the first initiative to map all genes in the human genome.
George, along with a group of visionaries and scientists, including leaders from Harvard Medical School's Personal Genome Project, co-founded Veritas.

Veritas Genetics MyGenome

Mar 03, 2016

 



Veritas Genomics has launched myGenome, which the company claims is the world's first whole genome for less than $1,000, including interpretation and genetic counseling. Veritas first made $999 whole genome sequencing available to nearly 5,000 participants in the Personal Genome Project at Harvard Medical School. Veritas myGenome sequencing is performed in a CLIA laboratory, includes genetic counseling for clinically relevant conditions, and requires a physician order. The company said it is building a platform for myGenome that will include a secure digital report and app, access to a patient's genome data, on-demand genetic counseling, lifestyle-relevant genetic information, access to physicians, and omics data integration. This service is currently available for pre-orders in the US and other countries will be added in the coming months, the company said.

We sequence your whole genome.







Your genome is your complete set of DNA - and it is 6 billion letters long (A, T, C, Gs). Sequencing your whole genome, as opposed to only looking at a small part of your genome, matters because:

We can provide you with deeper & truly actionable insights based on your genetics.
Whole genome sequence gives a powerful resource for life. Sequence once, get useful insights for life.
















GENOTYPING
<1 million DNA letters (bases)
~0.02% of the genome
(e.g. 23andMe)



EXOME SEQUENCE
~50 million DNA letters (bases)
~1.5% of the genome


WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCE
6 billion DNA letters (bases)











WHOLE GENOMESEQUENCE
6 billion DNAletters






90% of the important DNA elements are distributed across the genome. You can only access these with whole genome sequencing.













Over 25% of people

...have a genetic susceptibility to dangers of dietary iron excess, which predisposes them to significantly higher risk of serious diseases including Alzheimerʼs.
By sequencing your whole genome, we can identify the genetic variants associated with these risks and can therefore guide you to dietary modifications to mitigate these risks as well as proper therapeutic interventions, if necessary.
FOR EXAMPLE
A variant [H63D c.187C>G] was detected in your HFE gene
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
Variants in HFE are associated with a condition called hereditary hemochromatosis. You carry one “non-working” gene, which means that your body might not regulate intake of the iron in your food appropriately. If so, you might need to assess your consumption of iron-rich foods and adjust your diet.

You canʼt open a magazine without reading about Omega-3 this and Omega-6 that.



While a proper balance of Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, your genetics have a key role to play in your ability to absorb these fatty acids.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR GENOTYPE
GGYour genotype is associated with lower serum levels of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats.
Responses to Omega-6 and Omega-3 fats (FADS1 c.1248+52A>G)You may consider increasing your consumption of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats through diet or supplements. We also recommend you discuss this further with your healthcare provider.
Proper balance of Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Lower total cholesterol, lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and higher HDL (often referred to as “good”) cholesterol are also associated with a reduced cancer risk. Very high consumption of Omega-6 and 3 fats is associated with certain health problems.

We know that newborns with genetic diseases are rare,

but knowing what genetic conditions you and your partner carry can help you understand the risks and plan better. Learn if you are a carrier of a genetic condition and what you could pass on to your children. In addition, our genetic counselors will help you understand your results, for example;
You are a carrier of Phenylketonuria (PKU)
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
You carry one ‘non-workingʼ gene for PKU (also known as PAH deficiency). Carriers do not show or develop symptoms of PKU, however if you are planning a family, this variant can be passed down to your children. Since PKU affects children who have 2 ‘non-workingʼ copies of the PAH gene, pregnancies are only at risk when both parents are carriers.
Genetic testing for your partner and other relatives may be considered and should be discussed with your healthcare provider and/or genetic counselor.

We have all tried medications that donʼt work for us.



Our bodies may metabolize and respond to drugs differently due to our genetics. This is called pharmacogenomics. myGenome provides insights on how you may respond to over 150 drugs.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR GENOTYPE
CCA dosage change may be required for Simvastatin
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
Simvastatin (trade name Zocor) is a drug used to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Based on your CC genotype for the SLC01B1 gene, you may require a dosage change. Please consult your doctor before making any dosage changes.

Why should you get screened?




The BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are part of your body’s natural defense system. They protect you from developing certain cancers. If you have a BRCA gene that is not working properly (meaning, it carries a harmful mutation), your lifetime risk of developing breast, ovarian and other cancers increases significantly.1,2











BRCA mutations can significantly increase your lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.1,2




A BRCA mutation can increase the lifetime risk of breast cancer in women from 12% to up to 80% by age 80.3




12%

general population risk




up to 80%

with BRCA mutation




A BRCA mutation can increase the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in women from 1.3% to up to 40% by age 80.3




1.3%
