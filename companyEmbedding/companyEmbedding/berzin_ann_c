Video of 2011 Keynote Speaker: Ann C. Berzin, AB &#039;74, JD &#039;77

      Summary    


	Ann C. Berzin, AB '74, JD '77 Corporate Board Member Constellation Energy, Ingersoll-Rand, Kindred Healthcare Ann Berzin is a 1974 graduate of The College and a 1977 graduate of the Law School. She worked in New York City as both a law firm associate and later, partner, specializing in municipal finance and asset backed securitization. She left law firm practice to help start a financial guaranty company, FGIC, and was with the company through three successive major changes: its start-up phase with large institutional owners, its later phase as a public company listed on the NYSE, and finally when it became part of a very large corporate organization as a division of the General Electric Company. Within FGIC, she began as its general counsel and member of its risk underwriting committee, later moved from the legal department to head its new product development organization and later became its Chairman and CEO. Feeling acutely the challenges of raising her three children with a husband who did international mergers and acquisitions work and traveled extensively, Ms. Berzin left FGIC and began to join NYSE listed public companies as a director. She currently serves as a director of Ingersoll-Rand, Constellation Energy Group, Inc., and Kindred Healthcare, Inc., and serves on the Audit Committee of each company, as well as on other board committees. She is married and the mother of three children, ages 21, 17, and 14. Ms. Berzin has been actively involved with the University and has served on the Visiting Committee for the College and Student Activities since 2002 and as chair since 2007. This panel was filmed as part of Taking the Next Step 2011. For more information visit: https://takingthenextstep.uchicago.edu/
