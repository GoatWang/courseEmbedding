Understanding risk is the key to building portfolios
We believe fixed-income risk should be divided into four categories: credit risk, interest-rate risk, prepayment risk, and liquidity risk. Different asset types may display different combinations of these risks, or be wholly aligned with just one of them. Having exposure to different types of fixed-income assets does not necessarily diversify a portfolio in terms of risk.
With a more comprehensive view of fixed-income risk, we can pursue a broader range of return sources. We regard this to be an advantage over investors positioned only for falling interest rates. We determine the risk profile of each fixed-income security, and construct portfolios to reflect the combination of risks that we find most worth taking. We can tap into a much broader range of potential fixed-income opportunities beyond those captured by the most common bond benchmarks — the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index.
We believe today's most attractive opportunities lie outside the index.
Sectors with yields higher than their historical norms may offer compelling investment opportunities.

* This chart calculates an average OAS using the 10-year period ended 3/31/17 for two reasons. First, we believe this period covers a sufficient breadth of economic and market conditions to generate a representative long-term "average" OAS for the fixed-income security types under consideration. Second, it excludes the period of unprecedentedly wide OAS levels that occurred during the financial crisis beginning in 2008.

Discover how Putnam has actively managed duration risk during this rate cycle.


Sources: Bloomberg, Putnam, as of 3/31/17.
Data is provided for informational use only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All spreads are in basis points and measure option-adjusted yield spread relative to comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries with the exception of non-agency RMBS and mezzanine CMBS, which are loss-adjusted spreads to swaps calculated using Putnam's projected assumptions on defaults and severities, and agency IO, which is calculated using assumptions derived from Putnam's proprietary prepayment model. Agencies are represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Agency Index. Agency MBS are represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index. Investment-grade corporates are represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index. High yield is represented by JPMorgan Developed High Yield Index. CMBS is represented by both agency and non-agency CMBS that are eligible for inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; mezzanine CMBS is represented by the same index using the AA, A and BBB components. Average OAS for Mezzanine CMBS is for the 2000-2007 time period. Emerging-market debt is represented by the Bloomberg Barclays EM Hard Currency Aggregate Index. Non-agency RMBS is estimated using average market level of a sample of below-investment-grade securities backed by various types of non-agency mortgage collateral (excluding prime securities). Mezzanine CMBS is estimated from an average spread among baskets of Putnam-monitored new issue and seasoned mezzanine securities, as well as a synthetic (CMBX) index. Agency IO is estimated from a basket of Putnam-monitored interest-only (IO) and inverse IO securities. Option-adjusted spread (OAS) measures the yield over duration equivalent Treasuries for securities with different embedded options.

Management team






Gerard P. Sullivan (industry since 1982)




Strategy and process

"Go anywhere" approach: The fund invests in stocks of U.S. companies of all sizes, with the flexibility to own both growth and value stocks.
A disciplined process: The portfolio manager uses a disciplined bottom-up fundamental investment process that focuses on three buckets of idea generation.
Research focus: Backed by a Global Equity Research team, the portfolio manager uses his stock-picking expertise to identify opportunities and manage risk.



 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.



Objective
The fund seeks capital appreciation.

Perspectives





The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The Russell 3000 Index is an unmanaged index of the 3,000 largest U.S. companies. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Investments in small and/or midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments, and value stocks may fail to rebound. Stock prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions and factors related to a specific issuer or industry. You can lose money by investing in the fund.

Value benefits from an expanding economy
Value stocks have lagged the market in 2017, but if the economy continues to expand, rates rise, and the yield curve steepens, this trend could reverse.

While a diversified portfolio should include both growth and value, today’s valuations and economy point to a value cycle.

Headlines you need to know this week   —   July 25, 2017






Is it better to retire outside of the United States?
In a global study that ranked countries on their ability to offer citizens a secure retirement, the ranking for the United States dropped to 17, from a ranking of 14 last year. Factors that contributed to the U.S. drop included scores on income equality, health-care spending, and life expectancy. Among the 43 developed counties in the study, Norway ranked number 1.







Paying down debt a priority for younger investors
The majority of millennials in a recent survey cited their financial situation as their most important personal matter, and paying down debt as their top priority. Saving for retirement ranked fifth among concerns. A full 73% cited the internet as a leading source of financial advice, while 63% cited friends and family.







Fear of stocks could cost millennials $3.3 million
A number of surveys point to a fear among millennials about investing in stocks, mainly due to the fact that sometimes prices drop. According to analysis from NerdWallet, if millennials stash their retirement savings in a bank account, they may find themselves 40 years later with $3.3 million to $4 million less than if they had invested in stocks.

‡ As of May 8, 2017, Putnam High Yield Advantage Fund was renamed to Putnam High Yield Fund.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expense limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.


For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

‡ As of May 8, 2017, Putnam High Yield Advantage Fund was renamed to Putnam High Yield Fund.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expense limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.


For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

‡ As of May 8, 2017, Putnam High Yield Advantage Fund was renamed to Putnam High Yield Fund.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expense limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.


For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

PUTNAM PERSPECTIVES

Value benefits from an expanding economy
Value stocks have lagged the market in 2017, but if the economy continues to expand, rates rise, and the yield curve steepens, this trend could reverse.


ECONOMIC UPDATES AND MARKET OUTLOOKS

Currency: Don't look to the dollar for leadership
The U.S. dollar outlook continues to be most heavily influenced by the Fed, as expectations for fiscal policy have been pushed beyond the investment horizon.

Putnam Investments, LLC
  Brotherston et al v.  Putnam Investments, LLC et al. Case No.  1:15-cv-13825 (D.  Mass.) 

 On November 13, 2015, we filed a lawsuit on behalf of participants in the Putnam Retirement Plan (the “Plan”) against the Plan’s fiduciaries. The lawsuit alleges that the Defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) by promoting their own mutual fund business and maximizing profits at the expense of the Plan and its participants. Among other things, the lawsuit alleges that the Defendants filled the Plan exclusively with Putnam’s own high-cost, poor performing mutual funds without regard to whether Plan participants would be better served by other investments. The lawsuit alleges that the selection of these proprietary mutual funds cost Plan participants millions of dollars in excess fees. The lawsuit further alleges that the Defendants added funds with little to no performance history and failed to remove poor performing funds from the Plan. The lawsuit seeks to recover the Plan’s financial losses and to obtain equitable and other relief from the Defendants as a remedy for their violations of ERISA.
A copy of the complaint is here.

Case Status Updates


Updated 06/22/2016

Putnam Investments, LLC UpdateOn January 8, 2016, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Both sides then submitted briefs to the court on the merits of the motion. The Court held a hearing on the Defendant’s motions on March 9, 2016, and on April 7, 2016, the Court denied the motion to dismiss in full. 
What Is A Class Action?In a class action lawsuit, one or more people, called the “class representatives,” sue on behalf of themselves and other people who have similar claims. Together, this group of people is called a “class” or “class members.” The class representative and the class members together are called the “Plaintiffs.” The companies they sue are called the “Defendants.” The judge or jury resolves the claims for everyone in the class—except those who ask to be excluded from the lawsuit.
Who is Included?The lawsuit is being brought on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries of the Putnam Retirement Plan at any time on or after November 13, 2009.  Excluded from this class are Defendants, their directors, and any employees with responsibility for the Plan’s investment or administrative functions.
How Long Will This Case Take?Class actions can often take many years.  Please check this page periodically for updates on the case’s status.
How Can I Help?As part of our investigatory efforts, we are interested in speaking with others who believe they have been shortchanged by excessive fees and poor investment options within their retirement plan.
You may contact us toll free at 1-877-448-0492, write to us at Nichols Kaster, PLLP, 4600 IDS Center, 80 South Eighth Street, Minneapolis, MN 55402, or email our class action clerk, Steve Eiden, at seiden@nka.com. You may also check this site for periodic updates.

Understanding risk is the key to building portfolios
We believe fixed-income risk should be divided into four categories: credit risk, interest-rate risk, prepayment risk, and liquidity risk. Different asset types may display different combinations of these risks, or be wholly aligned with just one of them. Having exposure to different types of fixed-income assets does not necessarily diversify a portfolio in terms of risk.
With a more comprehensive view of fixed-income risk, we can pursue a broader range of return sources. We regard this to be an advantage over investors positioned only for falling interest rates. We determine the risk profile of each fixed-income security, and construct portfolios to reflect the combination of risks that we find most worth taking. We can tap into a much broader range of potential fixed-income opportunities beyond those captured by the most common bond benchmarks — the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index.
We believe today's most attractive opportunities lie outside the index.
Sectors with yields higher than their historical norms may offer compelling investment opportunities.

* This chart calculates an average OAS using the 10-year period ended 3/31/17 for two reasons. First, we believe this period covers a sufficient breadth of economic and market conditions to generate a representative long-term "average" OAS for the fixed-income security types under consideration. Second, it excludes the period of unprecedentedly wide OAS levels that occurred during the financial crisis beginning in 2008.

Data is provided for informational use only. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All spreads are in basis points and measure option-adjusted yield spread relative to comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries with the exception of non-agency RMBS and mezzanine CMBS, which are loss-adjusted spreads to swaps calculated using Putnam's projected assumptions on defaults and severities, and agency IO, which is calculated using assumptions derived from Putnam's proprietary prepayment model. Agencies are represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Agency Index. Agency MBS are represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Mortgage Backed Securities Index. Investment-grade corporates are represented by Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index. High yield is represented by JPMorgan Developed High Yield Index. CMBS is represented by both agency and non-agency CMBS that are eligible for inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; mezzanine CMBS is represented by the same index using the AA, A and BBB components. Average OAS for Mezzanine CMBS is for the 2000-2007 time period. Emerging-market debt is represented by the Bloomberg Barclays EM Hard Currency Aggregate Index. Non-agency RMBS is estimated using average market level of a sample of below-investment-grade securities backed by various types of non-agency mortgage collateral (excluding prime securities). Mezzanine CMBS is estimated from an average spread among baskets of Putnam-monitored new issue and seasoned mezzanine securities, as well as a synthetic (CMBX) index. Agency IO is estimated from a basket of Putnam-monitored interest-only (IO) and inverse IO securities. Option-adjusted spread (OAS) measures the yield over duration equivalent Treasuries for securities with different embedded options.

Overview[edit]
Putnam is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and has offices in London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Sydney, and Singapore.[4] It is a subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco and as of June 2017 managed $183 billion in assets across 80 mutual funds, 100 institutional clients, and 5 million shareholders and participants.[3] It is currently owned by the Power Financial Corporation.
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1937 by George Putnam who established one of the first balanced mutual funds: The George Putnam Fund of Boston. Lawrence Lasser joined the company in 1969 and it became "one of the largest managers of mutual funds."[5]
In 1997, Putnam Investments established a connection with Nippon Life Insurance in Osaka, Japan, and its subsidiary Nissay Asset Management Company.[6]
2000 to 2006[edit]
The year 2000 marked the beginning of a gradual asset value decline that took Putnam's asset value from $400 billion to $192 billion.[7]
In October 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Massachusetts Secretary of State each filed separate civil complaints against Putnam, alleging that the company's portfolio managers, along with some preferred clients, had engaged in the rapid trading of some of Putnam's mutual funds. A few days later, Lasser resigned and Charles "Ed" Haldeman, director of one of the company’s investment divisions, was promoted to chief executive.[8]
Between 2003 and 2007 Haldeman initiated broad changes within the company. He created a new set of guiding principles for the company and reduced the company's staff by 11 percent, including the elimination of 25 of the highest-paid executive positions. He reduced senior management compensation to half of what it was in 2000 and adjusted portfolio managers compensation to encourage more long term thinking and planning.[8]
In early 2004, the company admitted to allowing its portfolio managers and some investors to market time its funds. Under agreements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Putnam paid $110 million in fines and restitution to settle charges with the state and federal regulators.[9] After allegations of improper trading became public, Putnam's investors withdrew at least $28 billion from its stock and bond funds over a six-month period.[5] By May, 70 civil actions had been filed against Putnam for allegedly engaging in improper trading.[5]
In 2005, Putnam paid $40 million to settle charges made in 2003 that it "did not tell fund investors or directors about paying" brokerage firms for recommending its mutual funds to clients.[10] Afterward, some investors withdrew their funds.[7] This settlement was the final resolution in an investigation of Putnam’s payments to 80 brokers that was conducted over a three-year period.[10]
Efforts to rebuild the company paid off and in 2006, 48 percent of the Putnam's mutual funds scored in the top 50 percent when compared with funds in their peer group, an increase of 8 percent from two years prior.[8] However, that same year, an SEC lawsuit accused several former employees, including their transfer agency chief, of "defrauding several mutual funds and a corporate retirement plan of $4 million" so they could "cover up an investment-processing error." The lawsuit was in reference to an asset transfer to the Cardinal Health plan that was intentionally delayed by one day in January 2001. After failing to take advantage of a $4 million windfall, Putnam executives covered up the incident and attributed the loss to other mutual funds.[11]
2007 to Present[edit]
In February 2007, Great-West Lifeco, which is controlled by Power Corporation of Canada, announced it would acquire Putnam Investments, a "troubled mutual fund manager," from the Marsh & McLennan Companies for the approximate price of $3.9 billion.[7][12] The acquisition of Putnam was motivated by Great-West Lifeco's 2005 decision to expand into the United States.[7] The following month, Putnam received the 2007 Optimas Award for Ethical Practice in recognition of its then-recent efforts to create a more ethical company culture.[8]
In June 2007, two of Putnam's former managing directors agreed to each pay a $400,000 civil penalty to settle charges of improper trading of mutual fund shares according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two directors also agreed to a one-year suspension from any role as an investment advisor. They settled their charges without any admission or denial of guilt.[13] That same month, Lasser, Putnam's former chief executive, agreed to pay $75,000 as a settlement against accusations by the Security and Exchanges Commission that he "failed to disclose that the investment company used fund assets to pay brokerage firms for preferred marketing agreements."[10]
In 2008, Haldeman was replaced by Robert L. Reynolds who was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Putnam Investments.[14] In November, Reynolds told the Financial Times that he would restructure the company by merging several equity funds, basing compensation on performance, and laying off 47 workers including managers.[15]
On September 18, 2008, Putnam directors voted to liquidate its $12.3 billion Putnam Prime Money Market Fund and return capital to its approximately 155 professional investors.[16][17] According to a statement issued by the company, the decision came as a result of "significant redemption pressure." The fund's board of trustees decided that "selling assets to meet redemption [obligations] would risk losses for the remaining investors."[17]
In 2009, according to a Putnam press release, Reynolds designed a 10-point plan and launched an effort calling for public and private collaboration to strengthen the nation's retirement system.[18] That year, Putnam launched the industry’s first suite of absolute return funds available to U.S. retail investors and re-entered the institutional defined contribution business with a 401(k) product offering.[19]
In 2011, Putnam received the DALBAR Service Award for the 21st consecutive year for "industry leading service to shareholders and financial professionals."[20][21]
Putnam was the first mutual fund company to implement the voluntary "Mutual Fund Protection Principles", an industry standard for compliance and investor protection.[22] Putnam also has a Risk parity strategy called the Putnam Total Return.[23]

Overview[edit]
Putnam is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and has offices in London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Sydney, and Singapore.[4] It is a subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco and as of June 2017 managed $183 billion in assets across 80 mutual funds, 100 institutional clients, and 5 million shareholders and participants.[3] It is currently owned by the Power Financial Corporation.

After failing to take advantage of a $4 million windfall, Putnam executives covered up the incident and attributed the loss to other mutual funds.[11]
2007 to Present[edit]
In February 2007, Great-West Lifeco, which is controlled by Power Corporation of Canada, announced it would acquire Putnam Investments, a "troubled mutual fund manager," from the Marsh & McLennan Companies for the approximate price of $3.9 billion.[7][12] The acquisition of Putnam was motivated by Great-West Lifeco's 2005 decision to expand into the United States.[7] The following month, Putnam received the 2007 Optimas Award for Ethical Practice in recognition of its then-recent efforts to create a more ethical company culture.[8]
In June 2007, two of Putnam's former managing directors agreed to each pay a $400,000 civil penalty to settle charges of improper trading of mutual fund shares according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two directors also agreed to a one-year suspension from any role as an investment advisor. They settled their charges without any admission or denial of guilt.[13] That same month, Lasser, Putnam's former chief executive, agreed to pay $75,000 as a settlement against accusations by the Security and Exchanges Commission that he "failed to disclose that the investment company used fund assets to pay brokerage firms for preferred marketing agreements."[10]
In 2008, Haldeman was replaced by Robert L. Reynolds who was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Putnam Investments.[14] In November, Reynolds told the Financial Times that he would restructure the company by merging several equity funds, basing compensation on performance, and laying off 47 workers including managers.[15]
On September 18, 2008, Putnam directors voted to liquidate its $12.3 billion Putnam Prime Money Market Fund and return capital to its approximately 155 professional investors.[16][17] According to a statement issued by the company, the decision came as a result of "significant redemption pressure." The fund's board of trustees decided that "selling assets to meet redemption [obligations] would risk losses for the remaining investors."[17]
In 2009, according to a Putnam press release, Reynolds designed a 10-point plan and launched an effort calling for public and private collaboration to strengthen the nation's retirement system.[18] That year, Putnam launched the industry’s first suite of absolute return funds available to U.S. retail investors and re-entered the institutional defined contribution business with a 401(k) product offering.[19]
In 2011, Putnam received the DALBAR Service Award for the 21st consecutive year for "industry leading service to shareholders and financial professionals."[20][21]
Putnam was the first mutual fund company to implement the voluntary "Mutual Fund Protection Principles", an industry standard for compliance and investor protection.[22] Putnam also has a Risk parity strategy called the Putnam Total Return.[23]

Overview[edit]
Putnam is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and has offices in London, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Sydney, and Singapore.[4] It is a subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco and as of June 2017 managed $183 billion in assets across 80 mutual funds, 100 institutional clients, and 5 million shareholders and participants.[3] It is currently owned by the Power Financial Corporation.
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1937 by George Putnam who established one of the first balanced mutual funds: The George Putnam Fund of Boston. Lawrence Lasser joined the company in 1969 and it became "one of the largest managers of mutual funds."[5]
In 1997, Putnam Investments established a connection with Nippon Life Insurance in Osaka, Japan, and its subsidiary Nissay Asset Management Company.[6]
2000 to 2006[edit]
The year 2000 marked the beginning of a gradual asset value decline that took Putnam's asset value from $400 billion to $192 billion.[7]
In October 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Massachusetts Secretary of State each filed separate civil complaints against Putnam, alleging that the company's portfolio managers, along with some preferred clients, had engaged in the rapid trading of some of Putnam's mutual funds. A few days later, Lasser resigned and Charles "Ed" Haldeman, director of one of the company’s investment divisions, was promoted to chief executive.[8]
Between 2003 and 2007 Haldeman initiated broad changes within the company. He created a new set of guiding principles for the company and reduced the company's staff by 11 percent, including the elimination of 25 of the highest-paid executive positions. He reduced senior management compensation to half of what it was in 2000 and adjusted portfolio managers compensation to encourage more long term thinking and planning.[8]
In early 2004, the company admitted to allowing its portfolio managers and some investors to market time its funds. Under agreements with the SEC and the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Putnam paid $110 million in fines and restitution to settle charges with the state and federal regulators.[9] After allegations of improper trading became public, Putnam's investors withdrew at least $28 billion from its stock and bond funds over a six-month period.[5] By May, 70 civil actions had been filed against Putnam for allegedly engaging in improper trading.[5]
In 2005, Putnam paid $40 million to settle charges made in 2003 that it "did not tell fund investors or directors about paying" brokerage firms for recommending its mutual funds to clients.[10] Afterward, some investors withdrew their funds.[7] This settlement was the final resolution in an investigation of Putnam’s payments to 80 brokers that was conducted over a three-year period.[10]
Efforts to rebuild the company paid off and in 2006, 48 percent of the Putnam's mutual funds scored in the top 50 percent when compared with funds in their peer group, an increase of 8 percent from two years prior.[8] However, that same year, an SEC lawsuit accused several former employees, including their transfer agency chief, of "defrauding several mutual funds and a corporate retirement plan of $4 million" so they could "cover up an investment-processing error." The lawsuit was in reference to an asset transfer to the Cardinal Health plan that was intentionally delayed by one day in January 2001. After failing to take advantage of a $4 million windfall, Putnam executives covered up the incident and attributed the loss to other mutual funds.[11]
2007 to Present[edit]
In February 2007, Great-West Lifeco, which is controlled by Power Corporation of Canada, announced it would acquire Putnam Investments, a "troubled mutual fund manager," from the Marsh & McLennan Companies for the approximate price of $3.9 billion.[7][12] The acquisition of Putnam was motivated by Great-West Lifeco's 2005 decision to expand into the United States.[7] The following month, Putnam received the 2007 Optimas Award for Ethical Practice in recognition of its then-recent efforts to create a more ethical company culture.[8]
In June 2007, two of Putnam's former managing directors agreed to each pay a $400,000 civil penalty to settle charges of improper trading of mutual fund shares according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two directors also agreed to a one-year suspension from any role as an investment advisor. They settled their charges without any admission or denial of guilt.[13] That same month, Lasser, Putnam's former chief executive, agreed to pay $75,000 as a settlement against accusations by the Security and Exchanges Commission that he "failed to disclose that the investment company used fund assets to pay brokerage firms for preferred marketing agreements."[10]
In 2008, Haldeman was replaced by Robert L. Reynolds who was named President and Chief Executive Officer of Putnam Investments.[14] In November, Reynolds told the Financial Times that he would restructure the company by merging several equity funds, basing compensation on performance, and laying off 47 workers including managers.[15]
On September 18, 2008, Putnam directors voted to liquidate its $12.3 billion Putnam Prime Money Market Fund and return capital to its approximately 155 professional investors.[16][17] According to a statement issued by the company, the decision came as a result of "significant redemption pressure." The fund's board of trustees decided that "selling assets to meet redemption [obligations] would risk losses for the remaining investors."[17]
In 2009, according to a Putnam press release, Reynolds designed a 10-point plan and launched an effort calling for public and private collaboration to strengthen the nation's retirement system.[18] That year, Putnam launched the industry’s first suite of absolute return funds available to U.S. retail investors and re-entered the institutional defined contribution business with a 401(k) product offering.[19]
In 2011, Putnam received the DALBAR Service Award for the 21st consecutive year for "industry leading service to shareholders and financial professionals."[20][21]
Putnam was the first mutual fund company to implement the voluntary "Mutual Fund Protection Principles", an industry standard for compliance and investor protection.[22] Putnam also has a Risk parity strategy called the Putnam Total Return.[23]
