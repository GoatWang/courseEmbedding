Kodiak Canvas Tent 6133 6 Person 9 x 12 ft. with Deluxe Awning Canopy  Camp in comfort and style with this premium cabin tent from Kodiak Canvas. Keep dry in these tents made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish makes this canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Tarp Option: The 0591 12' by 9' tarp is the perfect size for this tent and is included in the displayed price for this tent. It adds an additional layer of protection to help increase the durability of your tent. The tarp can be removed for a $20.00 discount if necessary. The tarp and the tent will ship in separate boxes.Enclosure Option: One of the neatest features of this tent is that it has the ability to turn the deluxe awning into a wall, or screen enclosure. The wall enclosure zips onto the edges of the awning and completely encloses the covered area, essentially adding another 8 feet to your tent. The screen enclosure is similar to the wall enclosure in that it zips to the awning and encloses the covered area. Instead of canvas walls like the wall enclosure, the screen enclosure is made up of fine mesh, which allows you to enjoy the view, but stay safe from insects and such. The wall and tent enclosures are offered at a great promotion price of $19.99 with the tent, compared to the $99.99 separate price. The enclosures can be purchased and added on at a later date. Note: The enclosures do not include a floor, the 0591 ground tarp is closest to the correct size, but it is not a perfect fit, and can be purchased separately. Pole Bag Option: This tent already includes a place for the poles; however, due to the size and weight of the tent, many campers find it easier to carry the poles in a separate bag. This extra pole bag is the correct size to carry the tent poles in.
Other waterproof tents will easily become hot and humid inside making them very uncomfortable, but not so with Kodiak Canvas Tents. Storm Flaps are on the outside and zip up from the outside. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpour - this canvas will not leak water. The Canopy/Awning is sewn onto the roof and is supported by a sturdy metal frame. The sturdy 1 inch steel tube poles with welded corner braces will hold up to the weather. The Kodiak canvas wall tent floor is a super-duty, puncture resistant, 16 oz vinyl with welded seams that keeps water out. The tall ceiling (7.5 ft at peak) and steep walls (5.5 ft at sides) provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort.  The high quality deluxe 8 x 8.5 ft. awning creates the cool, perfect picnic area, providing shade from the sun and protection from the weather. A large front door and 1 side doors with heavy-duty #10 zippers offer convenient access.5 large windows allow ample air-flow, and have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest pests.

It''s pretty amazing
Received the tent and set it up. It's pretty amazing. The Quality top notch, my only issue " No Door Screen" on awning side door. the pole bag has a hole in it from shipping needs replacing. Anyone Who goes camping often should own this Tent. Everything about it is heavy duty made to last. Like the hanger loops inside. The floor is super heavy duty vinyl . The tent pegs are the best I've seen. I used to use large spike nails and still do with the other tents I own. These meet those standards and then some. The Awning is a must. The side Door/Window screen should zip down center and to the sides instead of from bottom up and out. minor details but heeding the advice of the end user in your design could make the product even better. I would pay for the up grades

12 x 9 tent
We bought one of these earlier this year.  We have used it many times in the rain and once in the snow even.  I was very impressed when I opened the box and saw how thick the canvas really is.  The floor is nice and the deluxe awning has been a lifesaver in the rain.  I definitely recommend this item!

The tent is great!
This is a great tent - it is well made and relatively easy to put up although it does take two people.  I wish it came in a larger size, but we purchased both the screen and enclosure to give us more room.Easy no hassle shipping

Excellent product and service
What a wonderful product.  Tested the first weekend in strong winds, rain and cold.  Excellent.  Had small heater and stayed very warm.  The enclosed awning is an excellent addition for cooking.  Service was great and quick.  Not a backpackers tent, but is a phenomenal base camp tent.  Headed out west the winter to shake it down again.

Great Tent
We spent a lot of time looking for a canvas tent. This is it!  We took it to the mountains of North Carolina during Thanksgiving.  Cold outside, warmer on the inside.  The 8X8.5 vestibule was nice, but I would suggest a small modification to extend the vertical lines of the optional enclosure along the tent edge in lieu of straight down.  We used a tarp to configure this and it gave us just a few inches extra that were not available with the enclosure.  This added more storage under our table and a bit more room for cooking.  The head room made it appear bigger than our 10 X 14 tent we had to replace.  Excellent choice if you want a sturdy well constructed base tent.

 Q: I'm interested in purchasing this tent, but it's so doggone heavy.  Does the bag that it comes in have wheels?  If not, how large is it when it's all packed up?  Maybe I can find a rolling duffel bag it can fit in.
 Asked by: Rick


 
			  - 7/10/2017

 A: The bag does not have wheels, but it does come with 3 different bags, 1 for poles, 1 for stakes, and 1 for the canvas tent. All of the other items can fit inside the main tent bag, or be carried separately. Most customers find that it is easiest to split them up and carry them 1 at a time. Altogether it weighs about 122 lbs, and the dimensions are 41” x 14” x 14”

 Q: If your tent gets soaked in a rain, how long .can I expect it to dry on a sunny day? Approximately. Thank you.
 Asked by: Rob


 
			  - 6/20/2017

 A: It should not take long to dry, as long as the air is dry. That varies greatly depending on the humidity, and original wetness. I estimate that improbably won’t take more than 6 hours.

 Q: Why don't you show the simple screen enclosure for the 6133.  I'm watching a demo which shows it (by Kodiak Canvas).  You can see it on YouTube if you search for this:  Video Tour 6133 Kodiak Canvas ?
 Asked by: Ginger


 
			  - 4/17/2017

 A: The screen enclosure is being discontinued since the wall enclosure has six large-screen windows in most customers prefer to be able to close the windows for complete privacy. Feel free to contact us with any other questions.

 Q: If I buy the 12x9 cabin without the awning canopy now and purchase the canopy later, how is it attached?  Would it be prone to leak in heavy rain at this juncture?
 Asked by: Ginger


 
			  - 4/17/2017

 A: It uses heavy-duty Velcro. It can handle a good rainstorm, but not quite as well as the actual tent. For example, there is no floor so depending on the amount of rain you could get water underneath the awning. The tent is watertight and won't get any water in. The awning along with the wall enclosure can handle most storms.

 Q: Hello again, it's easy to find information on how the FlexBows stand up to high winds, but I've had a hard time getting solid info on what to expect from the Cabin tents, as well as Cabin tent and deluxe awning and enclosure.   They are larger and less aerodynamic than the FlexBows, so there's bound to be some tradeoffs.  Can you help me understand what to expect in terms of cabin tent stability in high wind and other severe weather circumstances?  Much appreciated.

 Asked by: Greg Malone


 
			  - 4/10/2017

 A: These canvas tents have been tested up to 40 mph though we do not recommend camping in such extreme weather. If the wind gets bad enough regardless of the tent or brand name your poles will simply bend. Replacement parts are available. It does take incredible storms to damage these tents. Nylon tents can be damaged in storms with wind gusts of 20 miles per hour. These are double that or more.

 Q: Do the cabin tents hold up as well in strong wind as the spring bar tent??
 Asked by: Rob 


 
			  - 4/8/2017

 A: One of the nice things about the cabin tent is that it holds up to wind exceptionally well. Most customers in most environments will never need to use guy ropes to help stabilize it in a rough windstorm. However, if you decide to there are plenty of places you can tie rope to give it some extra stability. It comes with guy ropes for the awnings. Replacement guy ropes can be purchased separately.

 Asked by: Kathy

 Q: amp 3 to 4 weeks of the year is that going to void the warranty?   It certainly doesn't seem like extended camping to me. According to my understanding the wall stakes are considerably lighter duty than the tent stakes and if I upgrade I have to pay for it in the first place it doesn't make any sense to me that they would be lighter I was wondering if you would upgrade the wall steaks at no charge with my purchase I'd like to be a long long term customer for  practical well run business thank yo
 Asked by: Kathy


 
			  - 4/25/2016

 A: More than three weeks is considered extended use. The tent should still hold up fine, but it is extended use and would not be covered under the warranty. The wall stakes are considerably lighter duty than those 10 stakes to protect the tent in the event of a crazy windstorm. You do not want that enclosure to tear where it attaches to the tent. It's best to let the wind (in a worst-case scenario) pull up the awning as opposed to tear the awning from the tent itself. There are some crazy windstorms. It is the same with the vestibule. It intentionally has thinks that generally allow it to be pulled out of the ground in the event of extreme wind. If you do upgrade the stakes keep that in mind.

 Q: What are the dimensions of the wall enclosure? I am trying to figure out whether this tent with the wall enclosure would fit on a 12 by 16 foot platform. Thanks.
 Asked by: Kevin


 
			  - 4/5/2016

 A: It definitely would not fit on a 12 x 16' platform since the tent is 12' x 9' and the awning is 8.5 feet giving your footprint of 12' x 17.5'. I'm sorry for the bad news.

 Q: I am concerned this tent might be too heavy for me to carry around. How many bags does it include?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: The great thing about this tent is that it has two bags.  Rather than carrying all the poles and tent body in one bag they are separate so that the average adult can manage them without any problems.  One thing I like to do is separate the awning poles into their own bag as there are times when you might set up the tent without wanting the awning up.  It is an amazing tent and will surprise and impress you with how much room is inside.

 Q: What tent is the best one for hunting for a week at a time?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A:  This tent is definitely one of our favorites for hunters and here's why. Many campers bring a lot of gear and sometimes animals when they go hunting. The deluxe awning attachment provides plenty of space for putting extra gear, animals, and equipment.   Hunters also will often go in groups for more than just one night. This tent is great if you're putting it up for a week or so as well.  The height is 7 1/2 feet inside and allows you plenty of room for.

 Q: Which tent is your best tent for tall people?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A:  Model 6133 cabin tent is definitely the best for tall people. We have other sizes to accommodate all shapes and sizes. Model 6098, for example, is just 6 feet tall but this one is 7 1/2 feet tall.   It is not only nice for tall people, but it feels very roomy for those who may not like cramped spaces.  So feel free to wake up in the morning and to stand up to stretch tall.

 Q: If I want to put an electric blanket or stereo is there a way to run an extension cord into the tent?
 Asked by: Camper

 A: Yes!  This tent actually has its own little opening that zips to accommodate an extension cord. The opening is located on the bottom left of the front of the tent. It zips closed when not in use and also zips tight when the cord is moving through it. It takes camping to another level allowing you to power electric blankets and other electronics.

 Q: Will I be able to fill a breeze with the windows closed?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Yes! You will absolutely be able to feel breeze. That is one of the huge benefits of this tent.  There are large windows on every side of the tent-and they are large. The nice thing about the windows is that it not only allows you to feel the breeze, but it allows you to enjoy the scenery around your camping area. One thing to keep in mind is that the window on the left side-a very large window-can only be opened while the awning is set up. When the awning is put down the window is closed. The awning is actually the cover to close the window itself.

 Q: Can I sleep other people underneath the awning?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Yes you can! That is one reason many people by this. Sometimes people get this particular tent because they realize sometimes they will be camping with just a few people and other times with many more. If you go camping with just a handful of people are usually able to fit the main tent room. If you need extra room simply open the awning and set it up, place down the tarp, and put up the wall enclosure and you are set. When you use the awning to sleep more people you can simply leave the tent door open (not the door, but the tent door) and it feels like one large open area.

 Q: It looks like there are two awnings included. Looks like a smaller awning also functions as the door flap.  How does that work?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: There are two awnings-one is that the deluxe awning and the other is the regular awning. It includes them both. In fact, they are both sewn on and not detachable. The larger awning and smaller on in both our optional when you set up the tent. You don't have to set them up if you don't want to. The smaller awning does also function as the door closing flap for the large door on the left side. It zips closed on the left and right sides and Velcro's on the bottom.  It is water tight.  The larger awning does not act as a closing flap for a door - it is a stand-alone awning.

 Q: Is there a way to clean off tree sap?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Yes and No.  Some trees that is very unforgiving and is not come off without a lot of work. Do not use soap on the tent. The only way to clean this is with water and a paper towel, rag, or a material that can help scrub it off without being abrasive and damaging the canvas. In most cases you can simply spray the tent with the garden hose for several minutes to get most of it off. As with any tent you may find that it does not come completely off.  It may fade over time and in some cases the cold weather will allow it to break off cleanly.

 Q: Can I set this up and leave it up all summer long?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: You definitely do not want to set this up all year were all summer. There are some businesses that will do just that knowing that they will need to replace it every year. Please keep in mind that the care instructions that come with the owners manual explained that this is not designed for extended long-term use for an entire season. It is a tent designed for fun family camping that will last a lifetime. Camping generally consists of a few weeks earlier-and overnighter here and there-or hunting trip that can last couple weeks.

 Q: Is this one of those glamorous camping tents? Glamping?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: You may be surprised to know that many organizations including Glamour camping businesses purchase this very tents. The majority of those are probably in Hawaii. They set these up for tourists to have a glamorous camping experience. They set them up on wooden bases or decks and create a canopy over the tents to prolong the life of the tent. Because you can run electricity into the tent through the outlet opening it can make it a great environment creating a nice breeze complete with electric blanket and alarm clock. If you decide to do this with your tent please keep in mind the warranty does not cover permanent or extended use. The tents last a long time, but they are not designed to be permanent living quarters.

 Q: Will this tent mold?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: This tent will definitely not mold if taken care of properly. The customers we have with mold issues almost always have one thing in common-they got rained on during camping, rolled the tent up and stored it away wet, unrolled it several weeks later only to find mold. That doesn't happen very often, but it is 100% preventable. Camping often involves rain, hail, and even snow. The tent can withstand the moisture. You should not get a drop inside the tent. However, once you get home you need to set it up or lay it out without delay to allow it to dry. It may be raining outside when you get home so you will want to find a location such as a garage or some location with an environment that is dry and will allow the tent to breathe and dry.

 Q: Are these tents fire retardant?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: The Kodiak canvas tents are not fire retardants. We urge you to be extra cautious keeping anything flammable safe distance away to keep you and your family safe. Make sure that you never set the tent up next to a campfire, cooking area, or any area where the tent could start on fire. It is not recommended to use heaters inside the tent for safety and liability purposes.

 Q: Can I put a heater inside this tent? Can I put fire wood heater in?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: This is a very common question. People want to be warm and dry when they are camping. These tents will definitely keep you dry and they keep heat in better than nylon tents, but we do not recommend heaters. The tent can withstand the cold winters of Alaska and the Arizona sun, but heaters create a danger of creating a fire. We don't want anybody to be injured or hurt. Please note that adding a wood burning stove voids the warranty and is not recommended. Modifying the tent in any way voids the warranty.

 Q: How often do I need to re-season the tent?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Kodiak tens have what's called a "dry treated" seasoning. Meaning, you don't have that old waxy feeling that gets brittle and gooey depending on the temperature. It is immersed and rolled in the water proofing liquid during the manufacturing process. Most customers will never need to retreat the tent. It all depends on how often you use it. Some customers will camp a day or two here and there while others will camp weeks at a time. Even the most avid long-term campers do not need to treat the tent often. In most cases you can get away with treating it every four or five years and that's after spraying water on it to see if there are any spots allowing water inside.  When testing it simply spray it with a garden hose using decent pressure-hit all the seams thoroughly. Should water into the tent simply find the spot, treat it with a canvas tent waterproofing spray, let it dry, spray again with water to test it out and you should be set.

 Q: What is the difference between this tent and model number 6121?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: That's a great question and very common. There are only two main differences between the two tents. Model 6121 is simply the basic version of the cabin tent. Model 6133 is the deluxe version with the massive awning. That's the difference. Model 6121 does have an awning, but it does not have a large deluxe awning. Model 6133 has the basic awning same as model 6121, but also has an additional deluxe awning (a total of two awnings). If you decide to purchase model 6121 please keep in mind that the awning cannot be purchased afterwards. The reason being, it is sewn onto the tent during the manufacturing process. So, model 6133 has that deluxe awning sewn onto it.

 A: Yes, this is definitely our largest cabin tent. There is an older model called "the grand cabin" that was larger, but it was discontinued. This cabin tent is 12 feet wide by 9 feet deep and includes an 8 foot awning that is a half feet long by 8 1/2 feet deep.

 Q: What is the difference between a cabin tent and a flex bow tent?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: There is one major difference between the cabin tent and the flex bow tent and that is the assembly time. The flex bow tents can be assembled in about five minutes, whereas the cabin tents take about 15 to 20 minutes. Both styles are fairly quick to set up. It becomes quicker each time you set it up as well. The other difference is the slope of the walls and the height of the tent. The cabin tent is the tallest with a peak of 7 1/2 feet. The walls are almost completely vertical. The cabin style is considered to be a more deluxe wave camping. However, most customers choose to go with the flex bow style because it is very quick to set up. The cabin tent can be set up by one person, but the first time you set it up you would probably want a second person there. It's difficult to explain without a video. Feel free to check out our video that shows one person assembling the tent and the awning.

 Q: Do I need to use guy ropes to secure the tent?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: You do need to use guy ropes to secure the basic awning. Guy ropes are recommended for the deluxe awning as well. One of the nice things about the cabin tent is that it holds up to wind exceptionally well. Most customers in most environments will never need to use guy ropes to help stabilize it in a rough windstorm. However, if you decide to there are plenty of places you can tie rope to give it some extra stability. It comes with guy ropes for the awnings. Replacement guy ropes can be purchased separately.

 Q: How do I wash the tent? Do I use soap?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Cleaning these tents is very simple. I'm in charge of our Boy Scout troops tend maintenance which means every time you have a camp out they bring the tents to my home, I set them up, I clean it off, and I repair any damage (somehow Boy Scouts find a way to damage about anything).  I have found that the best thing to do is simply set up the tent and spray it with a pressurized hose (not a pressurized washer). Before doing that I sweep it off with a kitchen broom to get any bird droppings, pine needles, and loose dirt off the tent. I then sprayed for about 10 minutes. I have learned that doing this can be a little bit deceiving. As your spring the tent with the hose it will look like it is doing absolutely no good. It will look like the dirt is not coming off and you are wasting time. Somehow, each time I have done this, by the time the tent is dry almost any stain or dirt spot disappears. For some reason while it is wet every bit of dirt seems to show up a little bit better. Just be patient and most of it if not all of it will be gone by the time it dries. Cleaning the interior is done the same way. Please never use soap on these tents. It can undo the waterproofing technology and damage the tent. Do not use soap on the floor either and especially do not use any type of abrasive cloth on the floor as it will take off the beautiful look. Tree sap is a little bit difficult to get off and I have found that it takes months before it starts to disappear. The stains may never come out, but they really don't look bad. It just looks like a good tent that has been on a lot of camping adventures.

 Q: How can a clean dirt from the inside of the tent? Can I use soap on the floor?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: He's never, never, never, use soap on these tents. You might be tempted to use soap especially on the floor. Soap could leak into this seems on the sides of the tent and undo the waterproofing technology. If you need to clean the floor you can simply spray it with water, let it soak for a few minutes, and then mop it up like you would a floor with an actual mop or with towels. Be sure to never use an abrasive material to scrub the floor. The floor has a subtle shine and texture that gives you a little bit of traction when you walk on it. An abrasive material would scratch that and make it look different than the rest of the floor. In most cases you can simply sweep the floor-no need to wipe it down.

 Q: Does the cabin tent have airflow vents at the top?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: The cabin tent does not have/need airflow vents. The cabin tents provide some of the best ventilation of all of our tents. There are windows on each side to provide a gentle breeze from any direction. The tents breathe very well. Generally, customers that need a little bit of airflow will simply unzip the top of the window a few inches-just enough to let airflow in and out according to your desire. The windows have two zippers so you can manipulate the shape of the opening to some degree. The models that do have airflow vents are considered flexible tents and not cabin tents.

 Q: Which ground tarp is the appropriate tarp for the tent and the appropriate tarp for the awning?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: The appropriate ground hard for the model 6133's model 0591. 0591 is a 12' x 9' ground tarp and is designed to fit the footprint of the bottom of the tent. Some customers want to put a floor down underneath the awning, however. If you decide to do that we do not carry a tarp that is a perfect match. The footprint is 8' x 8.5'. The closest heart we would have would be the 10' x 10' tarp. You would simply need to roll the edges to fit the footprint.

 Q: Do you have any tips on how to keep the inside floor clean?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: The flooring is a thick vinyl material. This type of material is easy to wipe clean with a wet rag. You can also easily sweep up dirt and other debris with a small camping broom and dust pan.

 Asked by: Camper

 Q: What is the benefit of having canvas versus nylon?
 Asked by: Camper

 A: Canvas is much heavier and more durable than nylon. Canvas tents, when taken care of, have a much longer life span.

 Q: do I need to use the tarp? What if its raining?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: A rain fly is not necessary for these tents. After seasoning the tent (wetting it down lightly with water and allowing the tent to dry completely) you do not initially need to do anything else for the tent to be water tight. Your owner's manual will also provide long term care instructions for your tent.

 Q: What kind of canvas is this tent?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: The canvas is high industry standard cotton duck canvas. The water rose off like the back of a duck. That includes Kodiak's HydraShield technology. It is a dry treated canvas so it does not get brittle in the cold or oily in the extreme heat.

 Q: How does this tent compare to spring bar?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Spring bar makes a fantastic tent. It is only second to one and that is the Kodiak brand. In an independent lab test Kodiak tested approximately 7% stronger as far as the canvas goes. Kodiak uses a heavy duty for that is almost twice the thickness and weight, and it has a welded seam. Spring bar has a thin floor and a sewn seam which can lead to water leakage. Kodiak has a superior screen that is much stronger than spring bar. Both use the same zippers, and assemble similarly.

 Q: Is this a wall tent? What is the difference?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: These are considered cabin tents. Wall tents have vertical walls like this, but they generally don't have the floor. There are many will tents that are canvas like the Kodiak models and some even include a way to heat it through a wood burning stove. These cabin tents all include floors.

 A: Some customers do use the privacy vestibule, but it is not designed for that. That is, it will not fit perfectly, but it will be a close fit. The vestibules are designed for the flex bow models and not the cabin models. They are designed specifically for models number 6011 VX, 6013, 6043, 6010, 6051, 6044, 6041, and 6014

 Q: Do most people get the wall enclosure or the screen enclosure? Which is better?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: No question about it most customers purchase the wall enclosure and not the screen enclosure. Some customers will purchase both, however, the wall enclosure has six large screened windows. In other words, it kind of acts as a screen enclosure or a wall enclosure depending on whether you keep the windows opened or closed.

 Q: Will I feel too crammed if I take my hunting buddies with me? How many people does this really hold?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: That is a great question and it is difficult to answer without mentioning some specific items. This is officially a six person tent, but if you have six people using extra large cots you are going to fill crammed. If you are going to have a lot of gear it is more like a four person tent. This particular tent is popular for hunters because there is the deluxe 8' awning where you can store gear and keep it protected from the elements if you use the wall enclosure. This tent is definitely number one when it comes to our elk hunting customers.

 Q: Were looking for a temporary shelter for the summer to use for missionary service. Will this tent work for that?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Yes and no. This tent is designed for the elements, but not necessarily extended use. Having said that we do get some customers-especially in the tropics that will live in these or rent these out for a business in extended use circumstances. To be fair, they often don't leave it out in the sun, but they will leave it underneath some other type of structure such as an awning, canopy, or even have some type of tarps hung over it to protected from extended sunshine. In those cases you can often get years of use. There is a local sporting goods store here in Utah that has had one out since the beginning of the year and it still looks beautiful. It is their display model and I think everyone is a little surprise that it has been able to last for most of one complete year. Please note that it does void the warranty if you are using it in extended use circumstances.

 Q: We have started a business for deluxe camping. Which is the best tent to give our customers the best experience?
 Asked by: Camper


 
			  - 7/16/2015

 A: Glamping (Glamour Camping) seems to be a big trend and there is even an outfit in Bear Lake Utah that seems to be doing pretty well. We have some customers in tropical climates such as Hawaii and some in colder climates such as Alaska that will use this tent to rent out to customers. It is designed to give them a deluxe camping experience with some of the luxuries and pleasures of our contemporary lifestyles. Please note that the warranty does not cover extended use. Many of these companies simply understand that they will need to replace them every couple years or sooner depending on the environment and how well shaded or protected they are.

Worth every ounce






            Posted by Unknown on 24th Jul 2017
        
First off, this is not a backpacker's tent by any means. It is a beast. I've divided mine into three bags, including one rolling duffel bag, which makes loading and unloading the tent more manageable.

But if you are car camping, especially for longer periods, just stop shopping and buy this tent. It is built like a tank and is really about the perfect size for two people and all the gear you can muster. I almost purchased the model without the awning and am very glad that I didn't do that. The awning is delightful and really adds to your available space. 

We recently had a rainy day, it would downpour about every hour and a half. I was able to drag a picnic table partially under the awning to make coffee and cook on. We had a pleasant day just sitting under the awning watching the raindrops fall. We didn't feel confined or "rained in" at all.

I was skeptical that they've solved the problem of canvas wicking water when you touch it, but they have. I tried this over and over and I could not get any water to come through the canvas even in heavy downpours. 

This tent just feels good and it makes us smile. I can give no higher recommendation for a product. Thank you Kodiak Canvas. 






Best tent I have owned






            Posted by Martin S on 3rd Jun 2017
        
Bought this tent to use on property I own in Northern New Hampshire. Set it up in May and left it up thru September. Every time I returned to my property the tent was just as I left it and everything inside was bone dry. I don't know how many thunderstorms this tent went thru but it survived them all without a single leak or problem. 




Love this tent - worth every penny






            Posted by Unknown on 29th May 2017
        
This is our 7th season using this tent and it shows very little wear; we started when the kids were 3 & 6.  We've stayed dry during storms and have plenty of space.  We now put two cots and one bunk bed cot inside, and there is still room to move around.  Often one parent (usually mom) puts up the tent on their own while the other is with the kids/setting up camp. The screen enclosure gives us extra room for gear and the dog crate.  We tie 8'x8' tarps to the awning poles to form walls during rain to extend our living space.  I cannot imagine going back to crawling into a pop-up tent.




I'm dry - others are not

This past summer I was able to stay in this tent during a family camping trip. There is always at least one afternoon and evening during our annual event that is hampered by weather. This year was no different. 

I was able to sit (or stand - I'm 5'10") and listen to the weather but not be exposed at all. Me and my gear stayed completely dry.

We had two oversize cots, bags, and clothing. There was plenty of room. 

Plenty of windows to open for the cross breeze after the weather passed. Also good for letting in the sunshine.

The only thing that I don't like about this tent is the zipper angle on the door. The zipper head doesn't take that corner very smoothly. But it's not enough of a dislike to lower my star rating.

Well made product that I look forward to using for many years!

Big shout out to Kodiak Canvas! Had a few buddies buy the Deluxe Cabin Tent and bring it on a hunting trip in Jaunuary for AZ archery deer. Had some cold crappy weather and these tents performed flawlessly! Very roomy and can fit two cots with a ton of gear comfortably! Best investment I've made recently by far! Quality and excellent customer service!

Our first trip with the Kodiak Canvas tent was last weekend near the Boundary  Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota. 
Severe thunderstorms with heavy rain and wind guts up to 80 Mph ripped through our campsite.

We not only stayed dry, but our tent didn't budge against the strong winds that knocked over hundreds of trees in a 20 mile radius


My wife and I set up the  tent and awning in 20 minutes. We used a indoor outdoor rug for flooring in the awning enclosure.

Very happy with Kodiak Canvas!








Good tent

It's pretty spacious inside and the awning is a really nice bonus. It stands up against winds really well. It's usually 10F warmer inside. I like this tent a lot.

                Product Description
            


We are happy to present the fantastic 6133 Kodiak 6133 Hydra Shield Canvas 12 X 9 Ft. 6-Person Tent w/ Deluxe Awning. Camp in comfort and also style with this premium cabin outdoor tents from Kodiak Canvas. Keep completely dry in these camping tents made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield 100 % cotton duck canvas. The tight weave as well as silicone surface makes this canvas watertight yet breathable, decreasing condensation and mugginess. Other waterproof tents will quickly come to be damp and very hot inside making them extremely uncomfortable, however not so with Kodiak Canvas Tents. Storm Flaps are on the outside and also zip up from the exterior. Go on and touch the inside wall surfaces during a rainstorm - this canvas will not wick water. The Canopy/Awning is attached onto the roofing as well as is sustained by a strong metal framework. The tough 1 inch steel tube poles with bonded edge braces will hold up to the weather. The Kodiak canvas wall outdoor tents floor is a super-duty, leak resistant, 16 oz vinyl with bonded seams that keeps water out. The high ceiling (7.5 ft at peak) and also high wall surfaces (5.5 feet at sides) give a roomy inside with stand-up, walk-around convenience. The top quality luxurious 8 x 8.5 ft. awning develops the great, best picnic location, providing shade from the sunlight as well as security from the weather condition. A big front door and also 1 side doors with sturdy # 10 zippers supply hassle-free accessibility. 6 large windows allow ample air-flow, and have no-see-um display mesh, staying out the littlest bugs. Limited lifetime warranty.

Buckeye






                First time setting it up in the backyard took about an hour with the help of my wife. We were very pleased with the overall feel and presence of the tent. The directions were clear and easy to follow. We soaked it down good with the hose to check for leaks and to shrink the fabric as recommended. The water proofing shed the water off the tent like a fresh wax on a new car.  Just spent 4 days in central Michigan fishing with 2 college buddies. We were very comfortable with plenty of room to cook under the awning and to stow gear. We sat out one down pour that lasted about 40 minutes that left 1 1/2" of water in a 5 gallon bucket with all of us and our gear high and dry. All and all this is going to be a great tent for truck camping.

                We used the tent while on a camping trip in the mountains near Santa Fe, NM.  We had 3 days of sustained winds over 35 mph with gusts over 50 mph, with just a little drizzle.  I used the optional screen for the awning.  Overall, I was very happy with the tent and would recommend it.Because of the design of the tent poles, it does take 2 adults to set the tent up (in the wind it took 4 of us).  The tent is very well made and we love the big windows.  It would be nice to have a screen on the "front" door.  The "side" door would be better if it zipped from the top.  The instructions were lacking but if you have spent time camping and setting up tents this shouldn't be a problem.  The optional screen enclosure did not have any instructions but was simple to figure out.  It was great for keeping the blowing dirt and any bugs away.  It was also a lot cooler under the awning than just being in the shade.  What I did not like about the awning is that I couldn't stake any of the front section of it down because it did not reach the ground, the front pools are not adjustable.  Because of this the 3 front poles kept moving during the high winds.  Unlike the tent stakes, the stakes for the screen enclosure are smaller and did not work that well. We did use the tie outs but it wasn't enough. I noticed that there were strings hanging from some of the seams on the front of the enclosure.  It would also be nice if there were tie backs for the screen when it is not zipped up.

                Was a very fast and easy process to get this tent! I love the tent because of the quality of it and for this price you cant beat it! You cant go wrong with this tent! Quick and easy set up! And it folds away pretty nice as well! Overall I am very impressed!

                This tent is substantial and by that I mean heavy with quality construction. Shipped fast. Let me say the box with tent and poles weighs in excess of 100 pounds. But with that said you can appreciate the build quality ... this tent is built to last and will stand up to long use in extreme conditions. This is NOT your recreational nylon family style tent. It is a portable camp that will stand the test to be sure.

                Wow! Can't say enough good things about Kodak tents or Competitive edge. Just finished a hunting trip to Mt. Hood Oregon, 5 days of rain (2 w/snow) and 50 mph wind gusts. My 6133 tent and enclosure took it all and I stayed warm and dry. Fantastic quality, super prices. I believe anything less would have sent me home on day 2. Now ordering the ground cover to complete my package.

                Received the tent and set it up. It's pretty amazing. The Quality top notch, my only issue " No Door Screen" on awning side door. the pole bag has a hole in it from shipping needs replacing. Anyone Who goes camping often should own this Tent. Everything about it is heavy duty made to last. Like the hanger loops inside. The floor is super heavy duty vinyl . The tent pegs are the best I've seen. I used to use large spike nails and still do with the other tents I own. These meet those standards and then some. The Awning is a must. The side Door/Window screen should zip down center and to the sides instead of from bottom up and out. minor details but heeding the advice of the end user in your design could make the product even better. I would pay for the up grades.

                My husband and I purchased this tent and the full wall enclosure that attaches to the deluxe awning canopy. It was easy to set up and provided enough space to comfortably sit out a rainstorm in the additional wall enclosure. The layout of the tent and all the additional wall hanging pockets helped us to organize our gear and and have plenty of space    for sleeping and storage. The only downfall about this tent is that it is very heavy, but that is to be expected with canvas.

                Cant wait to use this tent set it up in the back yard took about 1 hour complete set up .enclosure part also. hosed it down with water hose full blast did not leak anywhere.

                We reviewed many tents before purchasing the Kodiak.  The size is great but it leaked the first weekend we used it even though we seasoned it before venturing out!  Both nights we had leaks from the ceiling but none from the windows.  It was heavy as review in other reviews but for some reason both times we set it up it took four adults and a teenager to set it up.  I could see the minimum it could take would be three adults.  We were truly hoping for something for two adults.  Would I buy this again NO.  Camping should not be this much work!
            








Hunts 4 food






                Take the advice in the instructions booklet. Set the tent up prior to using it. I "seasoned" the tent by lightly spraying water on it, as instructed, and noticed it leaked in three different places and along the seam in the back of the tent. I used Kiwi Camp Dry (Silicone based) and hopefully that will fix the leaks. The rubber tips, on the tent poles that insert into the grommets, have a tendency to slip upward and sideways. I used super glue on these parts and hopefully they will stay in place. The room enclosure is a light green in color, not tan or white as expected. Spoke to Mike in customer service who told me some of the enclosures are coming out of the manufacturer with that color.

                Well worth the money.  My wife nearly had a heart attack when I said I wanted to spend $600 on a tent.  However, she knows that I only buy the best.  This purchase only reinforces that.  We purchased the 9x12 tent with awning and the optional side walls.  Very impressed with the quality of the tent, poles, pegs, and accessories.  Truly a quality product that will last a lifetime.  The only suspect item is the rubber attach points for the ends of the poles (insert into the tent grommets).  I noticed that if I wasn't careful that they would begin to pull out of the tent pole.Setup of the tent was straight forward.  Setup of the awning and optional side walls was far from clear.  I did a practice run in the backyard before we went camping.  Highly recommend that you do the same.Tent was spacious, had great head room, heavy-duty floor and with the added enclosed awning provides first class accommodations.  No regrets!  Transaction was smooth and shipping was fast.  Very pleased. (Updated on 3/17/2013.)

                finally got to put up our new Kodiak tent. It was as good as I had hoped. Materials and workmanship looks great. I have had a cheaper made canvas tent for 20 plus years and this one is far better. Should be able to put up in about 20-25 minutes next time with my wife. Did a lot of shopping and could not beat Competitive Products price and free shipping was great too. Shipping took about 1 week but Christmas  day fell right in the middle of that so I wont complain at all . Thanks for the great product and service ! Will be ordering screen room as soon as they are available and the ground cloth works just great.
            








The Hiker






                Purchased the 6133 in Summer of 2011 with the screen enclosure. We have camped in the Adirondacks and Acadia National Park  with this tent. Very comfortable and breathable. This tent is excellent. It does take 2 people to set up, but with a little practice you can easily be set up in 45 minutes. We use it for two people, with air mattresses and tables. The hanging storage caddy's are excellent for your loose items. This year we got the wall enclosure option. WOW. we have 9 x 12 and 8 x 8 - two room tent. This is an excellent option for when it rains. You can change out of wet clothing etc. without bringing them or your muddy boots in to the sleeping area. This is a great looking tent, and we get many compliments. All purchased from Competitive Edge, who are very good distributors.

                We purchased this tent with the deluxe screen room.  It took us a while to set up but we are sure it will take much less time the more we use it.Our previous nylon tent was larger, however, this tent feels much more spacious.  My husband is 65" and he can walk around standing up.We love it and cannot wait to go on our first camping trip to use it.

                My husband and I spent months searching for the perfect tent for a year plus long boon docking trip across the country. So glad we decided on this one. We have lived in it now for two weeks and the only leak issue we had was our fault (did not have the poles tight enough and water pooled).  This is a burly, solid home. I have a chronic pain condition and arthritis but have little problem setting this up with hubby. My only concern is that there is already light rust at some weld spots and the support nubs on the side poles. However, we can take care of that. Love all the windows, but be aware that the screening is a light material. We have had rains since the first and it has performed to perfection. Love sitting under the awning watching the storms.

                Ok here goes ... .   First off I would fire the guy that writes directions for Kodiak.   Second.  If you buy this tent go out and buy another 100 feet of 3/16 inch rope and some big tent stakes.  On our second attempt to keep this tent up in the flat land winds we have here with no luck. Its a little more than frustrating to say the least. I wouldn't recommend this tent without the add on enclosure.  I say that even though that's the hardest thing to keep erect on this tent.  Just gives you twice the room for another 89 bucks or whatever it is.  Checklist for things you need:  Hammer. Pliers or channel locks, step stool unless you are 65"  like me.  My brother wasn't able to reach the tops where a lot of things come together.  I would recommend having a permanent marker handy to mark the poles once its up.  We did have a pretty big thunder storm last night and we all stayed dry in the tent!  Oh yeah, to anyone that says they put this thing up by themselves or with an 8 year old the first time is full of crap.  This is a two person setup!  I'm worried how my wife is gonna be able to help me and keep out 9 month old from getting in the way.  I think there are a lot of false posts online from Kodiak people saying this thing is easy to set up, cause its not. Next to impossible in the wind too.  My tent is half knocked over right now.   I will repost maybe with better reviews once I try the extra rope I bought and stakes. Thanks

                First trip out with our new tent was an awesome experience.  The tent was easy to setup. It weathered an unexpected severe thunderstorm with 40 mpg gusts with flying colors.  A little water did get in the awning with wall enclosure and near the side door but was dried easily with a towel.  Our tent was the talk of the campground.
            








Dirty Foot






                This is one great tent. I have been looking for a tent that would be comfortable and more accommodating on long trips. This is my first canvas tent and I can say that this is far better than my old dome nylon tent. For starters, it kept me very dry during a heavy downpour on my first trip with it, no leaks at all after hours of heavy rain. With four people sleeping in it, heavy rain and all the windows up but one it was still very comfortable. Some think canvas would be hot, not so. This thing breathes well. This is a heavy tent and takes a little more to put it up so plan to give yourself a little time when you first get to your campsite. The Canopy is tricky and really needs two people to put up. The rest is doable by yourself but I would prefer to have another person. The Canopy was great with the wall enclosure to keep the bugs out, which were really bad this spring. If you put some comfortable cots in this you will have one nice set up. Once you put this up two or three times it gets a lot easier. I would recommend getting some quality stakes like the ones from Snow Peak, either the 12 or 15 inch. The stakes included are not ideal in my opinion. Also, I'm going to buy a quality canvas ground cloth, even though the floor material is very thick (I want this to be my last tent I have to purchase and I think it will be.) This is a high quality tent that I know I will have for many years, very glad I bought it. Even after its dry I spread it out in the house with the AC on + ceiling fan on low to make sure all the moisture is out of the fabric, probably going overboard doing so but want to keep any mold from having a chance to get to it.

                This item far exceeded my expectations on quality. It is fairly simple to setup and take down for a tent of this caliber. Here are the pros and cons:Pros: Excellent quality and durability; lots of windows and space with the attached awning; easy setup and takedown; excellent in windy conditions. Perfect for a family setting or people with animals.Cons: Heavy, but more durable; Wall enclosure is NOT canvass, material is like other synthetic tents. Two-person setup definitely needed for the awning part to eliminate setup time; tent and awning poles should be in separate bags.If you are looking for a heavy durable tent then you need look no further. I have been to a lot of outdoor store outlets and online. Competitive Edge has the cheapest price around for this tent or the attachment of the wall enclosure.Cheers,Canadian North

                I would have given this tent 5 stars if there were better directions. The tent is AMAZING.  Fabulous quality.  I can tell we will be using this for YEARS. There was 1 book in the box, it had very little directions. Could use better directions.  I know setting up a tent is pretty simple we got the screen section and no directions for it.

                this is a very nice tent, seems very strong, we will utilize in New Brunswick this year. Be careful though, its a bit heavy for a short-term use but not really for a week or more.

                The tent arrived within a week, along with the extra wall kit for the Awning.  After reading the instructions, I set the tent up to season it with water.  Not realizing that the weather would turn to storms two days early, I didn’t have time to let the tent dry and pack it up before it started raining.  On its first use the tent survived 1.2 inches of rain and 30 to 35 mph winds with no problems.  I checked the guy lines but didn’t have to tighten any of them after the storm.  Even the awning room stayed dry.  Only one small puddle, less than a Solo cup of water, formed on the up wind side, but was my fault for not completely sealing the Velcro to the bottom.  Over all, this is a great tent, and well made.  It is designed for multiple setup options allowing it to accommodate almost any camp site.  Not mentioned in the description is a power port on the front left side allowing easy access for hoses or electrical cords inside the tent.  It is heavy, and really needs two bags for the polls, one for the canopy polls and one for the tent polls.  But other than that, it is a great tent and I expect it to last years.  UPDATE - We took the tent on a 2 day lake outing.  The 1st day started out nice but after the sun went down the weather turned nasty.  It rained heavy for almost 3 hours.  The winds were estimated at 50 miles an hour or more.  The storm caused one of the poles to slide down on our Kodiak tent letting the side flap inward.  I went out to fully extend the pole again and add another stake to that side.  I realized that several other campers were not fairing as well since their dome tents were flattened by the wind.  The next day I found out that 4 tents were damaged beyond repair, and several others had blown over during the storm with a few even getting the contents of their tents soaked.  Our Kodiak tent held up to the storm, keeping us dry and comfortable, and all our gear protected.  (Updated on 5/29/2012.)

                This was the best price I found online for this tent with free shipping.

                This tent comes in two heavy bags, which make it easier to carry.  We went camping at Assateague and it was cold and windy with light rain.  It was solid and comfortable.  Setting it up requires two people and a small step ladder to set up/take down the tall awning/canopy.  You probably will need a pair of pliers to unstuck some sliding/telescoping poles.  We set up 3 small cots and 2 large cots.  Not much room is left for walking around with 5 cots but lots of storage room underneath the cots.  The tent could use lop or something on the ceiling to hang a lantern. It came with six cords but could use at least a few more for more solid staking.

                Hi,So first things first while I am writing my review is to state we bought this in the "OFF" camping season here in Wisconsin  for the spring-fall camping trips. We bought this tent with the wall enclosures for the awning. shipping was super fast and because we had looked at another canvas tent company we knew it was over $200 to just ship this thing. So that's great they offer free shipping.I will say these boxes are heavy, they are not light at all, they also are a weird size so tend to be kind of funky to get a hand on them. My husband was able to get them in they house after a bit of a struggle. We decided to ditch the boxes the tent and walls came in because they were wet with snow. Now the tent itself isn't that heavy, but your poles ... . That's where the weight is. We transferred the tent to the bag that came with. The poles will not fit in that bag once the tent is unrolled and rerolled. There is enough room in the bag after the tent is in there for the stakes and ground tarp. We did partially set it up in our home, we wanted to get the material off the floor that is taped in there so we did not have to pull it out later.  I will be posting an update, but since we have snow and ice here right now and freezing temps and wind chill, we will wait till April to get this outside.  (Updated on 1/26/2014.)

                Used it September 2011 in Colorado Mts great tent with side awning. Stood up to heavy rains,sleet and wind easy to put up and does take two persons to set up but one takes longer, I will buy another one later thanks great service and help from personnel at Competitive Edge.

                The tent is very nice. It took my 13 year old boy and I 45 minutes to put it up the first time. Bet I can do it in 20 minutes next time. It will take 2 to put it up but do not need a tent this big for just 1 any way. Love the front awning. It will help keep the tent clean. Tip - get the enclosure with it. Makes a good storage and eating place.

                Yes it is a nice heavy tent, but first off it comes in a nylon bag for the canvas tent, and a cheep sack for the poles. I have had the tent out 3 times and already need service, the poles will not stay erect due to a poor design. stitching seams are coming apart already as well.

                This Tent is incredible! by far the best tent I have ever owned and I have had several. This is a great improvement over the canvas tents of yesteryear that I camped in as a kid. I opted for the wall enclosure and have found it to be a great addition. I also went to Home Depot and purchased some turf carpet to put on the floor of the awning. It made it like an additional tent; my wife and I used it as our kitchen/dining room; but it could easily accommodate at least 4 more people should you require the space occasionally. I would recommend setting it up in the back yard first to familiarize yourself with it. While it says it requires two people to set it up, I set it up by myself twice; the first time it took a little over an hour but the second time only a little over a half hour including the awning and wall enclosure. Take down takes only about 10 min. and the bag they give you for the tent is plenty big enough to easily accommodate the tent so you do not have to fold it an exact way to get it to fit. Service was great, shipping was fast and best of all free! To see this tent check out my YouTube video here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p2MLgmpwwI (Updated on 9/11/2011.)

                We do a lot of camping and have owned many tents. This one is, by far, the best one yet. Quality and workmanship appear to be first class. The size was an important consideration for us as we will be camping for a month or so at a time. We like the additional space of the awning and purchased the enclosure for it as well. I was reluctant to purchase because of the weight (113 lbs). We were concerned about how we would be able to carry 113 lbs back and forth to set up. As it turned out the tent (canvas) is separate from the poles. Each has their own carrying bag.(should market that fact) Id guess the weight would be about 40 some lbs for the canvas and 70 some for the poles. One recommendation wed have is to put the poles in two bags . One for the awning poles and one for the tent poles. We separated ours that way after purchase and it is a more manageable weight.The set up is pretty straight forward. One person could set up  and take down except at a couple points you need someone to help raise or lower pole supports. Overall a great tent.

                This tent was totally awesome.  All materials were solid and of good workmanship.  During our trip, we experienced two days of torrential rain.  I was pleasantly surprised that not a single drop of water came into the tent.  One morning we woke up and there must have been 40 gallons of water pooled on the roof, but it had not even begun to seep through.  My wife and I set it up in an hour, but would have no problem setting it up in 30 minutes by myself next time.  One thing that I would prefer to see, is a floor in the screen room.  other than that, it was great.

                great tent, more head room then you would think!  I am 62" and have no problems.  just a great tent in general!

                Received it just in time for an early May 10 trip to a lake.  Weather was cool, rained two days and really hard overnight but I was dry as expected.  Not a leak anywhere.  Had big winds for two days but a few extra tie downs really stabilized the tent very well. The canopy was great to have and I cant wait to try the wall enclosure (just arrived) and screen enclosure (B/O).  It is heavy, especially the poles but its very sturdy and I expect to get decades of use from it.  One person setup is challenging (try it at home first) to say the least but it is possible.  With two, we set up the entire camp in one hour with the tent taking about 30 minutes. Very pleased; highly recommended.

                Great tent and we plan on really testing it out this summer. We are camping all summer in the Green Mountain National Forest. I have owned North face and Eureka four season tents and have been through 2 weeks of solid rain in Alaska; did well for about 10 days. I believe this tent would make it all the way. Solid Shelter, well built.

                This tent is awesome. We received it within 5 days of ordering. And, with free shipping we opted for the screen enclosure(great idea).My wife and I bought this tent with another couple as a common area for rainy and snowy camping trips. We set it up in the back yard and wet it down as suggested. It only took 1 hr 10 min. for 3 adults to set it up the first time. I think we can do it in 30 min. We have a trip planned in June to take it on its maiden voyage to Steins Mountain. So excited!!!!!!

                I bought this about 6 weeks ago. (#6133 w/ enclosed awning) I got it with in a week. I just set it up in our back yard with my 9 year old daughter. it took us about 2 hours. This was our first time setting up the tent and we were in no hurry. It rained today which I knew it would. we are seasoning the tent as directed to do. It will be dry and sunny tomorrow and we will that it down. I can see this will probable be the last tent I have to buy. an experienced camper could set this tent up alone in about 1 hr or less. I am very pleased with the tent and service I received. I would recommend this tent to any serious campers as long as you do not have to walk far with it. It is very heavy. Thank you for a great product.

                I have had the so called top of the line nylon tents in the past and had quite a few camping trips ruined because of leaks when it rained. I haven't actually camped in this tent yet, but did set it up in the yard for a week and it rained on it for 3 days. I was pleasingly surprised when I opened the door and everything was as dry as when I set it up. I also purchased the screen enclosure for some extra dry space. VERY NICE. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to stay dry and comfortable while camping. Delivery was quicker than I expected also.

                We spent a lot of time looking for a canvas tent. This is it!  We took it to the mountains of North Carolina during Thanksgiving.  Cold outside, warmer on the inside.  The 8X8.5 vestibule was nice, but I would suggest a small modification to extend the vertical lines of the optional enclosure along the tent edge in lieu of straight down.  We used a tarp to configure this and it gave us just a few inches extra that were not available with the enclosure.  This added more storage under our table and a bit more room for cooking.  The head room made it appear bigger than our 10 X 14 tent we had to replace.  Excellent choice if you want a sturdy well constructed base tent.

                I have not spent much time tent camping, but after the bug bit, I knew it was time to get a serious tent.  The Kodak is a SERIOUS TENT!  We have only used it once so far and the weather was very accommodating, but the feel  and design of the tent is good quality.  It is a bit heavy for anything but car camping, which suits us fine!  We are expecting to get many years of use from this tent.  This weekend will be our 2nd outing!  If you are in the need for a strong, sturdy, canvas tent, look no further than the Kodak!

                Just spent 3 nights in high desert south east of Tucson.  Loved the tents large size, and the awning!

                What a wonderful product.  Tested the first weekend in strong winds, rain and cold.  Excellent.  Had small heater and stayed very warm.  The enclosed awning is an excellent addition for cooking.  Service was great and quick.  Not a backpackers tent, but is a phenomenal base camp tent.  Headed out west the winter to shake it down again.

                We have used this tent couple of times now and I am completely satisfied. The whole setup from the floor to the canvas to the poles is made with high quality materials. I am confident that with the proper care this tent will last me a lifetime. I also would like to comment on the service of Competitive Edge. This was my first purchase with them so naturally I was a little leery. My worries were completely unfounded. Everything came through as they said it would. I will definitely be back.

                This is a great tent - it is well made and relatively easy to put up although it does take two people.  I wish it came in a larger size, but we purchased both the screen and enclosure to give us more room.Easy no hassle shipping
            








Utahcamper






                We bought one of these earlier this year.  We have used it many times in the rain and once in the snow even.  I was very impressed when I opened the box and saw how thick the canvas really is.  The floor is nice and the deluxe awning has been a lifesaver in the rain.  I definitely recommend this item!
