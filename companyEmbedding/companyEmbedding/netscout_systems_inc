The world leader in application and network performance management products and solutions.
What we do
Today’s corporate enterprise is a rich and complex array of applications, services, software, and hardware. Your business and reputation rely on the “Always up” availability of these systems and services. We at NETSCOUT are in the business of keeping all of those discrete pieces running in harmony and without interruption.
How we do it
We watch, listen and learn. With more than 30 years of research and innovation into network operations, NETSCOUT has developed the unique ability to capture, order, and analyze all of your network traffic in real time. While this may seem like a tall order, and it is, we feel it is the only way to provide you deep insight into the overall health and well-being of your enterprise.
Who’s using NETSCOUT?
We keep great company. NETSCOUT supports many of the leading enterprise organizations and top government agencies in the nation. Our products help them navigate today’s most vexing technology challenges such as cloud computing services, a globally outsourced workforce, distributed infrastructure, and increased mobility and collaboration. We also help service providers meet the service demands and expectations of bandwidth hungry subscribers, while supporting next-generation mobile devices and enabling new revenue-enhancing subscriber services. We would love to add you to our list of prestigious partners.
We’re always thinking ahead
Never comfortable resting on our laurels, we are busy delivering the next generation of service assurance solutions. Remember when we said we were listening? Well we are, and we’re doing it faster and with more efficiency than ever before. In 2013, we received a new patent for Adaptive Service Intelligence or ASI. This particular advancement is at the heart of our new nGeniusONE product line, which delivers a single view into the performance and health of thousands of servers, services, applications, and networks. We collect all of your network data and store it in a way that allows you to instantly understand what is going on across all of your applications. ASI does not only allow us to provide network and application performance management—it is the basis for building and discovering new insights into your operations, including security and system planning.
Lean not mean
We love working at NETSCOUT and we love helping you solve your problems more quickly and with less drama. Knowledge is power and what we do empowers. It also provides us with a wonderful place to work. In fact, we like it so much that the average tenure here is 11 years. That’s saying a lot for the tech space.
Contact us
What we do may seem to be complicated, but we work very hard to make it simple and effective. We would love the opportunity to show you how NETSCOUT can improve your uptime, bottom line, and peace of mind—all at the same time.

Network General[edit]
NETSCOUT Systems was founded in 1984 as Network General.[1] Network General developed the original network packet sniffer in 1986; it merged with McAfee Associates in 1997 to form Network Associates.[5] NetScout's also created the first Ethernet Probe in 1992.[6] In mid-2004, Network Associates sold off the Sniffer Technologies business to Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group for $275 million in cash to form Network General.[7] In early 2006, Network General acquired Fidelia Technology, adding the NetVigil Business Service Monitoring technology to their network and application performance analysis tools. In September 2007, Network General agreed to be acquired by NetScout Systems for $205 million.[8]
NETSCOUT Systems[edit]
In November 2007, NETSCOUT acquired their Sniffer, Infinistream, and Network Intelligence product lines.[5] NETSCOUT merged both product lines to allow their Performance Manager product to utilize both probes and Infinistream technologies.[9]
In April 2011 NETSCOUT acquired voice and video management company, Psytechnics, from Ipswich U.K.[10] It then acquired Fox Replay, a privately held Dutch company in 2011,[11] and later that year, after many years of partnering and complementing solutions for network switch port aggregation, NETSCOUT moved directly into competition with its partners by acquiring privately held Simena Networks.[12]
In October 2014, NETSCOUT Systems announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Communications business of science and technology company Danaher Corporation for about $2.6 billion. Upon completion of the merger, Danaher's shareholders would own nearly 59.5 percent of the combined company, and NETSCOUT shareholders would own the remaining stake.[13] Analyst firm 451 Research, a technology-industry syndicated research and data firm, predicted in May 2015 that with the acquisition, NETSCOUT will be the largest company in the network visibility management space, with "more than 3,000 employees and well over $1bn a year in revenue".[14]
In July 2015, NETSCOUT finalized its acquisition of the communications business of Danaher Corporation, including Arbor Networks (security systems), Fluke Networks (RF and Wi-Fi network troubleshooting and analytics), Tektronix Communications (traffic inspection, customer experience management and analytics) and VSS Monitoring (network packet brokers).[4] In a prepared statement, the company noted that the acquisition "accelerates NETSCOUT’s strategic progress by enabling the company to offer [...] innovative service assurance and cyber security solutions" and adds new employees to NETSCOUT.[15]

Network General[edit]
NETSCOUT Systems was founded in 1984 as Network General.[1] Network General developed the original network packet sniffer in 1986; it merged with McAfee Associates in 1997 to form Network Associates.[5] NetScout's also created the first Ethernet Probe in 1992.[6] In mid-2004, Network Associates sold off the Sniffer Technologies business to Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group for $275 million in cash to form Network General.[7] In early 2006, Network General acquired Fidelia Technology, adding the NetVigil Business Service Monitoring technology to their network and application performance analysis tools. In September 2007, Network General agreed to be acquired by NetScout Systems for $205 million.[8]
NETSCOUT Systems[edit]
In November 2007, NETSCOUT acquired their Sniffer, Infinistream, and Network Intelligence product lines.[5] NETSCOUT merged both product lines to allow their Performance Manager product to utilize both probes and Infinistream technologies.[9]
In April 2011 NETSCOUT acquired voice and video management company, Psytechnics, from Ipswich U.K.[10] It then acquired Fox Replay, a privately held Dutch company in 2011,[11] and later that year, after many years of partnering and complementing solutions for network switch port aggregation, NETSCOUT moved directly into competition with its partners by acquiring privately held Simena Networks.[12]
In October 2014, NETSCOUT Systems announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Communications business of science and technology company Danaher Corporation for about $2.6 billion. Upon completion of the merger, Danaher's shareholders would own nearly 59.5 percent of the combined company, and NETSCOUT shareholders would own the remaining stake.[13] Analyst firm 451 Research, a technology-industry syndicated research and data firm, predicted in May 2015 that with the acquisition, NETSCOUT will be the largest company in the network visibility management space, with "more than 3,000 employees and well over $1bn a year in revenue".[14]
In July 2015, NETSCOUT finalized its acquisition of the communications business of Danaher Corporation, including Arbor Networks (security systems), Fluke Networks (RF and Wi-Fi network troubleshooting and analytics), Tektronix Communications (traffic inspection, customer experience management and analytics) and VSS Monitoring (network packet brokers).[4] In a prepared statement, the company noted that the acquisition "accelerates NETSCOUT’s strategic progress by enabling the company to offer [...] innovative service assurance and cyber security solutions" and adds new employees to NETSCOUT.[15]

                IBM ViaVoice for Windows Pro USB 10.0
                            

ViaVoice 10.0's improved speech engine makes it a mandatory upgrade for current customers and the best pick for anyone new to speech recognition.

                ViaVoice Pro USB Edition 9.0
                            

ViaVoice 9.0 is awesome, if expensive, for those without a speech-recognition program. But if you're using ViaVoice 8.0, this version isn't different enough to warrant an upgrade.
