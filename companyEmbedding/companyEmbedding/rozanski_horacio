Horacio Rozanski is president and chief executive officer of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., a global firm that brings bold thinking in consulting, analytics, digital solutions, engineering, and cyber to Fortune 500 corporations, governments, and not-for-profits in a diversity of fields, from defense and health to energy and transportation.
Horacio became CEO on January 1, 2015. He is involved in all aspects of managing Booz Allen’s national and international operations and workforce, leading efforts to set the firm’s business goals and growth strategy, build value for investors, and identify emerging trends that will affect clients. 

He has played a central role in major strategic initiatives, including the 2008 separation of the firm’s core government and commercial businesses into two distinct companies, Booz Allen Hamilton’s 2010 initial public offering, and its 2011 expansion into international and commercial markets. Beginning in 2012, he led Vision 2020, which set the company’s growth strategy for the future and has allowed Booz Allen to deliver industry-leading financial results. In 2016, he led an initiative that refreshed the firm’s values and defined its purpose statement—empower people to change the world.





“Horacio is involved in all aspects of managing Booz Allen’s national and international operations and workforce, leading efforts to set the firm’s business goals and growth strategy, build value for investors, and identify emerging trends that will affect clients. ”



Horacio joined Booz Allen in 1992 as a consultant to commercial clients, where he focused on marketing and channel strategy across a range of industries. He was elected vice president in 1999, and served as chief personnel officer, chief strategy and talent officer, and president and chief operating officer before becoming CEO. He also is a member of the firm’s board of directors. 
A respected authority and leader in the consulting industry, Horacio has expertise in business strategy, technology and operations, talent and diversity, and the future of consulting. Hispanic Business Magazine named him to its list of the 2012 Most Influential Leaders in the United States.

Born and raised in Argentina, Horacio originally came to the United States to attend college. He holds a B.B.A. degree (summa cum Laude) from the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire and an M.B.A. degree with high honors from the University of Chicago. He sits on the board of directors for the Center for Talent Innovation and is a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Committee on Conscience.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                   January 5, 2014     I was born and raised in Argentina. We grew up under a military dictatorship. It was somewhat turbulent.   In 1983, the military relinquished power to the democratic government. That created a huge backlash against authority. We went from one extreme of authoritarianism to an anything-goes type of society.  Our education in some ways was shaped by that.  During the dictatorship, the way you dressed was very regimented. But when things changed, we as a society stopped studying, and we showed up when we felt like it . . .  It was not conducive for learning. It wasn’t a society that my wife and I felt particularly at ease in. That was the impetus for applying to colleges in the United States. So we wrote to a lot of schools and eventually landed at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire. Everything was different. I left Buenos Aires in January and it was 120 degrees, in the middle of a heat wave. I landed in Minneapolis and it was minus-40.  I eventually went to business school at the University of Chicago. I became a summer intern at Booz Allen, which led to a job in the Cleveland office. My wife and I moved there with an idea that I would be at Booz Allen for three years and move on to the next thing. Twenty-one years later, the rest is history.  Back when I started, if you would have told me I would have this role at the company, I would’ve told you there was something wrong with your crystal ball.  I was a commercial consultant and loved client service. I was excited about working for a client in a way that makes a real difference. I thought that was going to be my career path. My left turn came when I was asked to help rethink the people strategy for the commercial business. I was not a human relations specialist. If anything, I was a strategist and marketing specialist. But they chose me because I had a reputation for having a passion for people.  It fit my passions.  As an immigrant, I wake up every morning realizing how blessed I am to be here, make a life and work on a mission that enhances the country. Now, as president, I want to continue to build on the strengths of the firm.   — Interview with Vanessa Small   Horacio D.

Horacio Rozanski is president and chief executive officer of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., a global firm that brings bold thinking in consulting, analytics, digital solutions, engineering, and cyber to Fortune 500 corporations, governments, and not-for-profits in a diversity of fields, from defense and health to energy and transportation.
Horacio became CEO on January 1, 2015. He is involved in all aspects of managing Booz Allen’s national and international operations and workforce, leading efforts to set the firm’s business goals and growth strategy, build value for investors, and identify emerging trends that will affect clients. 

He has played a central role in major strategic initiatives, including the 2008 separation of the firm’s core government and commercial businesses into two distinct companies, Booz Allen Hamilton’s 2010 initial public offering, and its 2011 expansion into international and commercial markets. Beginning in 2012, he led Vision 2020, which set the company’s growth strategy for the future and has allowed Booz Allen to deliver industry-leading financial results. In 2016, he led an initiative that refreshed the firm’s values and defined its purpose statement—empower people to change the world.





“Horacio is involved in all aspects of managing Booz Allen’s national and international operations and workforce, leading efforts to set the firm’s business goals and growth strategy, build value for investors, and identify emerging trends that will affect clients. ”

He was elected vice president in 1999, and served as chief personnel officer, chief strategy and talent officer, and president and chief operating officer before becoming CEO. He also is a member of the firm’s board of directors. 
A respected authority and leader in the consulting industry, Horacio has expertise in business strategy, technology and operations, talent and diversity, and the future of consulting. Hispanic Business Magazine named him to its list of the 2012 Most Influential Leaders in the United States.
