Customer Questions & Answers








            If one bulb goes out does it cause a section to go out?
        

            If one bulb goes out does it cause a section to go out?
        
Asked by: Will

            No, when it comes to LED lights if one burns out the rest remain lit. They don't necessarily burn, but dim out over time.

            I put the tree together and only the bottom section is lit did i do something wrong or do you need to plug in each section.
        
Asked by: gary

            With the Quick-Set tree you only need to plug in the bottom sections. Once you remove the safety caps and stack the tree together the rest of the tree should light up. Starting with the middle section try to twist the pole a little to create a better connection. If you are still unable to get the lights to come one please call the manufacture for warranty and trouble shooting assistance.

            Is this a single plug tree or do you have to plug in each section?
        

            Is this a single plug tree or do you have to plug in each section?
        
Asked by: Cat

            You only need to plug in the base section of this tree. As you stack the sections together the rest of the tree will have power.

Couldn't wait to get the tree up only to find it was defected. it came in 4 sections and the bottom section lights were not in sync with the other swcrions. Not worth the money at all. Would not recommend. My kids were so disappointed.

Nominal Tape Widths vs Actual Widths







 Tape rolls are cut to standard tape industry metric widths of approx. 24mm per 1-inch of nominal width ordered. As a result ACTUAL tape widths are normally 5% narrower than the NOMINAL width shown in inches. Examples:


1" Nominal width = 15/16" (24mm) Actual width
2" Nominal width = 1-7/8" (48mm) Actual width
3" Nominal width = 2-13/16" (72mm) Actual width


Note that tape rolls are NOT guaranteed to be splice-free.


 Custom Tape WidthsMay be Available!


Need custom sized or "full-cut" width tapes? Many of our tapes come to our converter as full wide width "log rolls" (not pre-cut), and can be custom cut to widths not shown in the pricing table.
Contact us today for pricing and minimum requirements to order your desired tape in a custom width.
Please note that since this tape comes in "log roll" format most rolls ship on a plain white core (i.e. with no branding or text inside the core).












Product Description

Patco 5067-53 Greenhouse Tape is a UV stabilized clear polyethylene greenhouse repair patch tape. It is specially made for patching and seaming greenhouse films and is designed to be extremely durable for outdoor use. This greenhouse tape can also be used for general purpose splicing, seaming, sealing, temporary hold down and surface protection. Patco 5067-53 is resistant to ultraviolet rays and weather, it bonds strongly to greenhouse films and stands up to extended exposure to varying temperatures and the elements. The acrylic adhesive tape comes on a release liner that's easy to apply on wide width surfaces.

 Roll Sizes/Widths
Please note that tape rolls are NOT guaranteed to be splice-free. Tape rolls are typically cut to standard tape industry metric-cut sizes - or approx 5% narrower than the nominal size (i.e. 24mm per 1-inch of nominal width ordered). 
Please contact us to inquire about pricing for full-cut widths (e.g. a 6 inch roll cut to exactly 152mm instead of 144mm).

hot melt rubber (synthetic)
Offers the widest range of application flexibility available. Exhibits excellent processing performance whether manually or automatically applied. Has superior tensile strength, adhesion properties and holding force which ensures consistent, reliable seals. Hot melt adhesive will bond faster to a surface which is referred to as quick-grab or quick-stick. It typically has higher tack (will feel stickier to the touch), but is also softer. It has lower heat resistance, shear resistance, and sometimes UV resistance than an acrylic adhesive. NOTE: it is called hot melt because the adhesive is applied hot by the manufacturer and then hardens as it cools (you do not need to apply heat to the tape yourself).
natural rubber
Properties are similar to that of hot melt rubber, but natural rubber often holds where other adhesives won't (recycled fibers, dust, cold, heat and heavy loads). It provides good overall adhesion and moisture resistance.
acrylic
Offer excellent performance, especially for applications in temperatures less than 40°F and greater then 120°F. It provides excellent clarity, has high shear strength, is usually more permanent/durable even when exposed to moisture, and it ages well over extended periods in fluorescent and sunlight. Since it remains clear for the life of the application and does not yellow over time it is ideal for applications such as sealing white cartons. While it has good initial adhesion it does take 24-48 hours to cure and to achieve its maximum bond strength (has gradual adhesion buildup). Another difference between hot melt rubber and acrylic adhesive is if you fold tape over making the two adhesive sides touch the acrylic adhesive will remain attached to the carrier (e.g. paper, film) while a hot melt adhesive will stick to itself and pull off of the carrier. It is the best choice for clarity, UV resistance and aging characteristics.
silicone
Is great for extreme temperature applications since silicone adhesive can work in continuous operating temperatures from -100°F to 500°F. They also exhibit good chemical resistance, retain electrical properties, and remove cleanly with little or no residue.
zinc oxide
Zinc oxide based adhesive formula is a skin-friendly adhesive which is commonly used on sports medicine tapes.


Thickness, AKA caliper or gauge, refers to the distance from one surface of a tape backing, or adhesive, to the other.
1 mil = 1/1000 of an inch
Examples: 1/16 inch = 62.5 mils; 1/32 inch = 31.25 mils
