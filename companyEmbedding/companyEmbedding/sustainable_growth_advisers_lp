ESG

					SGA is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. Our team recognizes that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can impact a company’s financial performance, competitive positioning, brand equity and other determinants of long-term shareholder value creation. As a result, we strive to integrate ESG issues into our investment analysis and decision-making process while fulfilling our fiduciary duty to all clients. SGA’s focus on ESG is reflected in three areas of our investment process:				

Company Research






We regularly engage the management teams of businesses we consider for investment in discussions regarding corporate governance, the sustainability of their business models, management incentive arrangements and their plans for maximizing shareholder value. SGA’s investment process is focused on the long-term, and we are attracted to businesses that share a long-term perspective and are thoughtful stewards of their resources, both financial and otherwise.					    	







					    		Each company’s response to such questions from our analysts is considered as SGA evaluates management quality and whether it is sufficiently focused on generating long-term shareholder value in an appropriate manner.					    	







SGA has also engaged independent, third-party ESG research provider Sustainalytics to provide ESG analysis and rankings for all companies within our Qualified Company List to complement our own bottom–up research and analysis. These considerations are then taken into account along with our analysis of revenue predictability, global runways of growth, sustainability of earnings growth and valuation before we ultimately decide whether to invest client capital in a company stock.					    	



Engagement






					    		SGA does not take positions in companies expecting to implement activist positions, nor do we invest based on our moral or ethical opinions. We do, however, engage in detailed discussions with company managements to better understand their long-term objectives and challenges, and how ESG and other factors fit within their operating and decision-making frameworks. We are proactive in providing our thoughts to management teams regarding their business strategies, governance and reporting when needed and will decline to purchase or hold shares in a company if we determine that it fails to meet our business quality expectations.					    	







					    		Given SGA’s long-term focused approach to investing in businesses, and our unique perspective, we have found that management teams often value our views on pertinent topics as opposed to more short-term investors who are less concerned with strategic business direction and long-term wealth creation.					    	



Proxy Voting






					    		We seek to represent our clients’ interests through a thorough and responsible implementation of our proxy voting policy.					    	







					    		SGA’s proxy voting procedures are designed and implemented in a way that is expected to ensure that proxy matters are conducted in the best interest of the clients. 







					    		The policy and procedures are updated as appropriate to take into account developments in the law, best practices in the industry, and refinements deemed appropriate by SGA.					    	







					    		Material conflicts are resolved in the best interest of the clients or in accordance with specific client directives.					    	







					    		SGA’s policies and procedures incorporate a review of legislative materials, studies of corporate governance and other proxy voting issues, analyses of shareholder and management proposals and other materials helpful in studying the issues involved.					    	







We consider the litmus test of any proposal, whether it is advanced by management or by one or more shareholders, to be whether the adoption of the proposal allows the company to carry on its affairs in such a manner that the clients’ best interests will be served. Judgmental issues are reviewed by senior investment professionals to determine if adopting the proposal is in the best interest of our clients.					    	



					Accurately understanding long-term business quality is key to the success of SGA’s investment process. The way in which a management team stewards the financial and non-financial assets of a business, and the incentive and governance structure they are operating under each play a large role in determining that business quality. Our emphasis on correctly and objectively understanding these factors through subjecting each business to the scrutiny of two analysts (the primary and secondary) as well as the evaluation of our Investment Committee members and incorporating the views of ESG research provider Sustainalytics, underlines SGA’s commitment to fully understanding business quality and all its ESG and other components.

   SGA FoundedU.S. Large Cap GrowthSGA Expands TeamU.S. Focused GrowthGlobal GrowthEstancia PartnershipSGA Expands TeamEmerging Markets Growth Global Focused GrowthInternational Growth2003SGA is founded in 2003 by growth investing veterans George Fraise, Gordon Marchand and Robert Rohn. The firm is focused on creating wealth for a select group of highly sophisticated institutional clients.2003SGA manages a U.S. Large-Cap Growth portfolio focusing on high quality, long-term growth businesses with global opportunities. The portfolio is invested in SGA’s 25-30 highest conviction investment opportunities and can be accessed via a separate account, a Collective Investment Trust (CIT) or a mutual fund.2004-2006SGA expands its research capabilities and enhances its operations team. Three research principals join George, Gordon and Rob bringing strong research pedigrees and unique real world perspective to the investment process. The Qualified Company List grows to 70 - 80 companies.2007Due to client requests for a more focused portfolio, SGA’s U.S. Focused Growth portfolio was initiated utilizing the same investment approach and managed by the same team, but investing in the firm’s 10 - 15 highest conviction investment opportunities.2010As a natural extension of SGA’s existing research and focus on global growth businesses, the Global Growth portfolio was initiated using the same focus on business quality, secular growth and valuation. The portfolio is built from the same Qualified Company List and is focused on SGA’s 25 - 35 most attractive global growth businesses. It is managed by the same team. The portfolio can be accessed via a separate account, mutual fund, Collective Investment Trust (CIT) or a Dublin-based UCITS for non-US investors.2013SGA enters into a partnership agreement with Estancia Capital Management, a private equity firm led by experienced industry veterans with an operations focus. Estancia owns a non-controlling minority stake of less than 25% and retains no control over the investment process, personnel decisions, budgeting or capacity.2014In early 2014, SGA added new members to the investment, operations and client service teams. Two new research analysts along with a dedicated Chief Operating Officer and a Client Portfolio Manager joined SGA. The Qualified Company List expands to 85 - 95 companies.2014As a natural extension of SGA’s existing research, SGA initiated its Emerging Markets Growth portfolio to invest in businesses expected to benefit from the economic wealth creation taking place in emerging market countries. This portfolio utilizes the same high quality growth strategy used in each of SGA’s portfolios and invests in no more than 35 businesses.2015SGA initiated its Global Focused portfolio following requests from clients. Managed by the same team as the Global Growth portfolio, it invests in no more than 15-20 of the most attractive high quality, long-term secular growth businesses we can identify from around the globe.2015As a natural extension of the global research process, SGA initiated its International portfolio to invest in the most attractive, high quality, long-term secular growth businesses outside the U.S.. The portfolio is supported by the same team of investment professionals and utilizes the same investment philosophy and strategy as SGA’s other portfolios.


Sustainable Growth Advisers was founded in 2003 continuing the focus on growth stock investing of our portfolio managers’ predecessor firms and implementing best practices relating to infrastructure, culture, and client communications. Our growth in terms of personnel and AUM has been careful and controlled.

						One Philosophy, One Strategy, and One Team
					

						Each member of the investment team is first and foremost an analyst with primary coverage responsibilities. We assign two analysts to every company under coverage. The rest of the team acts as a third layer of research which enables us to have multiple pairs of eyes and ears trained on an issue at any time.
