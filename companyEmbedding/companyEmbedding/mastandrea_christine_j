This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Lake Erie College

                    In the context of a long liberal arts tradition, Lake Erie College provides distinctive undergraduate and graduate programs that prepare students to meet career and life challenges as educated and responsible citizens of local, national and international communities. Approved by the Board of Trustees,  April, 2007
 
About Lake Erie College

For over 155 years, Lake Erie College has been educating students for the world after college. We combine a liberal arts education with practical "real-life" experiences. We promote study abroad, offer opportunities for internships both in the U.S. and internationally and, through our curriculum, we address the needs of students who will work in a world that is increasingly interdependent. Our students learn to communicate effectively, think critically and creatively and make informed decisions. The size of the College allows students to develop leadership skills and take an active role in various student organizations and in the development of new student programs.

Lake Erie College emphasizes the individual, not the "masses." Our classes are taught by professors, not graduate students. Classes are small, allowing students and professors to know one another. We can honestly say that everyone "will know your name." Not only will the faculty and majority of the Lake Erie staff recognize you, but we care deeply about the success, development and happiness of our students.

Accreditation

Lake Erie College is accredited by the Ohio Board of Regents, the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Lake Erie College also holds accreditation from the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), and The British Horse Society (BHS) and is approved by the American Bar Association (ABA)
