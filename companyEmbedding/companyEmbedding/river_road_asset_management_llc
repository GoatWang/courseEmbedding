Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Home / Investment Strategies / Dividend All-Cap Value II

 
Dividend All-Cap Value II


Strategy Overview
River Road’s Dividend All-Cap Value II (DAV II) Strategy employs the same bottom-up, fundamentally driven investment process as the firm’s Dividend All-Cap Value Strategy.  The primary difference between these strategies, other than market capitalizations, is that the greater liquidity in the DAV II universe yields fewer target holdings.
Investment Objective
The Dividend All-Cap Value II Strategy seeks to outperform the Russell 3000 Value benchmark on a total return basis by 200 to 400 bps gross of fees annualized over a market cycle and to provide a yield of at least 150 bps in excess of the benchmark yield.
Universe
The Dividend All-Cap Value II Strategy focuses on all stocks with a minimum 2% yield and a market capitalization over $1 billion.  Companies must exhibit adequate liquidity (typically greater than $4.5 million per day average trading volume) to be considered for purchase in the Strategy.  The Portfolio primarily invests in common stock, ADRs, REITs, and MLPs, but may also invest in Income Trusts, BDC/RICs, and Convertible Preferreds.
Investment Process
The Dividend All-Cap Value II Strategy investment process proceeds through four stages:

I. Idea Generation

River Road employs two research methodologies – Systematic and Dynamic.
Systematic Research: Screening of the firm’s two principal databases — Value Line and FactSet.

Qualitative screening with Value Line: Provides a snapshot of a business and up to 15 years of relevant quantitative historical trends
Quantitative screening through FactSet: Identifies stocks that best exhibit the Strategy’s six critical criteria

 Dynamic Research: An active search for attractive candidates among:

SEC filings (10-K/Qs, 8-Ks, proxy statements, insider trading, share repurchases/dividend increases, etc.)
Industry news and research
Competitor analysis
Our Watch List (including former portfolio holdings)
Various other contacts and resources established by the Portfolio’s management team


II. Security Analysis

River Road builds portfolios in house, from the bottom up, making security-specific research central to our process.  The Dividend All-Cap Value II Strategy focuses on identifying the most attractive companies that meet the Strategy’s critical criteria:

High and growing dividend: Stable payout ratio and yield ≥ 2%
Financial strength: Free cash flow, attractive balance sheet
Priced at a discount to value: Target discount ≥ 15% of a company’s valuation
Attractive business model: Sustainable, predictable, understandable
Shareholder-oriented management: Insider ownership, accretive transactions, debt reduction, dividend initiations/raises


III. Portfolio Construction

The Portfolio targets 50 to 75 holdings, with the actual number of holdings dependent upon market conditions.  The stocks purchased are those that best meet the selection criteria and offer the greatest potential for income and capital appreciation.
The decision-making process is dynamic and team-based.  While the lead portfolio manager has controlling authority, typically decisions are made by a consensus of the portfolio managers.

IV. Sell Discipline

We believe that the key difference between a losing strategy and a winning strategy is that losers make big mistakes and winners make small mistakes.

Our sell discipline helps keep the inevitable individual mistakes from causing large, permanent losses of capital in the broader portfolio.
We do not average down on losing positions.

Small Cap Value


Strategy Overview
River Road’s Small Cap Value Strategy utilizes a fundamentally driven research process to identify attractive purchase candidates from a universe of smaller capitalization stocks. The stock selection process is complemented by a risk averse approach that employs both balanced diversification and a structured sell discipline.
Universe
The Small Cap Value Strategy targets all U.S.-listed securities with market capitalizations between $50 million and $3 billion, at time of purchase.
Investment Objective
The Small Cap Value Strategy seeks to outperform the Russell 2000 Value by 200 to 400 bps gross of fees over a market cycle.
Investment Process
The Small Cap Value Strategy investment process proceeds through four stages:

I. Idea Generation

River Road employs two research methodologies – Systematic and Dynamic.
Systematic Research: Screening of the firm’s two principal databases — Value Line and FactSet.

Qualitative screening with Value Line: Provides a snapshot of a business and up to 15 years of relevant quantitative historical trends
Quantitative screening through FactSet: Identifies stocks that best exhibit the Strategy’s five critical criteria

Dynamic Research: An active search for attractive candidates among:

SEC filings (10-K/Qs, 8-Ks, proxy statements, insider trading, share repurchases/dividend increases, etc.)
Industry news and research
Competitor analysis
Our Watch List (including former portfolio holdings)
Various other contacts and resources established by the Portfolio’s management team


II. Security Analysis

River Road builds portfolios in house, from the bottom up, making security-specific research central to our process. The Small Cap Value Strategy focuses on identifying the most attractive companies that meet the Strategy’s critical criteria:

Priced at a discount to value: Target discount ≥ 25% of a company’s valuation
Attractive business model: Sustainable, predictable, understandable, with reasonable growth prospects and high returns on equity and invested capital
Shareholder-oriented management: Insider ownership, accretive transactions, debt reduction, dividend initiations/raises
Financial strength: Free cash flow, attractive balance sheet


III. Portfolio Construction

The Portfolio targets 60 to 70 holdings, with the actual number of holdings dependent upon market conditions.  The stocks purchased are those that best meet the selection criteria and offer the greatest potential for capital appreciation.
The decision-making process is dynamic and team-based.  While the lead portfolio manager has controlling authority, typically decisions are made by a consensus of the portfolio managers.

IV. Sell Discipline

We believe that the key difference between a losing strategy and a winning strategy is that losers make big mistakes and winners make small mistakes.

Our sell discipline helps keep the inevitable individual mistakes from causing large, permanent losses of capital in the broader portfolio.
We do not average down on losing positions.
