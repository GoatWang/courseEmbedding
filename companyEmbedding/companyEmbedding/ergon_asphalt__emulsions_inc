            Jackson, MS-Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions, Inc, ( Ergon ), and Mathy Construction Co. of Onalaska, WI announced today the award of a patented process that allows for the production and placement of conventional hot mix asphalt ( HMA ) at reduced temperatures of up to 75 F. This surfactant enabled patented process which is compatible with Non-Modified, Polymer Modified and PPA containing asphalt binders was co-developed by Mathy Technology & Engineering ( MTE ) and Paragon Technical Services, Inc, and has been trademarked REVIX. REVIX will be exclusively marketed internationally by MWV Specialty Chemicals Division's Asphalt Innovations team as MWV EVOTHERM 3G. EVOTHERM 3G offers many advantages over other WMA processes including significant energy savings and environmental benefits over conventional HMA. These benefits include the ability to increase RAP and RAS content due to the reduced binder aging. It can reduce emissions of organic compounds by up to 60% at the paver screed, and provide HMA contractor's energy savings ranging from 10% to 25% without physical Hot Mix Plant modifications. EVOTHERM 3G does not alter the specified SHRP PG graded binder when added compared to other WMA technologies. Ergon and Mathy believe that EVOTHERM 3G provides workers an environmentally friendly alternative to the existing HMA and current water only WMA processes. This contractor friendly additive will aid in the expansion of the warm-mix asphalt category worldwide. We are excited to have teamed up with MWV to market this technology internationally as EVOTHERM 3G, said Baxter Burns, Executive Vice President of Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc This patented WMA additive greatly expands and diversifies our existing product portfolio, with readily apparent value to our customers and the infrastructure industry. Mathy Construction is proud to be a part of this well respected group of companies to provide a product that will help expand WMA around the country, said Steve Mathy, CEO, Mathy Construction Co. Production of high quality HMA with lower fume exposure and consuming less energy is a true win for the industry.

Chip Seal – Multiple

A multiple chip seal wearing surface involves alternate uniform applications of a rapid setting asphalt emulsion to a prepared surface, followed by uniform applications of cover aggregate. Each layer of aggregate is rolled to compaction. A double chip seal consist of two, alternate uniform applications of asphalt emulsion and cover aggregate; a triple chip seal consists of three alternate uniform applications of these materials, and so on. The all-weather surface renews aging and weathered pavements; improves skid resistance and lane demarcation; and seals and protects the pavement.

A surface treatment that consists of the application of asphalt emulsion and a large aggregate, followed by a second application of asphalt emulsion that is in turn covered with smaller aggregate and compacted. Sandwich seals are used to seal the surface and improve skid resistance, especially on asphalt pavement surfaces that are bleeding or flushing.
Combination or specialty application.

Warm Mix Cold Lay

A mixture of asphalt emulsion and mineral aggregate usually prepared in a conventional hot mix asphalt plant at a temperature less than 260°F (125°C). It is typically spread and compacted at a temperature above 200°F (95°C).
Emulsion is mixed with aggregate, and then the mix is stored or placed on the road.

e-Series


Let’s talk secure foundations. Let’s talk adhesion. eTac is a premium bond coat made with an asphalt base that is similar to the asphalt used in overlays. It’s storage stable, offers reduced tracking, and provides excellent compatibility between layers, resulting in a strong, long lasting bond. Read More »
A quick curing prime coat that protects against harsh environments while protecting the environment. ePrime is safe to apply (no VOCs) and safeguards your base from moisture during the construction phase, its most vulnerable period. With a solid foundation, your road will be better prepared to withstand the most trying of conditions. Read More »
Stand at the forefront of oxidized surfaces. eFog is a rejuvenating fog seal from EA&E that can correct more severe distresses than a conventional fog seal. It extends the life of open graded friction courses and worn chip seal surfaces by 2-3 years, allowing for 7-10 year lifecycles. Read More »
Give older pavements a more advanced life extension. eScrub is a rejuvenating chip seal that bridges the gap between pavement preservation treatments and remove and replace methods. Read More »
Make sure what’s fixed stays fixed. This new Ergon A&E product is a high-performance cold mix that’s storage stable and far more durable. ePatch protects workers by eliminating costly scheduled maintenance repairs so they can focus on other safer jobs instead of going back to fix previous repairs. Read More »
It’s a revolution in micro surfacing emulsion. Significantly tougher than conventional emulsions, the innovative, new eFlex allows roads to be more tolerant of higher temperatures and more resistant to potential snowplow damage. Its polymer ingredient is available exclusively from Ergon A&E’s labs. Read More »


Featured Treatments


Warm Mix Asphalt (Evotherm)
Warm Mix Asphalt is the latest advancement in paving technology. Compared to conventional HMA, Evotherm allows a 30-50% reduction in mixing and application temperatures and facilitates easier compaction while requiring no change to aggregate gradation or mineralogy. Greenhouse gasses produced at the plant are cut drastically, providing excellent environmental benefits. Worker safety is also improved, as fumes behind the paver and exposure to hot paving materials are greatly reduced.
Micro Surfacing/Slurry
Micro surfacing and slurry seals are cold mix systems customized to perform with varying aggregate mineralogy, climate and surfaces. Both products protect the underlying pavement from further distress and oxidative damage while restoring the driving surface. Friction resistance remains high throughout the life of the treatment. Slurry seal is used on airport runways, mall parking lots, city and residential streets as well as state and county highways. Micro surfacing has the added capability of being applied in thicker lifts. It can be used for specific rut fill situations and/or as leveling and wearing courses for city arterial routes, high ADT highways and interstate systems.
Engineered Emulsion Treatment
EET is an engineered emulsion treatment used in base stabilization or pavement reclamation projects (CIR, HIR, FDR) to upgrade the traffic-bearing capabilities of existing routes. Offering same day return to traffic as well as crack and moisture resistant flexible roadways, EET’s properties are superior to conventional cement or lime-treated bases and FDR projects.
