zForce® Technology Overview
zForce (zero Force) sensing technology is the brand name for Neonode’s product line of innovative optical sensing technologies. It provides a number of major advantages over traditional touch and proximity technologies such as capacitive, resistive, infrared or camera based solutions. With zForce technology, any type of display or surface of any shape can be touch enabled, even concave surfaces. It can also be applied to enable touch in mid-air. zForce products work with any type of touch object such as a finger, a stylus, a fingernail, a glove or a ordinary pen. It can be made waterproof and is fully functional even when submerged, compared to capacitive touch that do not work under water.
zForce technology consists of a set of light emitters and detectors, an optical light guide with lenses and a touch controller IC that is connected to a host. The host run Neonode´s proprietary embedded software stack and are connected to the touch controller(s). The touch controller IC regulates the light emitters and they send out short pulses of light just above the touch surface (or into a glass or fluid). The touch controller continuously monitor the light that is collected by the detectors and check the ambient light scene and try to calibrate the system to work in all light conditions. When a slight intensity shift of the received light occur the software try to find what has happen and initiate tracking of the object that is on the surface. The size and position of the touch object (i.e. a finger) is reported back to the host. By combining the measured value from a number of detectors, the touch position and object size are calculated. Compensations are also made for dust, wear out and other small particles on the optical surfaces as well as for variation in component quality.
With zForce technology enabled sensing displays you enjoy complete freedom of design as there is no requirement for a layered glass or plastic film that overlay the display surface. The result is a 100 per cent optical transparency window with consistent image quality and no glare combined with industry’s lowest cost.
Being light based means that zForce technology almost is immune to electrical noise and other electrical conducted interferences and strong RF sources. Our touch controller IC the NN1002, use sophisticated hardware filtering in combination with the optical and software filtering to achieve a system that is completely immune to ambient light and other strong light sources. zForce technology has a touch resolution of more than 200 DPI which enables precision writing with thin objects such as a pen or a stylus. It is developed to operate in extended temperature range, from -40°C to +85°C making it ideal for harsh environments and automotive applications such as infotainment systems and steering wheels.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Neonode started out as a company producing mobile phones, founded in Sweden by Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson. Currently Neonode Inc (NASDAQ: NEON), the parent company, focuses solely on the development, licensing and selling of the company's patented optical touch technology. The technology uses a web of light beams and was named zForce (zero force). It is used for mobile phones, tablets, e-readers and other devices featuring touch screens. The company operates in Sweden and Stockholm, with offices and retail representatives in Europe, Asia and the US.

History[edit]
Childhood friends Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson founded Neonode in 2001 with the intent of creating a brand new type of mobile phone.
The first prototype was launched at the German IT-fair CeBit in March 2002 and yielded quite a bit of attention. Around Christmas the same year, a press conference was held at Fryshuset in Stockholm. The massive attention they received resulted in 20 000 mobile phones being pre-ordered. Using their two patented technologies, zForce and Neno, Neonode AB had developed three mobile phone models: N1, N1m and N2. They all shared a similar design, featuring a large optic touch screen in color.
Neonode AB was responsible for the development and marketing of the mobile phones. The company had about 30 employees and was situated on Biblioteksgatan, close to Stureplan in Stockholm. Production of the phones took place in Malaysia.
In November 2008, the company attempted issue equity, but failed. On December 9, 2008, Neonode declared bankruptcy. The company was immediately started up again by Thomas Eriksson. The business of the parent company Neonode Inc and Neonode Technologies AB, located in Sweden, which is the R&D headquarters, has since been the licensing of the zForce technology.
In 2009, the company released an updated version of the touch-technology zForce (zero force).
In 2010 the new product concepts ClearTouch and SAT (Selected Area Touch) were introduced, both based on the update zForce version. The same year, Sony launched their e-reader based on the zForce technology.
In 2010, zForce was awarded the title "Best New Technology of the Year" by the magazine Mobil.
2010 and 2011 the company has signed some global customers in the e-reader segment. The technology has since developed and is now implemented into a variety of touch devices such as tablets and automotive appliances.

AirBar[edit]
AirBar is a computer accessory which projects light on to a laptop screen, allowing the device to recognize touch input.[4] The black bar is attached with magnets onto the bottom of a screen and plugs into a standard USB port.[5] The device is compatible with Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS.[6]
Technology[edit]
zForce: The technology is based on light fields. As the light is interrupted by fingers or objects, the system notes the position. Other objects than fingers are therefore possible to use, since the screen responds to any type of material.´
NN1001: On 03Jan12, Neonode announced a new optical touch controller NN1001, developed in cooperation with TI, that tracks any high-speed multi-touch gesture with any object (finger, gloved finger and passive pen). NN1001 connects to any microcontroller or application processor with a high-speed SPI interface.
Former products[edit]

Neonode started out as a company producing mobile phones, founded in Sweden by Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson. Currently Neonode Inc (NASDAQ: NEON), the parent company, focuses solely on the development, licensing and selling of the company's patented optical touch technology. The technology uses a web of light beams and was named zForce (zero force). It is used for mobile phones, tablets, e-readers and other devices featuring touch screens. The company operates in Sweden and Stockholm, with offices and retail representatives in Europe, Asia and the US.

History[edit]
Childhood friends Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson founded Neonode in 2001 with the intent of creating a brand new type of mobile phone.
The first prototype was launched at the German IT-fair CeBit in March 2002 and yielded quite a bit of attention. Around Christmas the same year, a press conference was held at Fryshuset in Stockholm. The massive attention they received resulted in 20 000 mobile phones being pre-ordered. Using their two patented technologies, zForce and Neno, Neonode AB had developed three mobile phone models: N1, N1m and N2. They all shared a similar design, featuring a large optic touch screen in color.
Neonode AB was responsible for the development and marketing of the mobile phones. The company had about 30 employees and was situated on Biblioteksgatan, close to Stureplan in Stockholm. Production of the phones took place in Malaysia.
In November 2008, the company attempted issue equity, but failed. On December 9, 2008, Neonode declared bankruptcy. The company was immediately started up again by Thomas Eriksson. The business of the parent company Neonode Inc and Neonode Technologies AB, located in Sweden, which is the R&D headquarters, has since been the licensing of the zForce technology.
In 2009, the company released an updated version of the touch-technology zForce (zero force).
In 2010 the new product concepts ClearTouch and SAT (Selected Area Touch) were introduced, both based on the update zForce version. The same year, Sony launched their e-reader based on the zForce technology.
In 2010, zForce was awarded the title "Best New Technology of the Year" by the magazine Mobil.
2010 and 2011 the company has signed some global customers in the e-reader segment. The technology has since developed and is now implemented into a variety of touch devices such as tablets and automotive appliances.

AirBar[edit]
AirBar is a computer accessory which projects light on to a laptop screen, allowing the device to recognize touch input.[4] The black bar is attached with magnets onto the bottom of a screen and plugs into a standard USB port.[5] The device is compatible with Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS.[6]
Technology[edit]
zForce: The technology is based on light fields. As the light is interrupted by fingers or objects, the system notes the position. Other objects than fingers are therefore possible to use, since the screen responds to any type of material.´
NN1001: On 03Jan12, Neonode announced a new optical touch controller NN1001, developed in cooperation with TI, that tracks any high-speed multi-touch gesture with any object (finger, gloved finger and passive pen). NN1001 connects to any microcontroller or application processor with a high-speed SPI interface.

(NEON) Dutch Trader Deep Value, special situations, contrarian, long onlySummaryNeonode deserves a second look.AirBar could become a game changer and help millions of PC users.Profitability right around the corner. I have been following Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) for some years now, and I just recently pulled the trigger to buy some shares in this tiny company with a market capitalization of approximately $100 million. Neonode is a Swedish company with its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. It was established in 2001 by Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson. Eriksson currently is the CEO. The company had a creative history with the development of the world's first finger-based mobile touch phone, the Neonode N1 phone. The follow-up Neonode N2 phone was released in 2007 - the year Neonode listed on the Nasdaq. At the end of 2008, the company failed to survive and declared bankruptcy. Thomas Eriksson kept his faith and established Neonode once again. The company is focused exclusively on the development, licensing and selling of its proprietary zForce technology, which is trademarked as the Neonode MultiSensing technologies. MultiSensing is an optical touch technology that uses a web of light beams. The significant advantages compared to capacitive touch solutions is the fact that it offers lower power consumption, improved speed, accuracy and clearer view. The technology is used by many different consumers and industrial electronic products such as printers, mobile phones, e-readers, home appliances, and also in car infotainment systems. What made me bullish? Despite the fact that Neonode has been despised by several contributors in the past, I think the current stock price gives speculative investors an appealing entry point to buy shares in a company that is reinventing itself. In December 2015, Neonode introduced an ingenious product that could give a boost to the company's revenues. It's called AirBar. This brings the touch screen to millions of PC and laptop users who currently don't have this feature. 

 According to the company: AirBar is a slim module that is magnetically attached at the bottom of a PC's display. When attached and plugged into the USB port the sensor is activated and starts to emit invisible light to detect the user's touch and gestures. PC users can then interact with their devices using familiar touch actions like swiping, pinching, zooming and scrolling. AirBar is a portable solution to be used at home, in the office, at school or when traveling and can be used with fingers, gloves, long fingernails and even paintbrushes. I think this is a great start to show investors that it can capture certain markets with affordable and attractive consumer products. With the AirBar, the company shows that it can invent affordable and attractive consumer products using its zForce technology. Personally, I think this could be a great success story going forward. Financials Looking at the financials doesn't give you a comfortable feeling because the company never made a profit. Revenues are increasing, so you could see that its technology is in demand. 

 Reading through the conference call transcript, the CFO mentions that the company's internal target is to be profitable this year and cash flow breakeven in the first quarter of this year. So this gives the impression that the company seems to be on the right track. Takeaway The only way to operate a rising number of devices, from home appliances, smartphones to automotive screens, is the use of a finger on a touchscreen. Neonode is a company at the forefront to capture market share in this space. The company just reinvented itself by introducing the AirBar.

					Full Description



Neonode Inc. (Neonode), formerly SBE, Inc., incorporated on September 4, 1997, develops and licenses user interfaces and optical infrared touch solutions. The Company operates through the touch technology licensing business segment. The Company's technology offers various features, including the ability to sense an object's size, depth, velocity, pressure and proximity to any type of surface. The Company licenses its multi-touch technology to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) who incorporate it into devices that they develop, manufacture and sell. In addition, the Company develops prototype products and is engaged in product engineering design discussions with numerous global OEMs and ODMs who are in the process of qualifying its touch technology for incorporation in various products.The Company offers a family of optical touch solutions under the brands MultiSensing and zForce. Its optical touch technology projects a plane of light beams in free air or over any flat touch surface. Its technology also sends light into a fluid or a glass to achieve a flush design without a bezel. An object touching the touch surface obstructs a portion of the projected light beams. This small variance of signal is detected with sensitive light sensors connected to its touch controllers that process the analog signals and produce touch object coordinates. Its solution provides sense enablement through touch and proximity sensing. Consumers experience its technology in products, such as laptop computers, all-in-one computers and standalone monitors running on Microsoft Windows and Google Chrome operating systems, printer products, global positioning systems (GPS) devices, e-readers, tablets, touch panels for automobiles, household appliances, mobile phones, wearable electronics, games and toys. In addition to traditional screens, its technology can make any surface, including water and air touch functional.The Company also offers engineering consulting services to its OEM and ODM customers. Under its licensing model, its OEM and ODM customers use single optical controller chips developed in collaboration with Texas Instruments or STMicroelectronics designed specifically for its optical touch technology. The Company's NN1001, NN1002, and NN1003 controller chips have various features, including NN1001 and NN1002 have scanning speeds of approximately 1000 hertz (Hz) (latency down to over 1 millisecond); NN1002 supports power management and enables touch detection even when the device is in sleep or off mode; NN1002 and NN1003 are synchronized to touch enabled areas by using multiple chips, and NN1002 and NN1003 support simultaneous scanning.The Company competes with Synaptics, ATMEL, Cypress, Maxim, Tyco Electronics and Touch International.

Neonode Inc. Key Developments

Neonode Inc. Announces the General Availability of AirBar for MacBook Air 13.3”, the Plug-And-Touch Solution for Mac Notebooks
Jul 18 17
Neonode Inc. announced the general availability of AirBar for MacBook Air 13.3”, the plug-and-touch solution for Mac notebooks, as well as two new sizes for Windows 10 laptops. US online retailers for the range will include: Amazon®, BestBuy, Staples, and Evine.com. In-store retailers include Fry’s® Electronics, and selected Apple Authorized Resellers nationally. AirBar for MacBook Air provides Apple® consumers with the option to turn their non-touch MacBook Air into a touchscreen device. A touchscreen MacBook is now a reality with AirBar enabling functionalities like tap-to-select, scrolling, and pinching to zoom. The product is a lightweight, brushed aluminum bar that magnetically attaches to the bezel underneath a laptop’s display and plugs in via USB. Users may plug-and-touch, or do a quick, one-time installation of multi-touch software. Neonode’s patented zForce AIR™ technology lets consumers use anything from a gloved finger to a paintbrush to interact with their laptop screens, ideal for scrolling through emails, reading e-books, zooming in on images and more. AirBar for MacBook Air 13.3” retails for $99, and AirBar for Windows 10 in the sizes 13.3”, 14” and 15.6” retails for $79. For the first time, AirBar can also be purchase in-store from 34 Fry’s Electronics locations and also from a large number of Apple Authorized Resellers across the U.S.


Neonode Mulls Strategic Alternatives
May 10 17
I want to strongly urge the Board to hire an investment banker to explore all strategic alternatives., Ronald L. Chez of Neonode Inc. (NasdaqCM:NEON), said.


Neonode Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 9 17
Neonode Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of USD 2,332,000 against USD 3,132,000 a year ago. Operating loss was USD 878,000 against USD 1,288,000 a year ago. Loss before provision for income taxes was USD 895,000 against USD 1,332,000 a year ago. Net loss attributable to the company was USD 873,000 or USD 0.02 per basic and diluted share against USD 1,367,000 or USD 0.03 per basic and diluted share a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was USD 1,605,000 against net cash provided by operating activities of USD 21,000 a year ago. Purchase of property and equipment was USD 104,000 against USD 156,000 a year ago. The decrease of 26% in total revenues for the three-month period 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 is primarily due to a decrease in engineering development fees and a onetime USD 0.3 million increase in license fees in the first quarter 2016 related to a catch-up of license fees from HP.

Some people prefer the look of desktop PCs, which also allow them to have access to larger hard drive, large-screen monitors and faster processors. Whether you need to buy a completely new computing system, a new PC tower only or just some new peripherals, we have what you need at our Every Day Low Prices. Types of desktop computers Desktop computers are available in two forms: personal computers and Macintosh computers. Macintosh computers are made by Apple and run on a different type of operating system than personal computers. They also have different processors, interfaces and compatibility. When choosing desktop computers, factors to consider include brand; the amount of random access memory (RAM) that's available, which ranges from between less than 3 gigabytes to more than 12GB; processor brand; processor speed, which ranges from 1.5 gigahertz and less to more than 3GHz; hard drive sizes, which range from less than 100GB to 2 terabytes and higher; and operating system type. Desktop PCs are available in brand new condition or refurbished condition. There are a variety of desktop computer styles available: Full-size desktop computers feature a standalone hard drive that's in its own case, plus monitor, mouse and keyboard. Compact desktop computers, also known as slim computers, have a smaller, thinner version of a full-size desktop computer case. However, all the components are the same size. all-in-one desktop computers have the monitor and hard drive combined into one; most Macintosh desktop computers are this style. Gaming desktop computers are best suited for computer gaming and tend to be more powerful in terms of processor speed and graphics card; these also have a great deal more RAM, too. Desktop computer monitors Except for all-in-one desktop computers, it's necessary to purchase a monitor when selecting a replacement hard drive. Choosing a monitor is based on brand, type of monitor and screen size. The different types of monitors available include liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors, which can either be passive matrix or active matrix types and use backlighting; light-emitting diode (LED) and organic LED (OLED) monitors, which aren't backlit; in-plane switching (IPS) monitors, are thin film translator LCD monitors that provide enhanced color and deeper black reproduction; and 4K ultra-high-definition (UHD) monitors have four times the pixels of a standard 1080p monitor, and produce sharper screen imaging. Most monitors are flat-screen or flat-panel monitors, but there are curved monitors, too. Monitors are sold based on connector type, which is either video graphics array (VGA), digital visual interface (DVI) or universal serial bus (USB); resolution, such as 1080p or 4K UHD; and screen size, which is measured like a television from one lower corner to the opposite upper corner and range in size from 19 inches and smaller to 26 inches and larger. Desktop computer accessories The most important computer accessories are the keyboard and mouse. Often these are sold together as part of a package. Both keyboards and mice are available in corded and cordless varieties and connect to a desktop computer via one of its USB ports. Most keyboards are rectangular and are standard QWERTY keyboards. Some keyboards are ergonomically shaped and have places for your wrist to rest while typing. Most keyboards have a standard number of keys while a gaming keyboard will have additional keys that are programmable for in-game use. Some keyboards have backlighting to allow you to use them in low-light situations. Most computer mice come in the same general shape, one that has been deemed to be most comfortable for the hand. These can be operated with either hand and usually have two buttons and a track wheel. Some gaming mice have three or more buttons that are programmable for gaming use, and some are more ergonomically shaped. Other desktop computer accessories to consider include:  A wrist rest, which help relieve pressure on your wrist (some keyboards include them). A mouse pad that ensures your mouse tracks properly. Joystick or driving wheel types of mice are suitable for several types of computer games. Surge protectors prevent electrical surges from damaging your computer equipment.computer speakers and subwoofers enhance the sounds coming from your computer and are ideal for watching videos, movies, TV shows and playing video games.Headphones are needed for when you wish to keep the sounds of your computer from interfering with those around you, or you wish to hear more details.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863236, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

There are many options available when it comes to laptops, and you can choose the screen size, operating system, processor and hard drive size to customize your device to meet your needs. Laptops are available at our Every Day Low Prices, so no matter which one you choose, you can count on saving money on your purchase.Laptop typesWhen deciding to purchase a laptop, consider what type of laptop you need and whether you want a brand new one or a refurbished one. One initial consideration is screen size, which typically ranges between 11 inches and 18 inches. There are several types available; decide which platform you want, then style of laptop.Apple laptops   Apple laptops, known as MacBooks, operate the same way the PC laptops work. Some of the amenities may be slightly different, but the major difference is the operating system. PC laptops typically run on Windows operating systems while MacBooks use Apple's proprietary operating systems. The screen size, hard drive space, processor speed and other selling points are virtually similar to PC laptops   it just comes down to the look and functionality of the operating system you prefer.Two-in-one laptops   These devices can either work as a laptop on one mode or as a tablet when the screen is detached from the keyboard or bent back 360 degrees in the other mode. If you want your device to be a laptop first and tablet second, choose the kind that turns 360 degrees; if a tablet is your primary focus, then choose a detachable touchscreen device.Touchscreen laptops   You don t have to have your laptop become a tablet to use touchscreen capability; there are laptops that feature built-in touchscreens. These work with a keyboard as well, so you have either option at your disposal.Ultrabooks   These are lightweight laptops on the entry-level end of laptop computing. They usually have limited battery life and storage space but otherwise operate like other laptops. They sometimes lack extra features like disc drives.gaming laptops   Gaming laptops are powerful laptops that have a great deal of random-access memory, larger storage drives, faster processors and more powerful graphics cards, making them suitable for high-end computing needs, such as the processing speeds you need when you're playing video games.Laptop accessoriesTo enjoy all of the benefits your laptop has to offer, there are some accessories to consider adding to it as well.hard drives, storage and usb flash drives   If you're not in the market for a new laptop but want to increase your hard drive or storage space, buying a replacement laptop hard drive is a solution. These can increase your hard drive space by 500GB to as much as 6TB. Make sure that the replacement hard drive is compatible with your device and have it professionally installed if necessary. Another option is to choose a portable hard drive, which connects to your laptop via a USB port and allows you to store up to 16TB of data, whether that's movies, photos or music.Batteries and A/C adapters   Anyone who's worked with a laptop computer knows that the batteries don't always have much juice in them, especially as they age. Having a secondary or backup battery makes it possible to keep working without having to plug your laptop into an electrical socket. You can also increase your battery power with a larger battery. A/C adapters allow you to both power your computer and recharge your battery at the same time. Buy an adapter suitable for your brand and model of laptop.Audio and video components   Although laptop computers have built-in speakers, headphones typically provide higher-quality sound. However, if you prefer, there are computer speakers that you can connect to your laptop and improve the sound it delivers immensely. These are smaller than even PC audio speakers and connect through your laptop's USB ports. If your laptop doesn't have a built-in webcam, you can add one that you can attach to the top of your laptop's screen.Cases and bags   Protect your laptop when it's not in use with a laptop bag, sleeve or case. These are designed to shield your laptop from harm from moisture and damage from falls. Some have slim profiles, while others have room for accessories like extra batteries, speakers and power cords.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863239, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863242, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Even if you don t use them for business   maybe you have a large family   you may have several computers that need Internet access at the same time. To do this, you can incorporate several devices that make computing in your home or business much easier, faster and more efficient. We have low prices, every day, on everything, so you can build the ideal network for your needs and save some money at the same time. Check out some of the essential components that'll keep your network running smoothly.RoutersRouters allow several different computers to connect to an existing network. Although some routers still exist that require you to physically attach your computers to them, many of the updated models available today can connect to your computer wirelessly. This allows other devices, such as smartphones, tablets and Smart TVs, to also connect to the router via Wi-Fi. Note that, for the modem to let you access the Internet, you need to establish an outside connection to an Internet provider and then connected it to the modem, which you then connect to the router to create an Internet protocol address. Otherwise, the network only connects to the other devices that you connect to it to enable file sharing. There are certain key factors to know when selecting what router to purchase:Radio bandwidth   Although some routers feature a single bandwidth, most are dual-band routers that let you connect to the Internet via one of two radio frequencies   2.4GHz and 5GHz. This allows your router users to be on different bands in the same home or business. It also facilitates faster speeds for whatever you're doing on the Web, such as downloading files or watching videos.Coverage   This determines how strong the signal that the router puts out is, and it can mean that users on the outer edge of the coverage area may experience drops or lag in what they're doing.Ports   The types of ports available, such as Ethernet ports, determine what you can connect to the router. Routers with Ethernet ports allow faster file-transfer rates. Those with USB ports let you connect other devices to the router, such as a scanner or printer.ModemsModems let routers or computers connect directly to the Internet via an outside source, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) Internet service or cable Internet service. Cable connections occur with a coaxial cable connection; they're similar to what's used when connecting a television to a cable service box. DSL connections are made using a telephone connection, which is sometimes referred to as an RJ-11 connection, that runs to a telephone socket on a wall. Although very rare, dial-up modems are also still in production and use ordinary phone lines to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP). When choosing a modem, the key factors you want to look for include compatibility with your computer's or other device's operating system, such as Windows or iOS; the upload and download speeds it provides; security protection, such as WEP encryption and WPA/WPA2 security protocol; size of the modem and the cost of the modem.Signal boosters and devicesFor those who have older technology in their modems or routers, there are options to ensure better Wi-Fi reception in your home or place of business. You could move the router to a more central location, but that might not be feasible. A signal booster, also known as a Wi-Fi repeater, makes it possible to amplify the signal your router produces. For example, if the modem you use to connect your network to your ISP is in your garage or in an outlying office in your business, you can place a signal booster in the center of your location, which will repeat the same level of signal it receives to the other areas of your location. This can as much as double your router's coverage area.If the router you're using is current and in the best spot to receive its signal but your coverage is still weak, then a Wi-Fi extender can solve your issues. Wi-Fi extenders allow you to send the router's signal through the electrical circuitry in your business or home. You then connect an adapter to an electrical outlet near where your router is and add a second adapter to an electrical outlet where you need the signal to improve. You can also do this with an Ethernet cable when connecting to an Ethernet device, such as a video game console or smart TV. You can even create a secondary Wi-Fi network in this manner. Look for Wi-Fi repeaters or extenders based on the coverage area in square feet to determine which one is right for your needs.Other networking itemsThere are other devices you can use when setting up your own network:USB wireless network adapters   These small devices plug into your desktop or laptop computer and let you connect to a network wirelessly.Network-attached storage   If you have limited storage space on your computer and don't want to store your documents, photos, videos, MP3s or other files in an online cloud, you can use a network-attached storage device, also called a portable hard drive, that's connected to your router. That way, you can share what you've saved to the storage device with anyone connected to your network. These range in size from 250GB or less to 2TB or more.Access points   An access point is either a standalone device or integrated technology in a router that allows Wi-Fi-capable devices to connect to a wired network.Ethernet switches   Ideal for businesses, an Ethernet switch makes it possible connect several computers, servers, IP cameras and other devices to your local area network.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863632, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Neonode started out as a company producing mobile phones, founded in Sweden by Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson. Currently Neonode Inc (NASDAQ: NEON), the parent company, focuses solely on the development, licensing and selling of the company's patented optical touch technology. The technology uses a web of light beams and was named zForce (zero force). It is used for mobile phones, tablets, e-readers and other devices featuring touch screens. The company operates in Sweden and Stockholm, with offices and retail representatives in Europe, Asia and the US.

History[edit]
Childhood friends Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson founded Neonode in 2001 with the intent of creating a brand new type of mobile phone.
The first prototype was launched at the German IT-fair CeBit in March 2002 and yielded quite a bit of attention. Around Christmas the same year, a press conference was held at Fryshuset in Stockholm. The massive attention they received resulted in 20 000 mobile phones being pre-ordered. Using their two patented technologies, zForce and Neno, Neonode AB had developed three mobile phone models: N1, N1m and N2. They all shared a similar design, featuring a large optic touch screen in color.
Neonode AB was responsible for the development and marketing of the mobile phones. The company had about 30 employees and was situated on Biblioteksgatan, close to Stureplan in Stockholm. Production of the phones took place in Malaysia.
In November 2008, the company attempted issue equity, but failed. On December 9, 2008, Neonode declared bankruptcy. The company was immediately started up again by Thomas Eriksson. The business of the parent company Neonode Inc and Neonode Technologies AB, located in Sweden, which is the R&D headquarters, has since been the licensing of the zForce technology.
In 2009, the company released an updated version of the touch-technology zForce (zero force).
In 2010 the new product concepts ClearTouch and SAT (Selected Area Touch) were introduced, both based on the update zForce version. The same year, Sony launched their e-reader based on the zForce technology.
In 2010, zForce was awarded the title "Best New Technology of the Year" by the magazine Mobil.
2010 and 2011 the company has signed some global customers in the e-reader segment. The technology has since developed and is now implemented into a variety of touch devices such as tablets and automotive appliances.

AirBar[edit]
AirBar is a computer accessory which projects light on to a laptop screen, allowing the device to recognize touch input.[4] The black bar is attached with magnets onto the bottom of a screen and plugs into a standard USB port.[5] The device is compatible with Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS.[6]
Technology[edit]
zForce: The technology is based on light fields. As the light is interrupted by fingers or objects, the system notes the position. Other objects than fingers are therefore possible to use, since the screen responds to any type of material.´
NN1001: On 03Jan12, Neonode announced a new optical touch controller NN1001, developed in cooperation with TI, that tracks any high-speed multi-touch gesture with any object (finger, gloved finger and passive pen). NN1001 connects to any microcontroller or application processor with a high-speed SPI interface.
Former products[edit]
Neno Neno was Neonodes custom graphical user interface (GUI) controlling the Microsoft Windows CE operating system. Neonode devices ran Neno from a removable Secure Digital card.

Childhood friends Magnus Goertz and Thomas Eriksson founded Neonode in 2001 with the intent of creating a brand new type of mobile phone.
The first prototype was launched at the German IT-fair CeBit in March 2002 and yielded quite a bit of attention. Around Christmas the same year, a press conference was held at Fryshuset in Stockholm. The massive attention they received resulted in 20 000 mobile phones being pre-ordered. Using their two patented technologies, zForce and Neno, Neonode AB had developed three mobile phone models: N1, N1m and N2. They all shared a similar design, featuring a large optic touch screen in color.
Neonode AB was responsible for the development and marketing of the mobile phones. The company had about 30 employees and was situated on Biblioteksgatan, close to Stureplan in Stockholm. Production of the phones took place in Malaysia.

The business of the parent company Neonode Inc and Neonode Technologies AB, located in Sweden, which is the R&D headquarters, has since been the licensing of the zForce technology.
In 2009, the company released an updated version of the touch-technology zForce (zero force).
In 2010 the new product concepts ClearTouch and SAT (Selected Area Touch) were introduced, both based on the update zForce version. The same year, Sony launched their e-reader based on the zForce technology.
In 2010, zForce was awarded the title "Best New Technology of the Year" by the magazine Mobil.
2010 and 2011 the company has signed some global customers in the e-reader segment. The technology has since developed and is now implemented into a variety of touch devices such as tablets and automotive appliances.

AirBar[edit]
AirBar is a computer accessory which projects light on to a laptop screen, allowing the device to recognize touch input.[4] The black bar is attached with magnets onto the bottom of a screen and plugs into a standard USB port.[5] The device is compatible with Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS.[6]
Technology[edit]
zForce: The technology is based on light fields. As the light is interrupted by fingers or objects, the system notes the position. Other objects than fingers are therefore possible to use, since the screen responds to any type of material.´
NN1001: On 03Jan12, Neonode announced a new optical touch controller NN1001, developed in cooperation with TI, that tracks any high-speed multi-touch gesture with any object (finger, gloved finger and passive pen). NN1001 connects to any microcontroller or application processor with a high-speed SPI interface.
Former products[edit]
Neno Neno was Neonodes custom graphical user interface (GUI) controlling the Microsoft Windows CE operating system. Neonode devices ran Neno from a removable Secure Digital card.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
