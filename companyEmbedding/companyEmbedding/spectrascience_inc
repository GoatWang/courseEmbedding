http://www.spectrascience.com/index.php
SpectraScience, Inc. (SCIE: OTCQB) is medical device company focused on diagnosing colorectal cancer early using physical properties of light to diagnose cancer. SNNLive met with Michael Oliver, President and CEO of SpectraScience at the LHA BioTech Week 2012 in San Francisco, CA. SpectraScience laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy technology has lead to the company’s product, The WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System.
This device is based upon technology that detects the native fluorescence of tissue. Fluorescence occurs when various molecular components present in tissue are “excited” at certain wavelengths of light and re-emit energy in a distinct and measurable way. This re-emitted energy is referred to as the spectral signature. Healthy tissue generates a spectral signature that is measurably different from tissue that is not normal, such as cancerous and pre-cancerous tissue. LIF targets these chemical properties of tissue: amino acids, enzymes, and structural proteins.
With this technology, Mr. Oliver claims, their device can diagnose cancer in, “approximately one second.” As Mr. Oliver tells our host, “we shipped first products to our distributors in Europe for sale in France and Europe. We are looking forward to 2012 for being our first year of real revenue for SpectraScience.” For more information about SpectraScience, check out their website. SNNLive welcomes Michael Oliver, President and CEO of SpectraScience, Inc.

Spectra Science - Innovations In Cancer Detection  SCIE Will Begin meeting with the FDA towards the preparation and submission of a Supplemental PMA filing with the FDA and plan for additional clinical trials to support eventual approval for sale in the United States !!        Lighting the way to improve your practice. The proprietary WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System assists the practicing gastroenterologist who uses a flexible endoscope to find polyps that may be cancerous. The capability to distinguish if the tissue is cancerous or not is made immediately, and complements your expertise. The physician uses laser-induced fluorescence and an optical fiber to transmit laser light via the flexible endoscope to the tissue. The auto-fluorescence from the tissue is then collected and returned to an optical detector for analysis. The result is then available with no waiting days for a pathology report. Simply stated, we work with you to create better outcomes for your patients.   Our value proposition is simple We improve a doctor's ability to diagnose cancer and we lower the cost of diagnosis. SpectraScience offers a simplified yet highly effective way of diagnosing colorectal cancer early, when recovery rates are high. Our WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System® uses light to diagnose tissue health. In fact, our patented technology instantly detects if tissue is normal, pre-cancerous or cancerous without the need for a costly physical biopsy. According to the American Cancer Society, over 140,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are expected in the US this year alone. This dreaded disease is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US (after lung cancer), and the third most common cancer overall. Only 39% of colorectal cancers are detected at an early stage.    Products  Our proprietary WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System is used as an adjunct to the gastroenterologist in normal practice and is compatible with existing endoscopes. The WavSTAT uses Laser Induced Fluorescence and an optical fiber forceps to transmit laser light via endoscope to the tissue. Auto-fluorescence back from the interrogated tissue is collected and returned to an optical detector for analysis and a definitive diagnostic rendered. The WavSTAT provides a binary, "Suspect" or "Non-Suspect" diagnostic output which, unlike traditional image-based systems, requires no analysis or interpretation.   Technology           Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIF) The WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System is presently based upon technology that detects the native fluorescence of tissue. Fluorescence occurs when various molecular components present in tissue are “excited” at certain wavelengths of light and re-emit energy in a distinct and measurable way. This re-emitted energy is referred to as the spectral signature. Healthy tissue generates a spectral signature that is measurably different from tissue that is not normal, such as cancerous and pre-cancerous tissue. LIF targets these chemical properties of tissue: amino acids, enzymes, and structural proteins. Scattering Spectroscopy (SS) This IP-protected technology is a novel optical scientific method that will complement our LIF technology in future WavSTAT Systems. It can be used in combination with LIF or stand-alone for diagnosis. SS targets physical properties of tissue: vascularity, epithelial thickness and cell nuclei. SS employs a wavelength-dependent component of light scattered by epithelial cells to obtain information about subcellular structures, such as cell nuclei. Since nuclear atypia is one of the hallmarks of precancerous and cancerous changes in most human tissues, the technique has the potential to provide a broadly applicable means of detecting epithelial precancerous lesions and noninvasive cancers in various organs*. These can be optically accessed either directly or by means of optical fibers. Therefore, SS facilitates the ability to scan the tissue and detect, not merely diagnose, possible cancerous lesions. *Citable URI: http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/29892 Multi Modal In the future, we envision a combination of LIF and SS will provide a blend of light-based diagnoses for optimal clinical results across many different kinds of cancer. We believe that this “multi-modal” future will allow us to pursue many detection and diagnosis markets, with an increased number of possible strat     The WavSTAT mobile console is the heart of the system and is comprised of a low-power laser, a sophisticated light detector, an internal computer and analysis software. The console incorporates a touch screen for input and output as well as the capability of interfacing with additional screens providing, for example, an image which can be included on a typical endoscope monitor. The key to the diagnostic process is our proprietary waveform analysis algorithm. used today to diagnose colon cancer and precancerous tissue.   SpectraScience, Inc   Most Recent Financials DownloadViewX    Filed Date Form Type Description View     05/22/2017 Form 10-Q Quarterly report      05/15/2017 Form NT 10-Q Notification of inability to timely Form 10-Q                                                                                                              Partial List of Company Owned PATENTS: Referenced by    Citing Patent Filing date Publication date Applicant Title     WO1999045838A1 * Mar 9, 1999 Sep 16, 1999 Spectrascience, Inc.

	Our value proposition
	is simple

	We improve a doctor's ability to diagnose cancer
	and we lower the cost of diagnosis.

	SpectraScience offers a simplified yet highly effective way of diagnosing colorectal cancer early, when recovery rates are high. Our WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System® uses light to diagnose tissue health. In fact, our patented technology instantly detects if tissue is normal, pre-cancerous or cancerous without the need for a costly physical biopsy.

	According to the American Cancer Society, over 140,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are expected in the US this year alone. This dreaded disease is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US (after lung cancer), and the third most common cancer overall. Only 39% of colorectal cancers are detected at an early stage.






	Lighting the way to improve
	your practice.

	 

	The proprietary WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System assists the practicing gastroenterologist who uses a flexible endoscope to find polyps that may be cancerous. The capability to distinguish if the tissue is cancerous or not is made immediately, and complements your expertise. The physician uses laser-induced fluorescence and an optical fiber to transmit laser light via the flexible endoscope to the tissue. The auto-fluorescence from the tissue is then collected and returned to an optical detector for analysis. The result is then available with no waiting days for a pathology report.

	Simply stated, we work with you to create better outcomes for your patients.





 
	Lighting the way for more
	than just colorectal cancer.

	 

	SpectraScience will continue to expand its business in the coming years with future applications and light-based technologies employed on our WavSTAT platform. Our near-term target indications include esophageal cancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer. We also continue discussions with multiple potential partners to explore opportunities in other types of cancer diagnosis.

	Our goal is to offer a choice of the best optical technologies for optimal, definitive clinical detection and diagnosis.

	Business - What we do

	The problem: Costly and Inaccurate Diagnosis of Colon Cancer

	According to the American Cancer Society, only 39% of colorectal cancers are detected at an early stage, which is the optimum time for cure. Clinical studies indicate that effective screening procedures using the WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System can significantly improve conventional diagnosis during colonoscopy.

	As demographics shift, and the population ages, the incidence of colorectal cancer is expected to increase substantially. In addition, pressure to reduce the overall cost of healthcare is accelerating. Statistics, therefore, point to increased use of the WavSTAT Optical Biopsy System to aid physicians' diagnoses and save patients' lives.

	Current diagnostic methods include techniques that rely upon subjective analysis and human interpretation during colonoscopy, including:
	Visual assessment using high-definition video Enhanced imaging interpretation with various techniques that require training and specialized expertise
	Preliminary clinical data suggest that WavSTAT technology improves the ability of gastroenterologists to diagnose colon cancer by as much as 40% and can reduce the False Negative rate by up to 93%.
