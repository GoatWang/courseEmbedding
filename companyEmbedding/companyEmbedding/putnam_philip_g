Overview

For more than two decades, G.P. Putnam’s Sons has led the publishing industry with more hardcover New York Times bestsellers than any other imprint. With its rich history of publishing established franchises and new talent, as well as award winners, with an unrivaled bestselling track record, Putnam continues to be one of the most respected and prestigious imprints in the industry.
Among the distinguished roster of bestselling fiction authors Putnam publishes are: Dave Barry, Alex Berenson, C.J. Box, Eleanor Brown, Tom Clancy, Robin Cook, Robert Crais, Clive Cussler, Frederick Forsyth, Sue Grafton, William Gibson, W.E.B. Griffin, Jack Higgins, Philip Kerr, Liane Moriarty, Robert B. Parker, Jan Karon, Ridley Pearson, John Sandford, Kathryn Stockett, Randy Wayne White, and Stuart Woods. In nonfiction, authors published by the imprint include Sophia Amoruso, Secretary of State James Baker, Thomas Barnett, A. Scott Berg, Maureen Dowd, Goldie Hawn, T.D. Jakes, Spencer Johnson, Bobby Orr, Dolly Parton, and Burt Reynolds.
History of Putnam
In 1838 George Palmer Putnam, who began his career at a small New York bookstore, moved to London to establish the first American publishing branch of Wiley and Putnam in England. Ten years later, Putnam returned to the United States and the company became known as “George P. Putnam.” In 1849, Putnam published the revised works of his close friend, American author and historian Washington Irving. One year later, the house published Susan Warner’s The Wide, Wide World, which became known as America’s first bestseller, selling forty thousand copies in the first few months, and eventually more than one million over its life. Over the next century and a half, Putnam published works by President Theodore Roosevelt (who worked for a year at the house before turning to politics), William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, Norman Mailer’s Deer Park, Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita, and Mario Puzo’s The Godfather.
In 2013 G.P. Putnam’s Sons celebrated its 175th year of publishing, culminating in an official “G.P. Putnam’s Sons Day” declared by the New York City mayor’s office on May 28, 2013. The history of Putnam is nearly as long as that of our country – and also as varied.  The world is very different than it was in 1838, and the imprint is too, though many core values live on – an attendance to quality, honoring our authors, service to our readers, and of course a yen to create bestsellers. Putnam continues to hold industry dominance with an average of 30 to 35 New York Times bestsellers per year, applying aggressive marketing and sales acumen as it publishes established brands and new discoveries.

Her award-winning poets have included Cornelius Eady, Karl Kirschwey, and the MacArthur Foundation Fellow Linda Bierds.

Fund description
 The subaccount employs Putnam's value strategy to invest primarily in stocks of large and mid-sized companies that are undervalued and poised for positive change. The subaccount favors dividend-paying companies and is broadly diversified across market sectors. To help manage volatility and increase current income, up to 20% of the portfolio can be invested in high quality, fixed-income securities.



Sales story
 Seeking to harness the power of stock dividends Dividend-paying companies: Dividends offer evidence of a company's commitment to creating shareholder value and are typically paid by more established companies.A large-value focus: The fund focuses on large companies whose stocks are priced below their long-term potential, and where there may be a catalyst for positive change.A rigorous process: The fund's experienced manager combines quantitative research with rigorous fundamental investment research to find opportunities and manage risk.

Mutual funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk. Capital gains, if any, are taxable for federal and, in most cases, state purposes. For some investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income from federally exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.Although value investing targets stocks believed to be priced too low, there is no guarantee they will appreciate.

Unit values and performance information shown apply to the specific annuity product listed, not the underlying Putnam Variable Trust fund. This information should not be used by investors who hold an interest in Putnam Variable Trust funds through a different annuity or other variable product. The unit values and performance of other variable products that offer Putnam Variable Trust funds may be higher or lower due to product charges and expenses or other factors.


Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. More recent returns may be less or more than those shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your units.


Returns shown for the subaccounts for periods before their inception are derived from the historical performance of the underlying fund, adjusted to reflect the mortality, expense risk, and surrender charges applicable to this product and do not factor in the annual $30 contract maintenance fee. Additional riders and options for insurance-related charges will increase expenses and lower returns. Please see the prospectus for details. For a portion of the period, subaccounts may have limited expenses, without which returns would have been lower.


Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Putnam Hartford products are flexible-premium variable annuities issued by Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Simsbury, CT.


Putnam Allstate variable annuities are flexible-premium deferred variable annuities issued by Allstate Life Insurance Company (Allstate Life); underwritten by Allstate Distributors, L.L.C., both of Northbrook, IL; and sold through registered representatives or bank employees who are licensed insurance agents. Please check for availability in your specific state.


These policies have limitations and are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains details on the variable annuity, the subaccounts, contract features, fees, expenses, and other pertinent information.


Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of a fund before investing. For a prospectus containing this and other information for any variable annuity or variable life product that invests in Putnam Variable Trust funds, contact your financial advisor for a contract prospectus and prospectus for the underlying funds. You may also call Hartford at 1-800-521-0538 or Allstate at 1-800-390-1277. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.


For the most recent month-end performance, please call Hartford at 1-800-521-0538 or Allstate at 1-800-390-1277.
