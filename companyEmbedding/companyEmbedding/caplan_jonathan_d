Commentary: What will Bill Clinton be wearing?

Former President Bill Clinton gestures while speaking in support of his wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Thursday, April 14, 2016, at the Community College of Rhode Island in Warwick, R.I. (Steven Senne, AP)

Garrison KeillorSpecial To The Washington Post




It's good to hear that Bill Clinton will be put in charge of revitalizing the economy in a Hillary administration and be sent to troubled areas such as Appalachian coal country and inner-city Detroit, and not just promote literacy or physical fitness, the usual first lady things. But I hope that at state dinners and other major White House events, we'll be able to read about what he's wearing.Mr. Clinton captivated attention with his form-fitting pale-blue Vargas jacket with asymmetrical side vents and matching trousers, pleated, with empire waist and half-inch slanted cuffs, mauve-striped silk shirt with rounded collar, and coral-red tie, sequined, but it was his footwear, the moccasins, no socks, that had the crowd all a-twitter. A spokesperson for the first gentleman declined to comment. Just because you're in charge of revitalization doesn't mean you have to go around in a cape with blue tights and a big red S on your chest and red underwear over the tights, a man should be able to wear a light Dacron-linen blend suit now and then too, maybe with a bold blue-striped shirt and an orange polka-dotted tie.




Art Caplan, Jonathan D. Moreno


As unusual as the 2016 presidential election has been, one obvious aspect has gone largely unnoticed: By the time the next president of the United States is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017, he or she will have reached or come close to reaching 70 years old. 

That all the remaining major candidates...



As unusual as the 2016 presidential election has been, one obvious aspect has gone largely unnoticed: By the time the next president of the United States is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017, he or she will have reached or come close to reaching 70 years old. 

That all the remaining major candidates... (Art Caplan, Jonathan D. Moreno)

Let me say what nobody has said in print for eight years: Barack Obama looks terrific. He is slim, athletic, and you never see him looking slovenly; even in casual dress he looks very well put together. He never gets credit for this. I guess the Washington press corps thinks it would trivialize the role of Leader of the Free World to discuss his choice of necktie. (If the Big Snapper is elected in November, this will change: He’ll be wearing his own labels and product placement will be very important in his administration, even huge.)

Bill Clinton is looking good, too. As No. 42, he was overweight, pasty-faced and sweaty, and now, thanks to a timely health scare, he looks like a million bucks. Why shouldn't he dress up a little? For centuries, men have felt obliged to look dumpy as a mark of superior intelligence and go slouching around in baggy brown suits and unruly hair so people will think they're too brilliant to ever think about their appearance. Einstein was responsible: The genius who looked like a tramp. Advertising men and interior decorators were allowed to dress up, as befitting their trades, but a novelist such as myself had to wear jeans and black T-shirts to be taken seriously as a chronicler of postmodern despair. Now that I am a newspaper columnist, I am free to look however I feel. Today I am wearing a traditional MacKay-plaid kilt with black knee socks and a dagger in my left shoe, while bare-chested except for a leather bandolier and a necklace of wolf teeth. Next week, it may be a velvet tuxedo.Everybody is wondering if white men will vote for Hillary and, speaking as a white man, I say it depends a lot on Bill. If he looks happy on the sidelines gazing up at her with dewy-eyed admiration, then yes. We white men are looking to expand our mission. We built the bridges, made the trains run on time, raised the flag at Iwo Jima, and taught high-school physics while writing novels, pitching no-hitters, and singing our way into the hearts of millions, and now we'd like to relax a little. We are over-represented in statuary and on American currency (Andrew Jackass, get the hell off the $20 bill) and now we'd like to assume a lesser role.We white men are primarily responsible for good humor. This is true. Women are ambitious, elbowing each other for advantage, and minority men are satirists and shrewd observers, and we white guys are the ones responsible for chuckling and saying, “Hey, how's it going?” We are pretty secure in this role. Put us in a fit-and-flare floral shirt and leather slacks and black pumps and we're OK with that, too. It doesn't mean we want to use the women's bathroom.The election is simple, it comes down to the town librarian versus the town drunk. The Republicans try to portray her as the dragon lady, but if you've ever heard her speak, you recognize her essential librarian nature. The big question is Bill. Can he be happy, even as he revitalizes the strip-mined ruins of Appalachia and burnt-out blocks of Detroit, and go off to the Kennedy Center looking good in a midnight blue Armani tuxedo with a honeydew shirt accented by diamond studs and cuff links and a metallic silver bow tie with flecks of taupe?Washington Post Writers GroupGarrison Keillor is the host of “A Prairie Home Companion.”

Commentary: We need unbiased medical exams for presidential candidates







Biddiboo, Getty Images

Art Caplan, Jonathan D. Moreno




As unusual as the 2016 presidential election has been, one obvious aspect has gone largely unnoticed: By the time the next president of the United States is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017, he or she will have reached or come close to reaching 70 years old.That all the remaining major candidates are among the "young old" at this stage of the election process is unprecedented. Yet, in spite of the stakes for the American people, there is no independent source that can provide an adequate accounting of the medical condition of the next president.Historians have examined the ways that previous administrations have been affected by the medical problems of presidents including Abraham Lincoln, William Henry Harrison, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan. The news has not always been positive.So what have we done to help independently vet those who would lead the most powerful nation on earth? Nothing.

Currently the candidates release information produced by their own doctors, entirely at their discretion. The most amusing recent example is a letter signed by Donald Trump's personal physician that failed to include any data and simply assured us that he "will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." This is unlikely to prove true, considering the remarkable fitness of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, whose physical examinations while president were made public.Hillary Clinton's doctor's letter was far more detailed and persuasive, including a summary of her medical history, current medications, results of routine medical tests for blood pressure and cholesterol, and her diet and exercise routine. Bernie Sanders has released a similar letter from Congress' attending physician. But in every case the doctors were chosen by the candidates.

Aren't voters owed an independent accounting? Even competent physicians' judgments and recommendations can vary, especially when they know what the stakes are for their wannabe-president patients. One of the rationales for our interminable election process is that it enables the voters to get to know the views and temperaments of the candidates. What about their physical capacity for the job? We might like to think that the rigors of a lengthy and strenuous campaign can give us such insight. But the candidates' physical capacities might be masked by medication, health management that could be a more serious liability when in office.Our system invests so much authority in a single individual as head of state, chief executive of the federal government and commander in chief that the ways in which any medical conditions might affect performance must be explored by a process that doesn't allow for self-censorship. An independent examination by a panel of physicians at, say, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, would at least provide voters with some trustworthy information. The results might influence not only the voters' thinking but also the selection of a vice president whose "heartbeat away" status might become much more intensely apparent.

If you think of the presidential primaries as a hiring process for nominees, the Republican Party is about to offer the job to Donald Trump. As they say in the executive suite when a personnel crisis arises: Alert the folks in Human Resources.

Our proposal would apply to all presidential candidates, regardless of age, and to the presidents themselves while in office. We recognize that in creating a requirement for independent assessment some will call for more than the standard physical and mental clinical information. At an extreme, given the capacities of modern medical science, some may even want to see a genomic analysis. Someday a deep genetic dive might be defensible, though that day is not quite here. Today there are well-established conventions for a physical examination that have earned prognostic credibility.With so much at stake, an independent medical assessment not controlled by the candidates seems very little to ask. All voters may not care about the health status of the candidates, but the information should be available.Arthur Caplan is a professor of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center.
