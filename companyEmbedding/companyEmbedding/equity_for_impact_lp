PnL Explained

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

PnL Explained also called P&L Explain, P&L Attribution or Profit and Loss Explained is a type of report commonly used by traders, especially derivatives (swaps and options) traders and produced by Product control, that attributes or explains the daily fluctuation in the value of a portfolio of trades to the root causes of the changes.
P&L is the day-over-day change in the value of a portfolio of trades typically calculated using the following formula: PnL = Value today - Value from Prior Day

Report[edit]
A PnL Explained Report will usually contain one row per trade or group of trades and will have at a minimum these columns:

Column 1: PnL --- This is the PnL as calculated outside of the PnL Explained report
Column 2: PnL Explained --- This is the sum of the explanatory columns
Column 3: PnL Unexplained --- This is calculated as PnL - PnL Explained (i.e., Column 1 - Column 2)
Column 4: Impact of Time --- This is the PnL due to the change in time.
Column 5: Impact of Prices --- This is the PnL, i.e., the change in the value of a portfolio due to changes in commodity or equity/stock prices
Column 6: Impact of Interest Rates --- This is the PnL due to changes in interest rates
Column 7: Impact of Volatility --- This is the PnL due to changes in volatilities. Volatilities are used to value Option (finance) (i.e., calls and puts)
Column 8: Impact of New Trades --- PnL from trades done on the current day
Column 9: Impact of Cancellation / Amendment - PnL from trades cancelled or changed on the current day

Methodologies[edit]
There are two methodologies for calculating Pnl Explained, the 'sensitivities' method and the 'revaluation' method.
Sensitivities method[edit]
The Sensitivities Method involves first calculating option sensitivities known as the Greeks because of the common practice of representing the sensitivities using Greek letters. For example, the delta of an option is the value an option changes due to a $1 move in the underlying commodity or equity/stock. To calculate 'Impact of Prices' the formula is

Impact of Prices = Option Delta * Price Move

so if the price moves $100 and the option's delta is 0.05% then the 'Impact of Prices' is $0.05.
Revaluation method[edit]
The Revaluation Method recalculates the value of a trade based on the current and the prior day's prices. The formula for Impact of Prices using the Revaluation Method is

Impact of Prices = (Trade Value using Today's Prices) - (Trade Value using Prior Day's Prices)

for some small value assets such as loose tools

Depreciation = value at the beginning of the year (opening balance) + purchases in the year - value at the end of the year (closing balance)

PnL Unexplained[edit]
PnL unexplained is a critical metric that regulators and product control within a bank alike pay attention to.
PnL Attribution is used to test the hypothesis that the risk factors identified for a risky position are sufficient to materially explain the value change expected from the risky position;. Such that if position sensitivities to those risk factors are calculated, then the value change observed over a day can be attributed to the market price change of those risk factors, with the magnitude of the estimated as a sum product of the risk factor sensitivities and the corresponding daily risk factor price change.
Any residual P&L left unexplained (PnL Unexplained) would be expected to be small IF the identified risk factors are indeed sufficient to materially explain the expected value change of the position AND if the models used to calculate sensitivities to these risk factors are correct. PnL Unexplained is thus a critical metric that when large may highlight instances where the risk factors classified for a risky position are incomplete or the models used for sensitivities calculations are incorrect or inconsistent.[1]

What is 'Brand Equity'
Brand equity refers to a value premium that a company generates from a product with a recognizable name, when compared to a generic equivalent. Companies can create brand equity for their products by making them memorable, easily recognizable, and superior in quality and reliability. Mass marketing campaigns also help to create brand equity.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Brand Equity'
      Brand equity has three basic components: consumer perception, negative or positive effects, and the resulting value. First and foremost, brand equity is built by consumer perception, which includes both knowledge and experience with a brand and its products. The perception that a consumer segment holds about a brand directly results in either positive or negative effects. If the brand equity is positive, the organization, its products and its financials can benefit. If the brand equity is negative, the opposite is true.Finally, these effects can turn into either tangible or intangible value. If the effect is positive, tangible value is realized as increases in revenue or profits and intangible value is realized as marketing as awareness or goodwill. If the effects are negative, the tangible or intangible value is also negative. For example, if consumers are willing to pay more for a generic product than for a branded one, the brand is said to have negative brand equity. This might happen if a company has a major product recall or causes a widely publicized environmental disaster.General Example of Brand EquityA general example of a situation where brand equity is important is when a company wants to expand its product line. If the brand's equity is positive, the company can increase the likelihood that customers might buy its new product by associating the new product with an existing, successful brand. For example, if Campbell's releases a new soup, the company is likely to keep it under the same brand name rather than inventing a new brand. The positive associations customers already have with Campbell's make the new product more enticing than if the soup has an unfamiliar brand name.Specific Example of Brand EquityBrand equity is a major indicator of company strength and performance, specifically in the public markets. Often times companies in the same industry or sector compete on brand equity. For example, an EquiTrend survey conducted on July 14, 2016, found that The Home Depot was the number one hardware company in terms of brand equity. Lowe's Companies, Inc. came in second, with The Ace Hardware Corporation scoring below average.A large component of brand equity in the hardware environment is consumer perception of the strength of a company's ecommerce business. The Home Depot is an industry leader in this category. It was also found that, in addition to ecommerce, The Home Depot has the highest familiarity among consumers, allowing it to further penetrate the industry and increase its brand equity.

What impact does brand equity have on profit margins?


    By Investopedia | February 17, 2015 — 8:21 AM EST    






Share









































A:
Brand equity refers to the value of a brand name. If customers are willing to pay more for a product from a particular company than for a generic product, that company has brand equity. An example of brand equity is the clothing manufacturer Lacoste. A golf shirt festooned with the Lacoste alligator typically retails for much higher than a similar shirt with no alligator; many customers happily pay the premium because they associate Lacoste with prestige and sophistication.
Brand equity can also be negative. If a brand has a huge product recall, for example, or is involved in a highly publicized environmental disaster such as the 2010 BP oil spill, some customers actively avoid that brand, and the brand name becomes a liability rather than an asset. Brand equity impacts profit margins by affecting profit margin per customer, sales volume and customer retention.
When customers attach a level of quality or prestige to a brand, they perceive that brand's products as being worth more than products made by competitors, so they are willing to pay more. In effect, the market bears higher prices for brands that have high levels of brand equity. The cost of manufacturing a golf shirt and bringing it to market is not higher, at least to a significant degree, for Lacoste than it is for a less reputable brand. However, because its customers are willing to pay more, it can charge a higher price for that shirt, with the difference going to profit. Positive brand equity increases profit margin per customer because it allows a company to charge more for a product than competitors, even though it was obtained at the same price.
Brand equity has a direct effect on sales volume because consumers gravitate toward products with great reputations. For example, when Apple releases a new product, customers line up around the block to buy it even though it is usually priced higher than similar products from competitors. One of the primary reasons why Apple's products sell in such large numbers is that the company has amassed a staggering amount of positive brand equity. Because a certain percentage of a company's costs to sell products are fixed, higher sales volumes translate to greater profit margins.
Customer retention is the third area in which brand equity affects profit margins. Returning to the Apple example, most of the company's customers do not own only one Apple product; they own several, and they eagerly anticipate the next one's release. Apple's customer base is fiercely loyal, sometimes bordering on evangelical. Apple enjoys high customer retention, another result of its brand equity. Retaining existing customers increases profit margins by lowering the amount a business has to spend on marketing to achieve the same sales volume; it costs less to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one.
Negative brand equity has the opposite effect on customer retention and, as a result, profit margins. After the BP oil spill, the company lost many customers. Its profits immediately dipped, and BP had to pour millions of dollars into an exhaustive advertising campaign to restore its image.

     The Impact of Marketing on Customer Equity:  From Relationship Marketing to Product Marketing    Shijin Yoo and Dominique M. Hanssens♦    January 2004   ♦ Shijin Yoo is a doctoral candidate and Dominique M. Hanssens is the Bud Knapp Professor of Marketing at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.  


Abstract The customer equity (CE) concept has been successfully applied to relationship businesses such as banking, insurance, and telecommunications.  This paper takes the CE framework to product-marketing industries (e.g., consumer durables) by developing a model that can infer the impact of marketing mix efforts on CE.  Each brand’s acquisition rates and retention rates, two core elements of CE, are measured by decomposing the source of product sales into two parts: existing customers and prospects.  A vector-autoregressive (VAR) model is proposed to estimate the dynamic relationship between the marketing mix and CE.   The model is applied to the automobile industry as an empirical illustration. By comparing the CE model to the conventional sales response model, we find that the impact of the marketing mix on CE is different from its impact on sales.  While both discounting and advertising increase product sales, this sales-effectiveness is not directly translated to the development of CE in the long-run.  Brands differ in the impact of discounting on acquisition vs. retention rates.  Higher quality brands are more acquisition-effective while lower quality brands are more retention-effective.  Only one brand increases its long-term acquisition rate by advertising, and none of the brands increase long-run retention through advertising. Advertising’s short-term impact on acquisition rate differs across brands.  While advertisements by small-share and cheaper brands have a negative impact on acquisition rate, large-share and more expensive brands increase their acquisition rates by advertising efforts.  The managerial implications of the model are shown by simulating the changes induced by an incremental marketing investment in the number of customers, profits and ultimately, customer equity over time.  


Introduction Customer equity (CE) has emerged as a new paradigm for guiding managers to build strong and profitable relationships between the customer and the firm. The framework regards customers as a valuable asset that should be managed like any other financial assets (Blattberg and Deighton 1996).  Given its emphasis on a customer-centered marketing strategy, it is not surprising that the CE paradigm has been applied primarily to the relationship-marketing domain. Examples include insurance (Jackson 1989), newspapers (Keane and Wang 1995), magazines (Dwyer 1997), cellular phones (Bolton 1998), airline pilot memberships (Thomas 2001), and interactive television entertainment services (Lemon, White, and Winer 2002).1 However, in most industries managers make their marketing decisions based on product-based metrics such as sales and market share. As noted by Rust, Lemon, and Zeithaml (2001), “Business success is based on customer relationships; however, because customer equity is difficult to measure, many companies continue to focus on metrics that capture product-based strategies rather than metrics that capture customer-based strategies.” For example, managers dealing with frequently purchased consumer goods (FPCG) or consumer durables have difficulty applying the CE paradigm to their marketing decisions since the metric is not easy to measure when only product performance data are readily available. However, we argue that ignoring CE-related metrics in the product-marketing domain may mislead managers in allocating marketing   1 Since most studies define CE as a summation of customer lifetime values (CLV), we include the studies on CLV in the CE literature.  1 


resources since the product-based metrics typically fail to capture the long-run profitability impact on which the CE framework is based. For example, promotion campaigns that are known to be sales effective and therefore heavily utilized could erode the quality of the customer relationship over time in such a way that long-term profitability is declining (Jedidi, Mela, and Gupta 1999).  To make the distinction between relationship and product marketing clearer, we categorize various business situations in terms of (1) the type of relationship between the customer and the firm and (2) the type of marketing efforts mainly used by the firm (see Figure 1).2  Contractual relationship means there exists a finite-period (e.g., one year) contract between the customer and the firm for the usage of products or services.  The inter-purchase time is pre-determined based on the contract, and thus the firm can explicitly observe customer retention or defection.  However, if the relationship is non-contractual, it is harder to measure the customer’s retention/defection processes since virtually all customers have different inter-purchase times and, in general, they do not announce their future purchase plans to the firm (Schmittlein, Morrison, and Colombo 1987; Schmittlein and Peterson 1994).   The type of marketing efforts also varies.  Advances in information technology have enabled managers to implement more individualized marketing programs such as catalogues, emails, and customized coupons.  Inasfar as these marketing activities are aimed at addressable customers (Blattberg and Deighton 1991), it is relatively easy to examine their impact on CE-related metrics such as acquisition and retention rate. In   2 Note that one firm or industry could be categorized in multiple cells in Figure 1.  For instance, a car company can use either email or mass advertising, and can have either contractual (lease) or non-contractual (purchase) relationships with its customers.   2 


contrast, when mass-marketing efforts (e.g.  broadcast advertising) are used, their CE impact has to be inferred by statistical models. This paper expands the scope of the CE paradigm from the relationship-marketing (RM) domain (i.e., upper left-hand quadrant in Figure 1) to the product-marketing (PM) domain (i.e., lower right-hand quadrant in Figure 1).  Insert Figure 1 about here  Researchers in marketing have suggested several quantitative models to examine CE.  These studies include (1) measuring CE given a few critical elements (e.g., Berger and Nasr 1998), (2) allocating marketing resources under the CE maximization (e.g., Blattberg and Deighton 1996), and (3) linking CE to other business metrics (e.g., Gupta and Lehmann 2003).  However, the literature has been surprisingly silent in investigating the impact of marketing efforts on CE, which should be comprehensively examined before applying the CE paradigm to marketing decision making processes.  Therefore, it is necessary to build a model that can (1) infer the dynamics of CE when some or all critical variables are latent, and (2) capture the impact of marketing efforts on CE.  These are the main objectives of the current study.   To achieve these tasks, we first discuss the existing literature in CE/CLV research area and show why the current study is necessary to both managers (especially in the PM domain) and researchers.  We then develop an appropriate model to examine the dynamic relationship between marketing efforts and CE.  Next, we apply our model to the automobile industry as an empirical illustration.  Based on the empirical result, we then discuss managerial implications by simulating CE dynamics for two selected brands.   3 


Conclusions, limitations, and a further research agenda will be discussed in the last section.  Literature Customer equity is generally defined as “the sum of the discounted lifetime values of all customers” (e.g., Blattberg, Getz and Thomas 2001; Rust, Zeithaml and Lemon 2000).  Each element of the definition can be interpreted or measured in a somewhat different way (Berger and Nasr 1998).  For instance, “all” customers could include the firm’s current customers as well as expected future customers.  If the CE definition only includes current customers, future acquisitions and interactions within the customer group are ignored, i.e., CE is defined in a static way.  We will refer to this definition as static customer equity (SCE). A frequently used SCE metric is due to Blattberg and Deighton (1996).  They suggested a simple formula for SCE under fixed acquisition rate (a), retention rate (r), acquisition cost (A), retention cost (R), contribution margin (m), and time discount rate (δ):   1RrSCE am A a m rδ=−+ − r+−  (1)   This definition is particularly useful in segmenting and thus prioritizing customers in terms of their lifetime values (e.g. Hansotia and Wang 1997). By ignoring future acquisitions, static CE may underestimate the value of customers. Therefore, some researchers include not only the value of current customers but also that of expected future customers in their CE calculation (e.g. Gupta, Lehmann and Stuart  4 


2002).  In this approach, which we call dynamic customer equity (DCE), customers are regarded as renewable resources (Drezé and Bonfrer 2003). In what follows we will use the dynamic definition of customer equity3. Thus Equation (1) needs to be extended to allow for future customer acquisitions, as well as interactions between acquisition and retention.   Acquisition Rate and Retention Rate Among the elements of customer equity, acquisition rate and retention rate are particularly important, because they are market response variables and we must understand how they relate to marketing spending. However, acquisition and retention rates are difficult to obtain in a product-marketing environment since the metrics are constructed by investigating customer-based performance (e.g. number of retained customers) instead of product-based performance (e.g. sales volume).   Acquisition and retention rates have been modeled in different ways in the CE literature.  They have been assumed to be fixed (e.g., Berger and Nasr 1998) or time varying (e.g., Gupta, Lehmann and Stuart 2002) metrics.  Some researchers treat them as exogenous from marketing actions (e.g. Wang and Splegel 1994), while others consider them as endogenous variables affected by the firm’s marketing effort (e.g., Blattberg and Deighton 1996).  We propose to model acquisition and retention rates as time-varying endogenous variables, since our goal is to investigate the dynamic relationship between the firm’s marketing actions and CE via acquisition and retention rates.  Therefore, acquisition and retention rates are alternative metrics that capture the firm’s market   3 Hereafter, we will use customer equity (CE) and dynamic customer equity (DCE) interchangeably.   5 


performance.  In addition, we will develop a method for measuring acquisition and retention rates in product-marketing scenarios in which managers typically observe only product-based transactions.   The Impact of Marketing Mix on Customer Equity Blattberg and Deighton (1996) measured the impact of marketing on CE by decision calculus, assuming one-to-one relationships between acquisition/retention spending and acquisition/retention rates, respectively.  However, their approach is subject to two important limitations. First, it does not recognize the dynamic effects of current spending on future acquisition and retention. The economics and marketing literature (e.g., Heckman 1991; Seetharaman and Chintagunta 1998) show that customer purchase behavior is not zero order.  Similarly, marketing spending levels may depend on past decisions and market responsiveness (Dekimpe and Hanssens 1995).   Second, their approach excludes factors other than marketing spending. For example, if increased customer satisfaction leads to higher retention, acquisition rates may increase as well due to enhanced word-of-mouth from satisfied customers. Thus CE develops over time not only through marketing investments, but also by word-of-mouth.  Ignoring these forces will likely result in an underestimation of the impact of marketing on CE.   Rust, Lemon, and Zeithaml (2001; 2004) also investigated the impact of the firm’s marketing efforts on CE through three drivers: value equity, brand equity, and relationship equity.  Individual-level Markov switching matrices were estimated based on each customer’s utility function determined by these three drivers, and the firm’s CE was calculated by summing up customer lifetime values inferred from the switching matrix.   6 


They calculated how various sub-drivers (e.g., advertising) could affect CE via the three main drivers using customer survey data.  However, their approach is based on stated responses or intention, which may not correctly represent the customer’s actual behavior (Morrison 1979).  Model Development We propose to link product-based metrics such as sales volume and customer-based metrics such as retention/acquisition rate by a sales decomposition, and thereby to enable managers in the PM domain to examine the dynamics of CE-related metrics.  Once we acquire time series of these metrics, the dynamic relationship between the marketing mix and CE will be investigated by an econometric time-series model.  Modeling Acquisition Rate and Retention Rate Acquisition rate can be defined as “number of acquired prospects (or equivalently, new customers) divided by number of prospects,” and retention rate can be defined as “number of retained customers divided by number of existing customers.”  The difficulty in measuring acquisition rate and retention rate in the PM domain arises from two facts.  First, since purchase frequencies differ across customers, managers cannot use calendar time as a time unit for calculating these rates.  For instance, if all customers purchase a firm’s products once a year, then the retention rate can be easily calculated by observing their renewal rates.  However, in most product categories, customers and prospects have different inter-purchase times.  Second, the denominators, the number of prospects and customers, are not easy to observe in many cases, as product-oriented companies  7 


typically do not have accurate information about their total number of existing customers or prospects.     We propose using conditional acquisition and retention rates to make them tractable in the PM domain.  The acquisition rate for a focal brand at time t can be decomposed as:    NNN111sales purchase purchasequantity incidence// AP AP PRO AP AP PROttt ttttP PRO P PRO PRO Ptt ttt tAP PRO PROtttPRO AP PtttNNN SQNaNN N SQ NSQNSQN−−−== ⋅ = ⋅=⋅⋅1− (2)  where N is the number of prospects; S is sales; and Q is purchase quantity.  The superscript P stands for total prospects, AP for acquired prospects, and PRO for prospects who purchase the product category at a particular point of time.  Therefore, given purchase quantity and purchase incidence ratio, we can write the conditional acquisition rate (acq) at time t as:  APtttPROtSaacqS∝=  (3)  By the same logic, the conditional retention rate (ret) at time t can be defined as:    RCtttCUStSrretS∝=  (4)  where the superscript RC stands for retained customers, and CUS stands for customers who purchase the product category at a particular point of time.  8 


The conditional acquisition and retention rates can be measured by examining a simple Markov switching matrix as shown in Figure 2 (see Rust, Lemon, and Zeithaml 2004 for a similar approach).  Each brand sales ( ) can be decomposed in two parts: sales originating from retained customers ( ) and from acquired prospects ( ).  Likewise, competitors’ total sales ( ) are generated from two sources: sales originating from the focal brand’s lost customers ( S) and from lost prospects ( ).  With these decomposed sales, we can calculate the conditional acquisition rate and retention rate since OSRCSAPSCSLC LPS  (5) PRO AP LPttCUS RC LCttSSSSSS=+=+tt In sum, given purchase quantity and purchase incidence ratio, the acquisition rate and retention rate can be inferred by investigating sales originating from prospects and existing customers.  Therefore, Equations (3) and (4) are the central connections between customer equity and product marketing.    The Long-Run Impact of Marketing Efforts on Acquisition and Retention We investigate the marketing mix effects on acquisition and retention rates by a vector auto-regressive (VAR) model (Dekimpe and Hanssens 1999), for several reasons.   First, the model can capture the long-run aspects of the relationship among these variables.  Since the measurement of CE should consider future acquisition/retention processes, the model should be able to separate short-term and long-term effects.  Moreover, the VAR model is capable of dealing with evolving variables that do not have fixed means, trends and variances.  Second, the VAR model can also capture possible  9 


indirect effects among the variables.  For example, acquisition rates may be affected not only by advertising, but also by retention rates, inasfar as existing customers generate word of mouth to future prospects.  Impulse response function (IRF) analysis quantifies such complex dynamic interactions among the variables in the VAR model.  Third, due to parsimonious estimation and intuitive metrics (e.g., IRF elasticity), the VAR model is easily understood and adapted by managers (Little 1979).  CE Model vs. Sales Model The starting point for our CE model is the VAR sales response model proposed by Dekimpe and Hanssens (1999):    (6)  11 12 1321 22 23131 32 33SSllltttkMllltllllCM CMtttucSSMc M uCM CMcuψψψψψψψψψ−−=−      =+ +        ∑lMtltllltllM where S is sales volume (units or revenue), M is a company’s own marketing efforts, and CM is competitive marketing efforts.  This model is easily extendable to multiple marketing mix variables and multiple competitors, and operates in the product-marketing domain. We transform this model to the relationship-marketing domain by substituting the sales variable by acquisition rate and retention rate:     (7) 11 12 13 1421 22 23 24131 32 33 3441 42 43 44acqacq lll l tttretret lll lpttlll lMMltttlll lCM CMtttcacq acqret retcMcCM CMcεφφφφεφφφφφφφφ εφφφφ ε−−=−−         =+ +            ∑  10 


For example, the impact of own marketing efforts M on the acquisition rate acq - and thereby CE – is investigated by the impulse response of acquisition rate to a shock in own marketing effort. We will compare the impact of the marketing mix on acquisition and retention (i.e. the CE domain) in model (7) with its impact on sales from model (6).  In this way, we can investigate to what extent the use of product-focus metrics agrees with or conflicts with the purpose of growing customer equity. In the next section, we apply the proposed model to an empirical dataset and illustrate how the marketing mix effects on CE may be measured via acquisition and retention rates.   Empirical Illustration The proposed model is applied to the automobile industry, for several reasons.  First, switching behavior is relatively easily observed in this industry, since most customers trade in their used cars when purchasing a new vehicle.  Thus researchers can observe the origin of each sales (i.e. from customers vs. from prospects) based on this traded-in model information.  Second, unlike impulse-buying product categories, an automobile purchase requires a high involvement of the customer, so that the long-run dynamics of acquisition and retention become managerially more meaningful.  Third, since automobile manufacturers have both horizontal (e.g., sedan vs. SUV) and vertical (e.g., compact vs. luxury) product assortments, the CE framework is more relevant than in the case of the single-product firm which has limited opportunity for cross-selling and up-selling.   11 


Data Weekly transaction data from 1/10/99 to 6/30/02 (182 weeks) in the luxury- passenger car product category (including SUVs) are provided by the Power Information Network (PIN).  The data are aggregated in terms of traded-in and currently-purchased brands.4  Following PIN’s definition of the luxury category results in twelve brands, however we will discard three brands - Jaguar, Land Rover and Saab - due to an insufficient number of transactions.  The remaining nine brands, however, cover 92.2% of the luxury category.  The focal market consists of 26 regional sub-markets (e.g., Southern California) representing over 70 percent of the US national market.   On the marketing side, the dataset includes price-related variables such as vehicle price, consumer rebates, and annual percentage rate (APR) for financing.  These data are supplemented with monthly advertising expenditure data by brand, provided by Competitive Media Reporting (CMR).  The expenditures include virtually all media types including magazines, newspapers, TV, radio, and outdoor advertisements implemented by both manufacturers and dealers.  We first calculate daily advertising expenditures for each manufacturer5, and then convert daily figures into a weekly data series.  Finally, product quality and customer satisfaction data are obtained from three annual studies conducted by J.D. Power and Associates: the Automotive Performance Execution And Layout (APEAL) study, the Initial Quality Study (IQS), and the Vehicle Dependability Index (VDI) study. We do not incorporate distribution data in this application because, in   4 By brands we mean make-level names such as Lincoln or Lexus.  The firm-level names such as Ford or Toyota will be called manufacturers, and product names within brands such as the Lincoln LS or the Lexus RX300 will be called models. 5 We implicitly assume that, for example, advertising for both Ford and Lincoln will affect purchases of the Lincoln brand.   12 


the mature US automobile market, there were no meaningful changes in dealer networks for the luxury brands during the period under study. Some descriptive statistics of the variables in the study are presented in Table 1  Insert Table 1 about here  The time-series data on acquisition and retention are constructed as follows: we first decompose the number of transactions for each brand into two origins: purchases by customers who traded in (1) the same brand and (2) a different manufacturer’s brand.6 For instance, Lexus transactions can be separated into purchases originating from Lexus or Toyota owners and from others such as Nissan or Ford owners.  We then decompose total competitors’ sales for each brand into two similar origins.  For example, total competitors’ sales of Lexus are divided into sales originating from Lexus or Toyota customers and from others.  In sum, we construct four sales figures for each brand, labeled as (1) sales originating from retained customers, (2) sales originating from acquired prospects, (3) sales originating from lost customers, and (4) sales originating from lost prospects.  Figure 3 shows an example of this sales decomposition.  Insert Figure 3 about here    6 This manufacturer-based data construction enables us to derive CE implications at the firm level, including retention and up-selling.  As an illustration, Lincoln-to-Lincoln repeat purchases as well as Ford-to-Lincoln up-sell purchases are beneficial to Ford as a manufacturer.    13 


VAR Model Specification VAR model specification requires a test on the stationarity of each endogenous variable.  We use both the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test with a null of non-stationarity and the Kwiatkowski-Philips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test with a null of stationarity to verify the presence of unit roots in the data.  When both tests confirm the existence of a unit root we treat the variable as evolving.  The motivation for this conservative approach is that the conventional ADF test can fail to reject the null of non-stationarity too often and therefore over-estimates the existence of a unit root (Kwiatkowski et al. 1992).  When more than one variable in a VAR system is found to be evolving, we implement Johanson’s cointegration test to capture a possible long-run equilibrium among the evolving variables7. Based on the results of unit-root and cointegration tests, VAR systems are specified with corresponding adjustments on the endogenous variables.  If a variable is found to be non-stationary, first-differenced forms are used to prevent spurious regressions (Granger and Newbold 1974).  If evolving variables are cointegrated, error-correction terms are added to the VAR model to measure the system’s adjustment toward the long-run equilibrium (Dekimpe and Hanssens 1999).  When all variables are non-stationary with cointegration, the CE response model can be specified in matrix form as:    (8)  1ki==+ + + +∑t i t-i t t-1 t∆Yc Φ∆YΨZΛΧ ε where  14

An appropriate lag order (k) is selected by comparing Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) for each lag with a maximum of twelve8.  The above VAR system is estimated for each brand, which results in nine VAR systems each for the sales-response and the customer-equity response model.  Brand-specific VAR models are widely used in   7 For a more detailed discussion of unit-root and cointegration tests, see Dekimpe and Hanssens (1999) or Nijs et al. (2001). 8 Lütkepohl (1985) showed that the Schwarz Criterion (SC) is superior in lag order recovery and forecast accuracy for low ordered (<3) VAR models. However, in higher-lag systems the AIC may outperform the  15 


marketing (e.g. Pauwels, Hanssens and Siddarth 2002) and offer a rich set of diagnostics while avoiding over-parameterization.     Endogenous Variables Following Equation (3) and (4), we define the conditional acquisition rate (A) as the ratio of brand sales from acquired prospects to category sales from total prospects, and the conditional retention rate (R) as the ratio of brand sales from retained customers to category sales from total existing customers.  We then transform the acquisition rate and retention rate with the logit operator since the variables are bounded between zero and one.  Hence,  ln ;        ln1tttttacq retACQ RETacq ret==−1t− (9)  A discounting index ( ) variable is constructed as the price index variable in van Heerde, Leeflang, and Wittink (2002).  We first calculate customers’ average monthly payment (MON) based on vehicle price (PRI), rebate (REB), and APR (APR) as follows:  oDIS  ()11(1 )tttttAPRMON PRI REBAPRτ=−⋅−+ (10)     SC in forecast precision (Lütkepohl 1993). We use the AIC in this application because the data are weekly and marketing’s impact is known to extend for more than two weeks.   16 


where τ is the length of payment periods.  The ratio of “undiscounted” monthly payments with zero rebate and 7% APR9 to this “discounted” monthly payments is calculated.  Therefore, the lower the monthly payment, the higher the discounting index variable.  We use each brand’s weekly advertising expenditure for the advertising () variable.  All monetary values are adjusted by the consumer price index (CPI). oADVWe use the heaviest discounting and advertising by competitors as measures of competitive discounting (DISc) and competitive advertising (ADVc ).  Since there are nine focal brands, we estimate nine CE models with six endogenous variables each and nine sales models with five endogenous variables each.  This specification provides parsimony in both estimation and interpretation, though it lacks a detailed explanation of brand-specific competitive structure within the category, which is beyond the scope of this paper.    Exogenous Variables Several exogenous variables are included in the sales response and customer equity response VAR system. First, a deterministic trend (t) is added in the model to account for any systematic industry or national economic trends.  Second, seasonal dummy variables are included for periods with unusual transaction activity: Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, and the last month of each quarter (Pauwels et al. 2003).  Third, we include step dummy variables to account for the impact of new-product introductions by (NPI).  Following PIN’s definition of “new product”, 16 models (e.g. the Acura MDX) launched during the observation period are included in the VAR system.    9 7% APR is used as a proxy for the prime rate.  17 


Fourth, an index variable for product quality and customer satisfaction (CS) is included by taking the average of annual z-scores from the APEAL, IQS, and VDI studies10.   Impulse Response Functions The dynamic impact of one variable on another in the VAR system is analyzed by IRFs.  We follow the generalized IRF approach proposed by Pesaran and Shin (1998) and introduced in marketing by Dekimpe and Hanssens (1999).  The statistical significance of the IRFs is verified by standard errors obtained by a Monte Carlo simulation (e.g., Nijs et al. 2001) with 250 replications. In order to make the results comparable, we calculate IRF elasticities as explained in Appendix 1. All elasticity measures are based on the level form of the original variables.  For example, the response elasticity of retention rate to an advertising shock means a percent change in retention rate to a percent change in advertising expenditure.  Unlike Nijs et al. (2001), we use arc-elasticity instead of point-elasticity, since both logit and logarithmic transformations are used in our VAR systems.   Results Unit-root test results As shown in Table 2, the stationarity of each endogenous variable in the VAR system is verified by the ADF test and confirmed by the KPSS test.  Eleven of sixty three variables (17.5%) are found to be non-stationary, showing some interesting patterns.  First, the dynamics of product sales do not necessarily coincide with those of customer   10 The average z-score is used to avoid collinearity since these three scores have inter-correlations between 0.36 and 0.58.  18 


equity metrics.  For instance, while Audi’s sales volume is found to evolve, the brand’s acquisition and retention rates revert to their long-term means (i.e., stationary).  This result implies that Audi’s observed sales increase11 does not translate to an increase in its long-run customer equity. Second, retention rates are found to be stationary for all brands while some brands’ acquisition rates are evolutionary.  In other words, in this particular category, some brands manage to improve (or worsen) their efficiency of customer acquisition, but none of the brands can change the efficiency of their retention efforts in the long run.     Insert Table 2 about here  Lastly, we find only one case of cointegration among Cadillac’s acquisition rate, discounting, and advertising.  Both trace and max-eigenvalue tests reveal at most one cointegration relationship among the three variables.12  The Impact of Discounting on Customer Equity We report the IRF elasticities of sales, acquisition rate, and retention rate to the shock of the discounting index variable in  .  Following the literature in time-series analysis in marketing (e.g. Pauwels, Hanssens, and Siddarth 2002), we show IRFs with |t|-statistics greater than unity.  The table distinguishes between short-term effects (in the same week), intermediate effects (during the dust-settling weeks) and long-term effects (after 26 weeks), following the definitions of Dekimpe and Hanssens (1999).  Table 3  11 The coefficient of the trend variable in the unit-root test equation for Audi is significant and positive.  19 


 Insert Table 3 about here  As expected from the extant literature (e.g. Tellis 1988), discounting (i.e., price promotion) has a significant short-term impact on sales volume.  In addition, seven of nine brands have significant lagged effects,13 and Audi and Mercedes-Benz have long-term effects.  All brands’ discounting efforts either increase or maintain their sales volume.  However, this positive sales response is not necessarily converted to an improvement in customer equity.  For instance, even though Audi has positive intermediate and long-term impacts of discounting on sales volume, the responses of retention and acquisition rates are not significant.  Similarly, while Lincoln has positive short-term and intermediate effects, the brand’s discounting activities only deteriorate its CE in the long run due to a negative long-term impact on acquisition rate.   The role of discounting efforts in the CE domain differs across brands.  Some brands’ discounting is relatively effective in increasing acquisition rates while other brands are more retention effective.  For instance, extra discounting by Lexus increases only its acquisition rate, whereas Cadillac’s discounting increases only its retention rate while the brand’s acquisition rate is negatively affected by the marketing activity.  Thus we may categorize auto brands in two groups: acquisition-effective and retention-effective brands.  The former include all Japanese brands (Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus) and the latter include American brands (Cadillac and Lincoln).  Managers can use this    12 Detailed unit-root and cointegration test results are available from the first author upon request. 13 The number of lags varies across brands (mean = 6.78, range = 1 to 18 weeks).  20 


information to diagnose the impact of their marketing efforts in more detail and to better allocate marketing resources to existing customers vs. prospects. We conjecture that these important differences in discounting effectiveness across brands are related to their levels of product quality and customer satisfaction.    Figure 4 illustrates with simple regression analysis how that the difference between acquisition-effectiveness and retention-effectiveness is associated with both initial quality (measured by IQS, R2 = 0.60) and reliability (measured by VDI, R2 = 0.34).  We observe that price discounting actions by brands that have relatively higher quality and customer satisfaction, are more effective in acquiring new customers than in retaining existing customers, and vice versa for brands that have relatively lower quality and customer satisfaction.  Thus, if customers are satisfied with a high-quality product, their repeat purchase decisions are less likely to be affected by their favorite brand’s marketing interventions such as price discounting. Instead, such brands can use discounting more effectively to attract new customers, so that the firm can successfully grow its market share in this mature product category.  This conclusion is corroborated by the observation that three Japanese high-satisfaction brands increased their combined annual market share from 21.8% to 31.8% while two lower-satisfaction U.S. brands decreased theirs from 23.3% to 16.6% during the three-year observation period.    Insert Figure 4 about here  On average, across these nine brands, we find that discounting rarely increases a brand’s customer equity in the long run.  Only Acura enjoys a long-run positive impact  21 


of discounting on its acquisition rate, and no brands can increase long-run retention rates by discounting.  Moreover, Lincoln and Cadillac’s discounting have negative long-run impacts on acquisition rate.  Thus if a manager at Lincoln or Cadillac only examines the impact of discounting on sales volumes, its negative influence on customer equity may go unnoticed.  In fact, Cadillac’s short-term sales increase induced by discounting comes mainly from customer retention, but in the long run, this discounting has a negative effect on the efficiency of acquiring prospects.  This finding may also be interpreted as a negative long-term impact of price promotions on the health of brands (Blattberg, Briesch, and Fox 1995).  It is also consistent with a result from Pauwels et al.’s study (2003) that rebates generally do not increase the firm’s shareholder value in the long-run.                   The Impact of Advertising on Customer Equity Table 4 shows the impact of advertising on sales volume and CE.  Consistent with past literature (e.g. Sethuraman and Tellis 1991), advertising has much smaller effects on sales than discounting.  Seven of nine brands do not show significant contemporaneous effects of advertising on sales, and only Acura and Mercedes-Benz increase their long-term sales by advertising. However, as in the case of discounting, the impact of advertising on sales volume is not directly translated into the CE domain. First, positive impacts of advertising on sales do not always correspond to an increase in CE.  For instance, even though BMW enjoys a positive short-term sales effect of advertising, the brand does not significantly increase its customer equity by this advertising.  Similarly, Audi’s advertising does not significantly impact its sales, and actually deteriorates this brand’s customer equity.   22 


The observed differences in sales vs. CE effects of advertising may be explained as follows. Acquisition and retention rates are metrics that capture not only a “revealed” top-line performance (i.e., acquired prospects and retained customers) but also “hidden” lost opportunities (i.e., lost prospects and lost customers).  Given the same level of sales volume, acquisition and retention rates could increase or decrease depending on the underlying lost opportunities that are affected by other forces such as competitors’ marketing efforts and word-of-mouth between existing customers and prospects.  For example, if extra advertising induces strong competitive reactions over time, a brand may face a decrease in customer equity due to tougher competition even though it maintains the same sales volume.  Second, consistent with Deighton, Henderson, and Neslin’s findings (1994) in FPCG categories, advertising does not have any direct significant impact on retention rate in the short-run.  In Deighton et al.’s terminology, “usage dominance” plays a more important role in this market than “framing” effects between advertising and customer.   Several years of experience with a luxury automobile makes the evidence of the product quality “unambiguous” (Hoch and Ha 1986) so that advertising can hardly affect customer’s judgment of the product.  While we find some significant intermediate effects of advertising on retention rate, these impacts may be explained by competitive reactions, performance feedback and word-of-mouth effects.  Decomposing these dynamic effects (Pauwels 2003) is an interesting topic for future research. Third, the short-term and intermediate impact of advertising on acquisition rate supports the proposition that advertising provides valuable information to customers and thus increases competition among brands.  Only Mercedes-Benz has a positive long-term  23 


effect of advertising on acquisition rate, but Audi, Infiniti, and Volvo have only negative impacts.  Other brands do not have any significant impacts.  Interestingly, among nine brands, Infiniti (2.2% market share) and Audi (5.6% market share) are the smallest brands in terms of market share, and Infiniti, Volvo, and Audi are second, third, and fourth cheapest brands, respectively, in terms of average vehicle prices.  Mercedes-Benz (21.0% market share), which has a positive long-term impact of advertising, has the biggest market share and is the most expensive brand in the product category. This result can be interpreted that for smaller brands, direct persuasive effects are dominated by cross effects of competitive reactions by other brands.  Bigger brands have advantages in advertising in the long-run (Kent and Allen 1994).  Non-significant advertising effects on acquisition for five of nine brands show that there exists little switching from competitive brands to the advertising brands (Raj 1982).  In fact, in a recent study by Banerjee and Bandyopadhyay (2003), the authors analytically showed that given a significant portion of customers who have latent inertia of repeat purchase, advertising is not an effective competitive marketing tool for small firms, who generally compete on the basis of price.   Insert Table 4 about here  So far we have examined the dynamic impact of marketing on acquisition and retention rates.  Using these results, one can investigate how the firm’s marketing mix affects its DCE, which is a nontrivial combination of acquisition rate, retention rate, marketing costs, contribution margins, and time discount factors.  In the next section, we numerically illustrate the impact of an extra marketing intervention on DCE and other  24 


managerially relevant metrics such as number of customers and profits.  We describe how dynamic customer equity unfolds over time for two different brands who initiate a discounting effort that has different dynamic effects on their acquisition and retention rates.  A Numerical Simulation of Customer Equity We first derive DCE at time t as a function of conditional retention rate (r), conditional acquisition rate (a)14, and the current number of existing customers (Nt), total number of customers in the product category (Nc), retention cost per customer (R), acquisition cost per prospect (A ), category sales (Sc), and time discount factor (δ).  Assumptions and derivations can be found in Appendix 2.  As a result, CE evaluated at time t can be expressed as:   1(1 )() ((1 )titiicctccVDCENARrmam SamANSaSNraδδδ∞+==+−+ − −=+++−+∑)c (11)  where Vt stands for the value of customers at time t.  Note that this derivation is an extension of Blattberg and Deighton’s (1996) SCE formula. It incorporates the dynamic aspects of customer equity as well as a modified analytical solution to Gupta et al.’s (2002) discrete version of customer equity calculation. We simulate how an unexpected marketing intervention such as a $2,000 extra discount affect the future stream of number of customers, profits, and customer equity for  25 


two brands: Acura and Lincoln.  We use each brand’s impulse response of acquisition rate, retention rate, and discounting to a discounting shock in order to calculate the total impact of this $2,000 extra discount.  Note that Acura enjoys a long-term positive impact of discounting on acquisition rate, while Lincoln has a negative impact.  Moreover, Lincoln’s extra discount has a longer decision inertia (10 weeks) than Acura’s (3 weeks), resulting in more supplemental spending in the future.  Insert Table 5 about here  As shown in Table 5, we first calculate the focal metrics under normal business conditions derived from the data and several assumptions explained in Appendix 2.  For instance, using sample averages of vehicle price, retention rate, and acquisition rate, we are able to calculate the status quo scenario under the assumptions on current number of customers, total product category sales, contribution margin, and time discount factor.  Using the same assumptions, we then re-calculate number of customers, profit per period, and customer equity with a $2,000 extra discount by using the IRF elasticity estimated from the model.  By comparing these two scenarios (i.e., status quo vs. marketing intervention), we investigate how the firm’s marketing mix affects CE-related metrics. In this numerical illustration, Acura successfully develops its CE even in the status quo scenario, mainly due to its high average retention rate (57.0%) and acquisition rate (11.6%).  The brand also expands its customer pool and achieves higher per-period profits over time.  Implementing the extra marketing activity helps Acura increase its CE     14  For ease of exposition, we use the notation r and a for conditional retention and acquisition rate,  26 


beyond the status quo scenario.  A main driver of this increase is the long-term effect of discounting on acquisition rate.  An interesting difference exists between short-term profit and customer equity.  In the same week when the extra discount is implemented, Acura’s profit is significantly reduced (21.8% of status quo profit), but its customer equity increases (102.5% of status quo CE) due to the expected customer value the marketing effort will generate in the future. On the other hand, Lincoln fails to increase its CE by discounting efforts.  One year after the marketing intervention, the brand only achieves 78% of its status-quo customer equity. Note that Lincoln’s decrease in number of customers is small (2% decrease in one year) compared to its reduction in CE.  The main reasons for the CE decline for Lincoln are the inertia in the company’s decision process and the inefficiency of acquiring new customers.  That is, while Acura’s incremental marketing efforts quickly dissipate back to normal, Lincoln keeps spending at higher levels without achieving higher market response (i.e., acquisition and retention rates).  Moreover, in the long run, the brand’s acquisition rate is negatively affected by the extra marketing effort.  As a result, the extra marketing intervention by Lincoln, while sales effective in the short run, has a negative impact on the brand’s future CE development.  Conclusion In this paper, we show how product marketers can infer the impact of their marketing mix efforts on the dynamics of customer equity via retention rate and acquisition rate.  Using a series of switching matrices, we calculate four different sales    respectively.  27 


figures for each brand, viz. sales originating from existing customers, new customers, lost customers, and lost prospects.  We then construct the time series of two core elements of CE: retention rate and acquisition rate.  The long-run impact of marketing mix efforts on CE is investigated by estimating VAR models and calculating impulse responses of retention rate and acquisition rate to the shock of corresponding marketing efforts. The main contribution of this paper is to derive customer-equity metrics from conventional product-based metrics such as sales, and thus to derive the long-term customer-relationship consequences of various product-marketing actions. The proposed model enables managers to assess the health of their brands by comparing the impact of marketing efforts on customer equity vs. sales.  By comparing these impacts, managers can re-allocate their marketing resources to maximize the long-term value of the firm.  As an example in our empirical illustration, even though Lincoln’s discounting has a positive short-term and intermediate impact on sales volume, it has a negative long-run impact on customer equity, and thus should be avoided as much as possible. The main findings of this paper can be summarized as follows: • In the product marketing environment, acquisition rate and retention rate can be measured by decomposing sales into four parts: sales from existing customers, from new customers, from lost customers, and from lost prospects. • The impact of the marketing mix on customer equity is different from its impact on sales.  In an empirical illustration for the automobile industry, both discounting and advertising increase product sales, but discounting does not increase customer equity in the long-run.  Only one of nine brands increases its long-term acquisition rate by advertising.  28 


• Brands differ in the source of their CE increase induced by discounting efforts.  Higher-quality brands are more acquisition-effective, and lower-quality brands are more retention-effective.   • Advertising does not have a significant impact on retention rate both contemporaneously and in the long-run. • The impact of advertising on acquisition rate is different across brands.  Advertising by small-share and cheaper brands has a negative impact on their acquisition rate, whereas advertising by large-share and expensive brands increases their acquisition rates. This paper has several limitations that offer opportunity for further research.  First, there exist other endogenous drivers of customer equity assumed to be exogenous in this paper. For example,  examining how marketing activities affect the future contribution margin for different customer cohorts is an interesting issue (Reinartz and Kumar 2000; 2003).  Second, customer equity may be more sensitive to individualized marketing efforts such as direct mail than mass marketing efforts such as discounting and advertising.  If the firm uses different marketing strategies with existing customers vs. prospects, a model may be developed that captures retention and acquisition effectiveness separately for each. Third, different product categories need to be studied. While our model can be extended to fast-moving consumer products, the sales decomposition for such categories is a challenging task because the ownership-based grouping of existing vs. new customers in this paper may no longer be appropriate.   29

 Appendix 1: IRF elasticity  In this appendix, we explain how to get IRF elasticities in a mixed case of logit and logarithm variable transformations.  If the response variable (y) is transformed with logit, and the shock variable (x) is transformed with logarithm, the IRF elasticity in a level form can be calculated as follows.  (Step 1) Transform the shock variable (x): Suppose the amount of shock in the log form is δ, then we can write as   log ' log'log'exp( )' exp( )xxxxxxxxδδδδ−====  where  'x is the value of x after the shock. Therefore, the amount of shock in the level form can be calculated as   ' exp( ) (exp( ) 1)xxx xxδδ−= −= −  (Step 2) Transform the response variable (y): Suppose the amount of response in the logit form is  γ, then we can write as   'log log1' 1'(1 ) exp( )(1 ')exp( )'1 exp( )yyyyyyyyyyyyγγγγ−=−−−⇒=−⇒=−+  where   is the value of y given the shock.  Therefore, the amount of response in the level form can be calculated as 'y  43

 Appendix 2: Derivation of Dynamic Customer Equity  To specify the relationship among retention rate, acquisition rate and customer equity, we assume that; • Category sales (Sc) are stationary  • Total number of customers (Nc) in the product category is stationary • The number of customers who purchase in the product category is proportional to the size of the customer pool for each brand • The average purchase quantity is unity and is constant over time  First, brand sales volume at time t ( ) can be expressed by retention rate and acquisition rate as   tS  111RC APtt tCUS PROtt t tccttttccSS SSrSaNNSrSNN−−=+=+=+−a where  :  sales from retained customers:  sales from acquired prospects:  category sales from existing customers:  category sales from prospects:  retention rate:  acquisition rate:  number RCtAPtCUStPROttttSSSSraNof a focal brand's customers   Second, profit at time t (V) can be expressed as, t  000()() ()RC AP CUS PROtt t t tRC APRC AP ttttttcccc ccttcc cV S S m RS ASSSSmSmR AraNNN NNNSrmS amSRSNN NN=+ − −=+− −−−=+ −− 0cA  47

This study found substantial differences in the lifetime values of customers acquired through different channels. Persistence Modeling for Assessing Marketing Strategy Performance[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The question of long-run market response lies at the heart of any marketing strategy that tries to create a sustainable competitive advantage for the firm or brand. A key challenge, however, is that only short-run results of marketing actions are readily observable. Persistence modeling addresses the problem of long-run market-response quantification by combining into one measure of â€œnet long-run impactâ€ the chain reaction of consumer response, firm feedback and competitor response that emerges following the initial marketing action. In this paper, we (i) summarize recent marketing-strategic insights that have been accumulated through various persistence modeling applications, (ii) provide an introduction to some of the most frequently used persistence modeling techniques, and (iii) identify some other strategic research questions where persistence modeling may prove to be particularly valuable.

Persistence Models and Marketing Strategy[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Long-run marketing-mix effectiveness lies at the heart of marketing strategies that try to create a sustainable competitive advantage for the brand or firm. We review contributions in the area of persistence modeling, and show how this approach allows to combine into one measure the net long-run impact of an initial marketing action. In persistence modeling, one traces the dynamic chain reaction of consumer response, firm feedback and competititve reactions. We provide both a short technical introduction to the technique and an overview of prevous applications, and identify various other strategic questions for which persistence modeling may be particularly useful.

It allows marketing researchers to advance traditional modeling and estimation approaches by incorporating dynamic processes to answer new important research questions. The authors discuss the challenges facing time-series modelers in marketing, provide an overview of recent methodological developments and several applications, and highlight fruitful areas for future research. This discussion is based on the First Annual Conference on ‘Modeling Marketing Dynamics by Time Series Econometrics’ at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA on September 16–17, 2004.
