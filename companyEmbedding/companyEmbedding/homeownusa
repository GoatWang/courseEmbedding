	Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of

	On
	January 10, 2017, the Board of Directors of Homeownusa (the
	“Company”) appointed Fai H. Chan as Director to hold
	office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until
	their successor is duly elected and qualified or until his
	resignation or removal.




	 






	            




	Fai H. Chan






	Mr.
	Chan is an expert in banking and finance, with years of experience
	in these industries. He has also restructured 35 companies in
	various industries and countries in the past 40 years.




	Mr.
	Chan serves as the CEO of Singapore eDevelopment, Ltd., a limited
	company listed on the Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities
	Trading Limited was appointed to that role on April 28, 2014. He
	was appointed a director of Singapore eDevelopment, Ltd. on March
	1, 2014.

	 

	He is
	also Non-Executive Director of ASX-listed bio-technology company
	Holista Colltech Ltd.




	From
	1992 until 2015, Mr. Chan has also served as Managing Chairman of
	HKSE-listed Heng Fai Enterprises Limited, now known as ZH
	International Holdings, Ltd. He also served as director of Global
	Medical REIT Inc. (NYSE: GMRE) from 2013 until 2015 and as director
	of American Housing REIT Inc. from 2013.




	Mr.
	Chan was also formerly (i) the Managing Director of SGX
	Catalist-listed SingHaiyi Group Ltd, which under his leadership,
	transformed from a failing store-fixed business provider with net
	asset value of less than S$10 million into a property trading and
	investment company and finally to a property development company
	with net asset value over S$150 million before Mr. Chan ceded
	controlling interest in late 2012; (ii) the Executive Chairman of
	China Gas Holdings Limited, a formerly failing fashion retail
	company listed on SEHK which, under his direction, was restructured
	to become one of a few large participants in the investment in and
	operation of city gas pipeline infrastructure in China; (iii) a
	director of Global Med Technologies, Inc., a medical company listed
	on NASDAQ engaged in the design, development, marketing and support
	information for management software products for healthcare-related
	facilities; (iv) a director of Skywest Ltd, an ASX-listed airline
	company; and (v) the Chairman and Director of American Pacific
	Bank.




	In
	1987, Mr. Chan acquired American Pacific Bank, a U.S. full-service
	commercial bank, and brought it out of bankruptcy. He
	recapitalized, refocused and grew the bank’s operations.
	Under his guidance it became a NASDAQ-listed high asset quality
	bank, with zero loan losses for five consecutive years before it
	was ultimately bought and merged into Riverview Bancorp Inc. Prior
	to its acquisition and merger, it was ranked #13 by the Seattle
	Times “Annual Northwest’s Top 100 Public
	Companies”, ranked #6 in Oregon state, ahead of name such as
	Nike, Microsoft, Costco, AT&T Wireless and
	Amazon.com.

	On
	December 22, 2016, Singapore eDevelopment purchased 74,015,730
	common shares of the Company from Cloudbiz International Pte., Ltd.
	Mr. Chan beneficially owns 56.94% of the common shares of Singapore
	eDevelopment, Ltd. and beneficially owns 100% of Cloudbiz
	International Pte. Ltd.




	 





	The board of directors appointed Mr. Chan in
	recognition of his abilities to

	assist the Company in
	expanding its business

	and the
	contributions they can make to the Company’s strategic
	direction. Mr. Chan has not yet been appointed to any board
	committees.





	 




	The
	Company has not entered into any compensation arrangements with Mr.
	Chan.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.
