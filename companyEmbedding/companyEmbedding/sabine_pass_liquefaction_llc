Sabine Pass LNG Terminal
The Sabine Pass LNG terminal is located on over 1,000 acres of land along the Sabine Pass River on the border between Texas and Louisiana, in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. It is located at the widest point on the Sabine River Navigation Channel, only 3.7 nautical miles from the open water and 23 nautical miles from the outer buoy. The channel is maintained at a depth of 40 feet and is not subject to tidal limitations. The terminal has two docks that are recessed far enough so that no part of the LNG vessel will protrude into the open waterway while docked. 
Four dedicated tugs are stationed at the terminal to ensure safe and timely escorts by crews specifically trained to berth LNG vessels. The terminal can simultaneously load or unload LNG vessels from each berth in order to maximize the number of LNG vessels that can be received at the terminal each year.
 
Sabine Pass Terminal Information
Site: 1000+ Acres
Accessibility: 40' Channel
Proximity: 3.7 Nautical Miles from Coast
Berths: 2 docks
Storage 5 tanks (17 Bcfe)
Vaporization: 4.0 Bcf/d Sendout
In Service: 2008
 
Liquefaction Project
Cheniere Energy Partners is developing, constructing and operating a liquefaction project at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities for up to six trains, with expected nominal production capacity of approximately 27.0 mtpa of LNG. For project details click here.

LNG Terminals
Cheniere is among the leading companies in North America strategically pursuing the development, construction and operation of LNG terminals.
Cheniere's premier sites, community focused approach, experienced team and anticipated low construction and operating costs provides the company sustainable competitive advantages. The Company is currently developing, constructing and operating onshore LNG export facilities and related natural gas pipelines located along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Gulf Coast area is ideally situated for LNG facilities due to its highly liquid markets, with an abundant supply of natural gas and significant network of existing pipeline infrastructure. 
Cheniere's terminal sites are among the best in North America because these sites have the following critical features:

Deepwater ship channels and large acreage positions with proximity to open water 
Substantial local natural gas consumption & existing industrial complexes
Proximity to major interstate and intrastate pipelines 
Abundant and experienced workforce
​Local governments and communities familiar with and supportive of the energy industry 

Cheniere’s competitive advantage is offering attractive options for global LNG buyers:

New source of LNG supply for the global market
LNG pricing tied to U.S. natural gas index
More flexible contract structure, including destination flexibility, ability to cancel cargo lifting with advance notice and FOB purchases of LNG (Cheniere purchases the natural gas feedstock and the customer purchases LNG at the tailgate)
State-of-the-art technology – LNG trains are designed using the ConocoPhillips Optimized Cascade® process

Cheniere recently completed construction of the first 2 LNG trains to have been built in over 40 years in North America at its Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

FERC Process
 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an LNG terminal per the Natural Gas Act.  The FERC is the lead federal agency that will determine whether Cheniere will be issued an Order Granting Authority under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act for the construction an LNG project.  The FERC will also monitor all construction and restoration activities to insure that Cheniere complies with all federal, state, and local permits, plans, and regulations. 
The Sabine Pass Liquefaction Project received a FERC order granting authorization to commence construction on the first four LNG trains on April 16, 2012, under Docket No. CP11-72-000.  The discussion below describes the process undertaken. 
 
The Approval Process
The initial step in the process was to request from FERC to engage in the Pre-Filing Environmental Review Process.  The pre-filing process provides opportunities for federal and state cooperating agencies (LDEQ, USACE, USFWS, etc.), and other public stakeholders to comment on the project impacts prior to an application to the FERC being submitted.  When permission was granted to begin the pre-filing process Cheniere will then prepare the draft resource reports.
The next step was for the company to submit the draft Resource Reports for submittal to the FERC staff to aid their preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to fulfill the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The purpose of the EA/EIS is to inform the public and the permitting agencies about the potential adverse and/or beneficial environmental and safety impacts of proposed projects and their alternatives.
The Resource Reports are divided into the following subjects:

General project description 
Water use and quality 
Fish, wildlife, and vegetation 
Cultural resources 
Socioeconomics 
Geological resources 
Soils 
Land use, recreation, and aesthetics 
Air and noise quality 
Alternatives   
Reliability and safety 
PCB contamination (not required for this project) 
Engineering and design material 

The stakeholders were given the opportunity to comment on the resource reports through public meetings and postings.  Any issues identified were addressed prior to final environmental documents and approvals being issued.  The schematic illustrates the steps involved, and the points where the public was given the opportunity to comment on the pre-filing process.
Upon FERC approval of the project, Cheniere received:

A Commission Order stating its decision on whether to approve construction and operation of the LNG terminal;  
Market rate authority; and 
Conditions that must be met prior to construction. 

Additional environmental permits and clearances that were applied for: 

Section 401 water quality certificate from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality; 
Section 404 permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers for work in wetlands; 
Coastal Zone Management clearance from the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources; 
Federal Endangered Species Clearance from the US Fish and Wildlife Service; 
State Endangered Species Clearance from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; 
Air Emissions Permit (Title V & PSD) from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality; 
Section 106 National Historic Preservation Act Clearance from the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism – received;  
Authorization to export from the Department of Energy.           

 
Design and Construction Monitoring
FERC authorized the commencement of construction once the project met all pre-construction conditions required by the FERC Order, and then authorized the commencement of construction. 
Prior to commencement of service from the LNG facility, Cheniere received written approval from FERC. Only after complying with all pre-operation conditions listed in the Commission Order does a company receive authorization to begin operation.

Corpus Christi LNG
Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC (Corpus Christi Liquefaction), a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy, is developing and constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal at one of Cheniere's existing sites that was previously permitted for a regasification terminal. The liquefaction project is being designed for five trains with expected aggregate nominal production capacity of up to 22.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG.
The Corpus Christi site is located on the La Quinta Channel on the northeast side of Corpus Christi Bay in San Patricio County, Texas, on over 1,000 acres owned or controlled by Cheniere and is approximately 15 nautical miles from the coast.
Cheniere made a Final Investment Decision (FID) and issued the notice to proceed to commence construction on the first two liquefaction trains on May 13, 2015, and is continuing to market nominal production capacity from Train 3.  To date, 8.42 mtpa has been contracted to third party, foundation customers on a long-term FOB basis under sale and purchase agreements (SPAs). Foundation customers include Pertamina, Endesa, Iberdrola, Gas Natural Fenosa, Woodside, EDF and EDP. Trains 1&2 are fully contracted and Train 3 is partially contracted. Any excess capacity not sold under long-term SPAs to foundation customers is available for Cheniere Marketing.
Our business model differs from other U.S. LNG projects in that in addition to processing natural gas into LNG (tolling model), we will procure the natural gas supply used for feedstock. Once the natural gas is liquefied, the customer takes delivery at the tailgate of the terminal. As a result, Cheniere is expected to become one of the largest buyers of natural gas in the U.S. once all of the trains are operational.
Access to Gas Supply

The Corpus Christi Liquefaction Project is positioned near some of the most prolific oil and gas producing regions in the country. Texas alone produced 27% of total U.S. marketed gas production during 2015, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Cheniere is building a 23-mile 48” pipeline that would connect the Corpus Christi LNG plant to several interstate and intrastate pipelines, giving the facility access to robust gas resources in Texas and the Gulf Coast. In addition, Cheniere has secured transport capacity on third-party pipelines under long-term agreements. Natural gas supply will be purchased from producers and marketers on a short and long-term basis to form a balanced portfolio of natural gas feedstock.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
