Mercer Promotes Talent Within and Expands Partner Group

19 March 2015
Australia,
          Sydney



Mercer today announced the promotion of six new Partners in the Pacific market.

The new Partners, all long standing Mercer employees, have been promoted as a result of their sustained performance and the value they have added to clients and customers.

They join a cohort of 44 Partners across the Pacific who work across businesses and geographies to ensure our clients and customers get the very best of what we have to offer, and they model our values every day, in everything they do.

Mercer’s Managing Director and Pacific Market Leader, David Anderson, said, “By maximising client and customer relationships, developing new business, innovating and leading by example our new Partners inspire high performance and drive profitable growth.”
“We’re proud to have recently promoted almost 100 colleagues across the organisation who have exceeded the expectations of their role, continuously developed their skills and experiences and demonstrated an aptitude for succeeding at the next level – all of which contribute to our business success.

“The talent pool at Mercer is really extraordinary. We believe we have many of the best thinkers and doers in the market. Based on our track record, we also believe we’ve got an inspiring workplace with the average tenure of our new Partners more than 12 years each. We have very capable and loyal colleagues who are given the opportunity to develop and shine at Mercer, which is a win, win for us, our people and our clients,” Mr Anderson said.
