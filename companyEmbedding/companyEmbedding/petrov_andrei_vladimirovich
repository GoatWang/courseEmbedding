Biography  
Andrei Vladimirovich Petrov



Participate in Developing a Biography for 
Andrei Vladimirovich Petrov


Please note: Artists not classified as American in our database may have limited biographical data compared to the extensive information about American artists.

Creating biographies or improving upon them is a work in progress, and we welcome information from our knowledgeable viewers.

If you feel you have worthwhile information you would like to contribute, the following means of submission is the most efficient. We welcome your involvement!
1.  For Premier Dealers and museums already 
					registered with askART your best approach is to log in, choose the artist (once 
					he/she is in your list of artists), and submit your biography there. If you are 
					a dealer or museum not currently registered, please 
						click here to register, and then you may select your artist and submit 
					a biography.

2.  For all others who have useful information 
					about this artist, please email the information to 
						registrar@askart.com. Please note: All biographies will be fully 
							viewable on Fridays, but the rest of the week biographies are available only to 
							subscribers.
Biography Guidelines
When submitting biographical information, we appreciate your consideration of 
						the following:


					Please keep in mind that askART is not a promotional site, and accordingly 
					biographical information should not be worded for purposes of 'advertising' an 
					artist.
					

					Our site is about PAINTERS, SCULPTORS, and ILLUSTRATORS. If you do not know a great deal about the 
					artist, but have noteworthy information to share, we would welcome you to send 
					it also to registrar@askart.com. It 
					is rewarding for all of us to see artists' files grow, and others may be eager 
					to supplement what you have provided.

Non-Dealers and Museums:
					Please introduce your information as follows: "The following biographical 
					information has been provided by Jane Doe, the niece of the artist."

Dealers and Museums will be automatically credited with a link to their 
					sites. 
Just the facts, please. Our editors are trained to 
					delete any hype or advertising verbiage such as “most famous,”  
					“internationally renowned,” “extraordinarily beautiful works.” 
If you do not know a great deal about the artist, 
					answer as many of the following questions as you can. Other persons, seeing 
					your entry, often add to the data. This is how many of the biographies 
					grow.

    Please include in your biography answers to as 
						many of the following questions as possible:
			


					What are the subjects and styles (and other distinctive 
						characteristics) for which the artist’s work is best known?
				
					Is the artist identified with any particular art movements, or 
							artists, who influenced his or her work?
				
					Where, when, and under whom did the artist receive education and 
							training?
				
					Can you provide all relevant personal background 
							information on the artist?
				
					In which Art Organizations was the artist a member?
				
					Can you provide a list of all major museum and artist 
							association exhibitions? (excluding commercial art galleries).
				
					What awards or other recognition did the artist win?
						
							What museums (name, city, and state) currently hold 
								works by the artist in their permanent collections?
						
Required: What are the sources for your 
								information? For books, list title, author, date of publication. (Optional: 
								cite number of pages and yes/no if there are color images.) For magazine 
								articles, cite title of article, author, title of publication, date, and page 
								number if possible.
						
Required: the name of the person submitting the 
								information.
				




Dealer Note: Please enter books, periodicals and museum 
				references in the space provided. Do not combine book information with 
				biography.

				There are many strong biographies that you may refer to on our website, such as 
				Cecilia Beaux, Edward Hopper, and Paul Sample. Please do not submit biographies 
				with minimal facts or excessively promotional writing such as the following 
				(unusable) wording:

				What NOT to send:
				     "The artist John Doe is the quintessential master 
					of light, color, and scene. His brilliant canvases are full of feeling, where 
					love can be felt through all the senses. Through his skillful brushwork, and 
					drawing from his life experiences, he creates images where the viewer feels he 
					has truly become one with the subject. Doe's paintings are sure to be sought by 
					the discriminating collector. I/we have numerous spectacular works by Doe 
					available for sale."


			We appreciate your participation in askART. If you have any questions 
			about submitting biographies, please send them to registrar@askart.com
