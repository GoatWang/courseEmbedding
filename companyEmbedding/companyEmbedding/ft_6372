Whenever I have gone to Home Depot on E. Sunrise. I Have always been greeted at the door and guided to The right aisle, where I would find an associate that would greet me and ask if I needed any help finding what I was looking for, usually I did need help locating what I came in for they were always so kind and brought me to the area I needed to be at, they always did it with a smile. Sometimes I could be frustrated but by the time I checked out I would have a smile on my face so the employees are doing something right. Thank you for all of your kindness

I really like this Home Depot.  The parking s a bit nuts but if you just go to the upper deck, it's much, much easier!
The entire staff and especially the store manager, Joe, always recognizes me (at least by sight) and he is always very friendly, helpful and quick with a smile.  Plus, on one particular occasion, he not only helped me find what I was looking for but since I had just lost my job (through an acquisition by a larger competitor) he took my (now old - business card) and offered to "bird-dog" any job opportunities if he heard of one, and he also added some words of encouragement.  It was sincere -- and his time and consideration were very much appreciated. (Joe was also great during the Holidays and allowed me to take one of the "Charlie Brown" trees to share with my elderly neighbor (outside on the lawn)!

                    Vero Shores is a wonderful, family friendly community, tucked away in the southern region of Vero Beach.  I frequent this small community quite often and it has become one of my most favorite neighborhoods in Vero Beach.  The neighborhood is very active.  Many neighbors participate in "block competitions" such as Christmas house decorating/lightings.  There are many homes in the neighborhood that are waterfront, sitting directly on the canal.  Most of them have docks with direct water access straight from the backyard.  I recently showed a waterfront home on this canal, as the sun was setting and the beauty was remarkable.  I highly recommend this delightful neighborhood!
