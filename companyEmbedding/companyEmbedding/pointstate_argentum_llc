Coflex ®

 

coflex Interlaminar Technology - P110008






This   is a brief overview of information related to FDA’s approval to market   this product. See the links below to the Summary of Safety and   Effectiveness Data (SSED) and product labeling for more complete   information on this product, its indications for use, and the basis for   FDA’s approval.


Product Name: coflex® Interlaminar Technology
Product Name: coflex® Interlaminar Technology
PMA Applicant: Paradigm Spine, LLC
Address: 505 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022
Approval Date: October 17, 2012
Approval Letter: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf11/p110008a.pdf



What is it? The   coflex Interlaminar Technology is a U-shaped, titanium alloy implant   that fits between two bones called the spinous processes located in the   lower back (lumbar region) of the spine. The device is placed between   two adjacent lower back bones after surgical relief of pressure on the   spinal cord and nerves (decompression) to ease the pain associated with   lumbar spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the passages for the spinal cord and nerves.

How does it work? The coflex device is designed to maintain a fixed distance between the   spinous processes of two lumbar segments following surgical   decompression. By limiting the ability to bend backward (extension) in   the affected area, the device may relieve the symptoms of lumbar spinal   stenosis.
When is it used? The coflex device is   intended to be implanted in the center (midline) between 1 or 2 adjacent   segments of the lumbar region of the back (from L1-L5) to provide   stability following surgical decompression of spinal stenosis at the   affected level(s).
The coflex device is indicated for skeletally   mature patients (people who have stopped growing) who experience relief   from their symptoms of leg/buttocks/groin pain, with or without back   pain when bending forward, and who have undergone at least 6 months of   non-operative treatment.
What will it accomplish? This device should help relieve some or all of the symptoms of lumbar   spinal stenosis. Unlike a fusion procedure, the coflex device is   designed to allow some motion at the affected
  level(s).
When should it not be used? You should avoid having surgery with the coflex device if you experience any of the following conditions:

Prior fusion or decompressive laminectomy at any index lumbar level
Compromised vertebral bodies at any lumbar level(s) caused by current or past trauma or tumor (such as, compression fracture)
Severe   facet hypertrophy (overgrowth of bone in the facet joint between each   vertebral body) that requires extensive bone removal, which would cause   instability
Grade II or greater spondylolisthesis
Isthmic spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis (pars fracture)
Degenerative lumbar scoliosis (Cobb angle of greater than 25 degrees)
Osteoporosis (thin or weak bones resulting from a loss of calcium)
Back or leg pain of unknown origin
Axial back pain only, with no leg, buttock, or groin pain
Morbid obesity defined as a body mass index greater than 40
Active or chronic infection – systemic or local
Known allergy to titanium or titanium alloy
Cauda   Equina Syndrome (severe spinal nerve compression causing loss of bowel   or bladder function, loss of sensation in the buttocks and groin, and   weakness in the legs)

Additional information:
The Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data and labeling are available.
