The Blackstone Group and affiliate GSO Capital have completed a $280 million IPO of a senior floating rate term fund, which will trade on the NYSE under ticker symbol BSI.
PRESS RELEASE
The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE: BX), one of the world’s leading investment and advisory firms, today announced the successful completion of the initial public offering of Blackstone / GSO Senior Floating Rate Term Fund (the “Fund”). The Fund’s primary investment objective is to seek high current income with a secondary objective of preservation of capital, consistent with its primary goal of high current income. The Fund began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) yesterday under the symbol “BSL”.
The Fund issued $280 million in its common share offering, excluding the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC (“GSO / Blackstone”), a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group, is the Fund’s investment adviser. The lead managers of the common share underwriting syndicate were Morgan Stanley, Citi, BofA Merrill Lynch, UBS Investment Bank, and Wells Fargo Securities.
“We believe that where we are today in the credit cycle offers investors an attractive entry point for investing in floating rate senior secured loans” said Dan Smith, Senior Managing Director, GSO / Blackstone. “We are pleased to be able to provide income oriented investors access to this almost $1.6 trillion market in a fund overseen by GSO / Blackstone’s experienced portfolio management and credit research team.” 





Shares of closed-end investment companies, like the Fund, usually trade on a national stock exchange. Similar to stocks, the Fund’s share price will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value.
The Fund is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company with no operating history. Investors should consider the investment objectives and policies, risk considerations, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. For a prospectus which contains this and other information relevant to an investment in the fund, please contact your securities representative. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before they invest. There can be no assurance the Fund’s investment objectives will be attained.
Forward-Looking Statements

Credit (GSO)
Putting Companies on Solid Financial Footing.





Overview

GSO is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers, with a focus on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns and capital preservation for our clients.


Our team of approximately 320 employees constitutes one of the largest in the industry. These professionals’ deep reservoir of credit expertise and experience across market cycles is further enhanced by access to Blackstone’s global resources and perspective.


As the supply of available capital is constrained by changes in financial industry regulation and global credit market conditions, GSO looks forward to continuing to provide financing solutions that enable companies to remain viable – and vital to their employees and communities – for the long term.







				A Message from Bennett Goodman, Co-Founder of GSO
			















Scale

Our scale and expertise allow GSO to provide financing solutions that enhance a corporation’s financial flexibility, while capturing opportunities for our investors.



Range of Disciplines

 Providing Solutions

GSO has provided more than $46 billion in capital in privately originated transactions to enable companies to remain viable.

 GSO GSO seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in a broad array of public and private corporate credit instruments across multiple strategies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
