Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-5, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2012-5 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-5, Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates, Series 2012-5
    





October 30, 2012 11:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2012-5, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2012-5 (SEMT 2012-5):
    

      --$296,954,000 class A certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$296,954,000 notional class A-IO certificates 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,488,000 class B-1 certificates 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$5,286,000 class B-2 certificates 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$3,684,000 class B-3 certificates 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$2,563,000 class B-4 certificates 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 7.30% 
      subordination provided by the 2.65% class B-1, 1.65% class B-2, 1.15% 
      class B-3, 0.80% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The class B-5 is not rated by Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the strong historical performance of the highest contributing originator 
      to the aggregate pool (First Republic Bank, 24.46%), the clear capital 
      structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by third party 
      underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act as the master 
      servicer and Christiana Trust will act as the Trustee for the 
      transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made to 
      treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment conduits 
      (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2012-5 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's fifth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2012. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime mortgage loans, with 100% fixed rate 
      mortgages (FRMs). The loans are predominantly fully amortizing; however, 
      4.9% have a 10-year interest-only (IO) period. The aggregate pool 
      included loans originated by First Republic Bank (24.5%), PrimeLending 
      (17%), Flagstar Bank, F.S.B. (9.3%), and Cornerstone Mortgage (6.1%). 
      The remainder of the mortgage loans (43.1%) was originated by various 
      mortgage lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to 
      the transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 390 loans with a 
      total balance of $320,339,050, an average balance of $821,382, a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 68.4%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 4.2%. Rate/term and cash out 
      refinances account for 45.7% and 8.4% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 770. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 94.3% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (44%), 
      Texas (13.4%) and Washington (5.8%).
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-5'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.
    

      In addition to the information sources identified in Fitch's criteria 
      listed below, Fitch's analysis incorporated data tapes, due diligence 
      results, deal structure and legal documents from the 17g5 website 
      available on 'www.structuredfn.com'.

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?
      


Commentary

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
