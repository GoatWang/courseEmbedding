Hercules Offshore: Challenges Ahead in 2015

Drilling contractor Hercules Offshore Inc forecast a challenging year ahead as demand for its rigs remains weak with producers scaling backing drilling due to a slump in global oil prices. Shares of the company, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, rose 21 percent to 84 cents in light trading before the bell. Demand for jackup rigs remains weak in every region of the world, Chief Executive John Rynd said, adding that a "significant" number of new rigs were expected to be delivered over the next several years, burdening an already weak market. Hercules operates 33 jackup rigs, used in shallow-water drilling. Utilization rates for the company's U.S. offshore rig division, its biggest business, fell to 60.1 percent from 83 percent, a year earlier.



Statoil: Securing More Rig Capacity


Statoil has signed a contract with North Atlantic Norway to hire the West Hercules rig which can be used for exploration and production drilling internationally and on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Statoil has signed an agreement with North Atlantic Norway Ltd (Norwegian Branch), a company in the Seadrill group, for hire of the West Hercules rig for use on exploration prospects and production licences. The semi-submersible rig will be deployed to start drilling from Q3 2012. 



Hercules Offshore Selects RigNet Communications Solutions

RigNet, Inc., a provider of managed remote communications solutions for the upstream oil and gas industry, recently announced the expansion of its contract with Hercules Offshore to provide managed remote communications to its fleet of jackup drilling rigs and U.S. Gulf of Mexico-based inland barges. Under the previous contract, RigNet provided managed communication services to most Hercules Offshore rigs operating outside of the United States. This recent agreement expands the contract to include the company's jackup rigs and inland barges in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including the recently-acquired rigs from Seahawk Drilling. With managed communications solutions provided by RigNet, Hercules Offshore's remote personnel can now access critical enterprise data, voice and broadband Internet.

The agreement, if approved, would extend a strategic alliance with Schlumberger that dates to 2011, Eurasia added. EDC is an onshore and offshore drilling and well services contractor.
