Aadhaar - The World's Largest Biometric Identity System

Aadhaar is a unique 12 digit number issued by the government as proof of identification and/or residence for residents in India. The Aadhaar number is linked to each resident - it stores the demographic and biometric information for each individual in a central database. To date, Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric identity system, with 1.2 billion users enrolled thus far. 
                





Authentication
Aadhaar uses iris enabled technology to authenticate any resident or customer and helps in reducing identity fraud.
                        



Know Your Customer
Aadhaar allows service providers to view their customers' addresses, phone numbers, and other personal details once the customer is authenticated.
                        









Uses of Aadhaar







Each resident is given a unique 12 digit Identification number, known as their Aadhaar number.
During enrollment, a user is required to register 10 fingerprints, both irises, and provide their demographic information, including a photograph.
The number is then used to authenticate the user by scanning their fingerprint or iris, sending the scan to the central database for matching, and once the user is authenticated, various services can be provided.









Iris- Creating A Better And More Improved Aadhaar







Reliable
Iris is a protected organ, unlike fingerprints does not get affected by what a person does with his or her hands. Hence provides better accuracy for Aadhaar.
                            



Wider Demographics
Iris works reliably for people across various age groups and occupation, unlike fingerprints that do not work for older people, manual laborers.
                            



Higher Security
Iris has rich pattern which makes it more unique, lowers chances of false accepts compared to fingerprints.
                            









KYC (Know Your Customer)

With an ActiveIRIS enabled devices a service provider can get reliable and accurate information about their customers from Aadhaar by simply having them authenticate themselves. Once a customer is authenticated, service providers can view their customer's address, phone number, and other personal details. 
                





Up-to-date Information
ActiveIRIS based devices can access the Aadhaar central database to get the most recent and up-to-date information about their customers.
                        



Convenient
ActiveIRIS enabled devices are convenient for both customers and service providers to use.

Delta ID Introduces Iris Scanning Technology for In-Car Biometrics and Secure Autonomous Driving at CES 2017
Jan 5 17
Delta ID Inc. introduced its iris scanning technology for automotive at CES® 2017. Delta ID has collaborated with Gentex Corporation to demonstrate the use of iris scanning as a secure, reliable and convenient way to identify and authenticate the driver in a car, and as a way to elevate the security of automobiles during the driving experience. Delta ID and Gentex will demonstrate (booth #7326 LVCC) a rearview mirror that will scan the iris of the driver upon entering the vehicle and gets ready to drive. If authorized, the driver will be able to immediately start the vehicle while the vehicle automatically adjusts to personalised in-cabin experience settings in the form of adjusted seats and mirrors, pre-defined music favorites and GPS locations, etc. Delta ID and Gentex have entered into a strategic partnership to bring iris scanning technology to automotive. Gentex's rearview mirrors will integrate Delta ID's Active IRIS® technology. Both companies believe the iris is the right modality for in-car biometric identification and authentication, and rearview mirrors are the right place to integrate iris. The integrated solution provides a high level of security along with convenience and reliability of use. The companies envision their joint offerings to enable novel use cases in the cars of the future.

Your Eyes Are Your Best Password
 The iris pattern in each human eye is unique and provides a very strong and robust authentication mechanism, even better 
                     than alternative biometric technologies such as face, eye veins, voice or fingerprints. Delta ID ActiveIRISTM  technology integrated into mobile and PC devices makes it easy - 
                     as easy as just look at the device - to securely access devices and services.
                




Device Unlock

                    With Delta ID ActiveIRISTM technology device unlocking is as easy as just looking at the device for a few milliseconds. 
                    No more remembering of PINs and passwords, no careful positioning or scanning of face, eye veins or fingers. Iris is intrinsically  
                    more secure than a 4 or 5 digit PIN, face, eye veins, voice or even fingerprint. ActiveIRIS implemented per Delta ID's reference design offers
                    security that is orders of magnitude stronger - better false acceptance rates, better resistance to spoofing.
                





Mobile Payments

                   Iris elevates security of mobile payments, both at point-of-sale terminals and online, to a new level - significantly 
                   higher than the security level achievable by fingerprints. With Delta ID ActiveIRISTM Technology a quick look is all that 
                   is required to enable very secure mobile payment transaction. Once ActiveIRISTM is securely integrated in the device per Delta ID's
                    reference design, the secure vault containing credit card related information is accessed only upon successful authentication
                    of the user's iris.

Anti-Counterfeiting

                        Counterfeiting is not a problem exclusive of luxury brands. It's a widespread problem that not only creates negative value for brands but 
                        are also puts people's lives in jeopardy when it comes to food and drugs. Even the reputation of distributors and retailers is at risk.
                    

                        Commonly used authentication mechanisms today, such as holograms, color-shifting inks, special printing, basic RFID chipped labels have 
                        shown to be ineffective in controlling counterfeiting. Some secure RFID ICs offer robust solution and a strong protection, but they are 
                        too expensive to be used at item level for high volume.
                    







Verayo offers highly effective technology to aid in the authentication of products and protect against counterfeiting
                             issues by extracting silicon biometrics and creating unclonable RFID chips.
                            

Low-cost & Unclonable
Customizable to product requirements
Multiple consumer applications









                        With a simple tap of an NFC phone, consumers can verify authenticity of the product at any time. Verayo has also built a robust 
                        platform to enable consumer engagement on top of authentication for a variety of applications: pharmaceuticals, liquor, cigarettes, 
                        luxury goods, electronic devices, cosmetics, clothing, access cards...and much more.
                    























Depending on the customer's needs, Verayo offers two possible architectures:
An offline solution that checks the authenticity of a PUF-embedded NFC chip linked to a specific product. 
                        This solution requires providing readers and tags to users and is more dedicated to supply chain stakeholders.

An online solution that allows any users equipped with an NFC-enabled phone to check in real-time the integrity of the PUF-embedded 
                        NFC tag on the product. This is the perfect solution for consumer market.






                        Verayo currently deploys these solutions, involving the production of million of chips, with its partners in Asia and South America.
                        In 2013, more than 40 million chips  were sold worldwide.

Internet of Things

                        The Internet of things (IoT) is a reality. Some experts estimate that there will be almost seven times as many connected devices in the world 
                        as there are people by 2020 (Cisco ISBG, April 2011). This idea of everyday objects being embedded with sensors and chips connected to the internet, 
                        having the ability to communicate and slowly taking over on easy daily tasks, is gaining momentum.
                    
In this smarter world, staying connected is not a problem. Ubiquitous computing is everywhere: not only smart phones 
                        and tablets, but also wearables, medical patches, smart home appliances, cloud-based security systems, intelligent cars, smart meters... and much more.
                    




Over the years, chips and sensors are becoming smarter, smaller and cheaper. And with so many applications, low-cost authentication
                     is becoming critical. Imagine a self-driving car or a civil drone communicating with a hacked server. Or medical patches and wearables sharing data with unauthorized
                      entities. This could put people's lives in jeopardy. Security is a must.
                    
Verayo uses state-of-the-art technology to produce continuous and simple IoT authentication. Each sensor or device enabled with PUF 
                        security is unique and unclonable.
                    
Opal is a proof of concept. It's a small and lightweight, proximity-based authentication token to secure access to mobile devices. Relying on the latest bluetooth, 
                        if the token is more than three feet away from a paired electronic device, all screens and data lock automatically. Each token is unique and unclonable.
                    







Unclonable ID
Light weight interface
Simple implementation





Unclonable devices provide strong user authentication and data signing. Beyond security, Verayo uses software and firmware layers to facilitate 
                        integration, simple implementation and user-friendly interface. This type of security paired with such simplicity is unlike anything else.
                    
Verayo provides robust authentication with no need for stored keys, secure memory, crypto or anti-tamper technology. This technology is reliably used to authenticate the 
                    silicon remotely and establish trust for data being read or written to an IoT endpoint.
                    








Verayo is working on multiple form factors and more functionality, seeking new partnerships for technology integration. Our small hardware can be embedded in 
                        any electronic device for additional functionality and more convenience to end users. Imagine a fitness wristband with the ability to securely lock/unlock devices
                         and authorize transactions.

Trusted Computing

                        In a world where machines are slowly taking over on easy daily tasks, authentication between two machines is critical. Strengthening communication nodes 
                        legitimacy is crucial so stakeholders can keep developing complex and efficient fully integrated machine-to-machine solutions.
                    

                        In this area, Verayo has developed PUF-based highly secure key generation mechanisms that can be easily integrated in any ASIC and FPGA. Verayo can generate
                         such a key at very small technology nodes where there is no secure memory to establish trust between machines.
                    
This technology generates volatile secrets, there is no need for trusted programming and it can be used for cryptographic applications (AES, RSA, HMAC...). These 
                        solutions have been extensively tested across different environmental conditions and have been proven to be extremely robust and reliable.

 Enterprise Application Access 

                    Passwords - remembering, storing, restoring them - is perhaps the biggest technology challenge of our times. Biometric technologies are increasingly being used to address
                     this challenge. Iris, with its advantages over face, eye veins, voice, fingerprints and other modalities provides a better fit as password. Delta ID ActiveIRISTM, with its fast and 
                     reliable recognition capabilities, provides an easier, safer, and more reliable mechanism for addressing the "password challenge" when accessing applications.

ActiveIRISTM Technology
World's First & Only Iris Recognition System Ready for Mobile Consumers


The iris has been well accepted in the biometric community as a richer modality to identify and authenticate people. It works better than face, 
                    eye veins, voice and even fingerprints - it is much more reliable, safe and secure.  Learn More

Until now iris has been primarily used by governments for defense and border control purpose. Typical iris recognition systems are 
                    not amenable for use by consumers. Delta ID is changing that.
                
Delta ID's ActiveIRISTM Technology is world's first and only iris recognition technology ready for the mobile consumers. 
                    It combines Delta ID's advanced iris recognition software with simple, inexpensive and easy to integrate hardware to enable mobile 
                    devices - mobile phones, tablets, laptops or any other devices - to do quick and reliable iris recognition in a typical mobile use 
                    scenario - when the user and device are mobile.

Integration guidelines





ActiveIRIS uses advanced computer pattern recognition techniques to create mathematical representations, called templates, out 
                    of the unique random patterns of the iris. These templates are used for recognizing the user using the following simple steps:
                





Enrollment
This is done once, perhaps when user sets up the device to use iris recognition feature. At this time the iris of both eyes is scanned to create a template.
                         The template(s) are securely stored on the device in its trusted environment.
                        



Recognition
After enrollment whenever the user switches on the iris system, the iris of both eyes are quickly scanned and compared with the 
                            stored templates to authenticate the user.
                        








ActiveIRIS Advantages

                        Delta ID's ActiveIRIS Technology has been designed to work reliably in typical consumer mobile usage scenarios - in less than optimal conditions. ActiveIRIS system is:
                        
Fastest - By far the fastest in the industry, it recognizes user in less than 150ms 
Easy-to-use - Recognize user, with or without glasses, anywhere in 20cm - 50cm comfortable distance from the device
Smart & Reliable - Matches out-of-focus, misaligned, occluded eyes, images with motion-blur, pupil dilation
Outdoor & Indoor - Works across lighting conditions with ambient reflections 
Safe & Secure - As low as 1 in 10 million false acceptance rate. Hard to spoof. Implemented in ARM TrustZone® and Intel TXT 










Iris
Iris is the thin circular structure around the pupil in the eye. It controls the size of the pupil, and hence the amount of light that 
                        gets into the retina of the eye.
                     
Iris - a better biometric modality
The iris is unique to each human being - has a different color and structure. Just like face, voice or fingerprints, the iris is also
                     a biometric modality to uniquely identify and authenticate a human being. The iris being a protected, internal organ has significant advantages:
                     
Not affected by external environment - Face and retina recognition are severely affected by lighting conditions. Voice recognition is 
                        affected by background noise. Fingerprint recognition is unreliable after washing hands, does not work for people with certain kind of occupations. 
                    
Not easily accessible - difficult to spoof - Face is available in various pictures available on the internet, social media sites. Voice can be easily recorded over phones or 
                        other chatting systems. Fingerprints are always available on various surfaces, including the mobile devices themselves.
                    
Not affected by time - Face, eye veins, finger skin, voice - all change over time, and hence prove to be unreliable. 









Iris - Better than Face, Eye Veins, Voice, Fingerprints







Easy to use
Iris is easily visible. With ActiveIRISTM a look at the mobile device is all it takes to recognize a user,
                             no need for touch, slide, scan.
                            



Wide Demographics
Iris being a protected organ. It does not get affected by age, weather, occupation and 
                                other external conditions.
                            



Secure
Unlike face, eye veins, fingerprint and other modalities, iris has lower false acceptance
                             rates, it is harder to spoof, uses trusted camera. Hence more secure.

News Description









Delta ID Inc., Announces ActiveIRIS to be used for Aadhaar Authentication  India: Delta ID, a leader in consumer-grade
iris technology for mobile devices aims at providing secure and convenient
biometric authentication. The company introduced the software ActiveIRIS which
got approved for being used in the Aadhaar authentication.
The software ActiveIRIS underwent the
Performance testing done by Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification (STQC)
in collaboration with C-DAC and Unique Identification Authority of India
(UIDAI) under the Ministry of Electronics and IT of the Government of India.
The software gained acceptance due to the
evident increase in the Aadhaar card enrolments and the inclination towards
eKYC encompassing the government and private enterprises and rise in the use of
the biometric modality considered to be reliable in context to the various
Government initiatives. Further, the iris is considered to be a more reliable
and secured means to identify and secure people, plus it works for all people
belonging to any age group, and of any working category.
The ActiveIRIS includes software for
iris capture and further has segmentation which includes the authentication for
the UIDAI servers. The software when combined with UIDAI standard compliant
iris hardware components allows the software to work reliably across population
wherein the mobile devices work efficiently.
TechSci Research depicts that company’s
efforts towards the various Government initiatives in context to the identity
authentication will result in a safer nation. It would help the company to
increase its market share in biometrics market. 
According to recent report published by TechSci Research, “India
Biometrics Market Forecast and Opportunities, 2020”, biometrics market in India is
projected to grow at a robust CAGR of over 35% till 2020. Growth in the market
is anticipated on account of increasing use of various biometric products in
government and BFSI sector across the country. Increasing use in corporate
houses, schools and industries for time and attendance monitoring, coupled with
rising demand from IT / ITeS to authenticate access to confidential data, are
other factors that are expected to propel market growth over the next five
years. The largest player in India biometrics market is HID, followed by
SecuGen, NEC, eSSL, 3M, and Honeywell. Most of these major companies operate in
India by importing products and subsequently supplying them through their
distributors in the country.

Delta ID


February 3, 2016						



Website - https://www.deltaid.com
Delta ID has made iris recognition a consumer ready technology. Its patent-pending ActiveIRIS® technology, now available in smartphones in the market, provides consumers a fast and easy way to unlock their devices, make payments, log into apps & services, all with just a quick look at their devices. Delta ID ActiveIRIS® technology is simple and inexpensive for mobile and PC OEMs to integrate.
ActiveIRIS™ Technology
World’s First & Only Iris Recognition System Ready for Mobile Consumers

The iris has been well accepted in the biometric community as a richer modality to identify and authenticate people. It works better than face, eye veins, voice and even fingerprints – it is much more reliable, safe and secure.
Until now iris has been primarily used by governments for defense and border control purpose. Typical iris recognition systems are not amenable for use by consumers. Delta ID is changing that.
Delta ID’s ActiveIRISTM Technology is world’s first and only iris recognition technology ready for the mobile consumers. It combines Delta ID’s advanced iris recognition software with simple, inexpensive and easy to integrate hardware to enable mobile devices – mobile phones, tablets, laptops or any other devices – to do quick and reliable iris recognition in a typical mobile use scenario – when the user and device are mobile.



ActiveIRISTM Software Library

Available for all phone / PC OS
Available for ARM TrustZone® and Intel TXT

Hardware reference design

Infrared LED
Infrared camera with an IR band pass filter
Integration guidelines





 
ActiveIRIS uses advanced computer pattern recognition techniques to create mathematical representations, called templates, out of the unique random patterns of the iris. These templates are used for recognizing the user using the following simple steps:
Enrollment

This is done once, perhaps when user sets up the device to use iris recognition feature. At this time the iris of both eyes is scanned to create a template. The template(s) are securely stored on the device in its trusted environment.




Recognition

After enrollment whenever the user switches on the iris system, the iris of both eyes are quickly scanned and compared with the stored templates to authenticate the user.





ActiveIRIS Advantages
Delta ID’s ActiveIRIS Technology has been designed to work reliably in typical consumer mobile usage scenarios – in less than optimal conditions. ActiveIRIS system is:
Fastest – By far the fastest in the industry, it recognizes user in less than 150ms
Easy-to-use – Recognize user, with or without glasses, anywhere in 20cm – 50cm comfortable distance from the device
Smart & Reliable – Matches out-of-focus, misaligned, occluded eyes, images with motion-blur, pupil dilation
Outdoor & Indoor – Works across lighting conditions with ambient reflections
Safe & Secure – As low as 1 in 10 million false acceptance rate. Hard to spoof. Implemented in ARM TrustZone® and Intel TXT

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Delta ID Inc. raises $5M from Intel Capital and others to bring iris recognition to mass market

NEWARK, Calif., Sept. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta ID Inc., a company focused on bringing secure and convenient biometric authentication to mass-market computing devices, announced today it has closed a $5M Series A financing from Intel Capital and other strategic investors. The financing brings Delta ID's total capital raised to date to $6.1M and will help the company meet rapidly growing demand for its products from some of the world's largest and most prominent device makers.
Delta ID has made remarkable advances in iris recognition technology, making it suitable for mainstream applications and devices. Its patent-pending ActiveIRIS® technology is fundamentally different from other solutions available in the market for iris feature extraction and comparison. ActiveIRIS® offers convenient, fast and reliable iris recognition in conditions and scenarios where users typically use their mobile and PC devices.
"We believe biometrics technology will increasingly become a part of how people interact with personal computing and mobile devices, enabling safer, more secure, and convenient user authentication," said Erik Reid, vice president of Intel's Mobile and Communications Group and general manager of its Tablet Business Unit. "Working with biometric companies such as Delta ID is a key part of Intel's initiatives to eliminate the hassle of passwords. Intel Capital's investment will help accelerate the adoption of iris recognition by the ecosystem of device manufacturers, service providers and users."
Intel Capital's investment was led by Director Arun Chetty.
Instead of considering unproven, esoteric biometric modalities for sole sourcing or ones that work only in controlled environments and pristine conditions, Delta ID took a very mature biometric modality -- the iris, well regarded by academicians, governments, and industry across the world -- and made it utterly convenient, user friendly, and easy to deploy. By offering notably lower failure rates and higher intrusion resistance than other biometrics, Delta ID is making electronic payments and other secure transactions markets more accessible to its customers.
"The addition of Intel Capital as a strategic investor allows us to uniquely influence the future of biometrics technologies in mass-market computing devices, and enable a more secure and convenient way for users to access services through their devices," said Dr. Salil Prabhakar, President and CEO of Delta ID Inc.
About Delta ID
Delta ID was founded in 2011 with the mission to bring secure and convenient biometric authentication to mass market computing devices. Delta ID's ActiveIRIS® technology includes patent-pending software to enable iris recognition using simple hardware that can be easily integrated in mobile and PC devices. Delta ID is based in Newark, California. For more information, please visit http://www.deltaid.com.
About Intel Capital
Intel Capital, Intel's global investment and M&A organization, makes equity investments in innovative technology start-ups and companies worldwide. Intel Capital invests in a broad range of companies offering hardware, software, and services targeting enterprise, mobility, consumer Internet, digital media and semiconductor manufacturing. Since 1991, Intel Capital has invested more than US$11 billion in over 1,370 companies in 56 countries. In that timeframe, 207 portfolio companies have gone public on various exchanges around the world and 354 were acquired or participated in a merger. In 2013, Intel Capital invested US$333 million in 146 investments with approximately 49 percent of funds invested outside North America.

NEW DELHI, India, Sept. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta ID Inc., a leader in consumer-grade iris scanning technology for mobile devices, announced today that it has been awarded certification for its ActiveIRIS® technology by STQC, Ministry of Communication and IT, Government of India. Delta ID has licensed ActiveIRIS technology to Samsung for integration into Samsung mobile devices. The two companies have collaborated to integrate this technology in the Samsung Galaxy Tab Iris, India's first mobile device with iris scanner for Aadhaar (India's biometrics based resident authentication system).








Delta ID's ActiveIRIS technology combines its patented hardware design and advanced software algorithm to bring iris scanning and recognition to mobile devices that is fast and easy to use for consumers, and simple and inexpensive for mobile OEMs to integrate. Delta ID was the first company to bring iris scanning and recognition technology to market in collaboration with Fujitsu and NTT DOCOMO in the F-04G smartphone in May 2015. Since then the company has launched its ActiveIRIS technology in multiple mobile devices from Fujitsu, Samsung and other major OEMs.
The Aadhaar system in India now has more than 1 billion residents enrolled. It is extensively used by the government and private enterprises in India to authenticate residents, and verify their personal information such as name, address etc. (electronic-Know-Your-Customer or eKYC). The iris has already proven to be a more secure and reliable modality to identify and authenticate people. The iris works across a broader population, and unlike fingerprints, the iris being a protected organ -  remains unaffected by external conditions. The integration of iris technology in mobile devices is expected to further expedite the use of Aadhaar across many more services from both the government and private enterprises.  
"I believe we are at that the cusp of a major change in how biometrics, particularly, iris scanning will play in enabling access to a variety of services we use via our smartphones and tablets," said Dr. Salil Prabhakar, president and CEO of Delta ID Inc., "It has been a privilege to work with the Samsung team on the integration of our iris technology to bring India's first Aadhaar enabled mobile device to market. We are confident the citizens of India will find it easy and convenient to use for Aadhaar authentication and eKYC applications."
