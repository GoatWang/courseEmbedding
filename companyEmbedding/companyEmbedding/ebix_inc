                    TEAM-UP



Ebix TEAM-UP Download is the first commercially available "off-the-shelf"
                product that provides carriers with an easy transition from their traditional download
                "mailbox" methodology.

                Basic Features and Benefits:

                Ebix TEAM-UP Download brings extra services and features to you and your agents
                that you have never had before:

All leading agency systems are supported and we're adding more regional systems
                    every week. TEAM-UP Download is now in production with 41 different agency systems.
                
Real-time archive retrieval provides quicker service to your agents. Files can be
                    downloaded from the archive in a matter of seconds, not days as they currently experience.
                
Reduce IT support requirements by eliminating the need to rebuild download files.
                    TEAM-UP Download can resend a file with the click of a button. 
Dramatically reduce your download costs by eliminating transaction fees, byte fees,
                    long distance fees, compression fees, etc.
Expand your download without adding cost
                    
add new agents to your download at no cost
add lines of business to your download at no cost


TEAM-UP download provides the highest level of security and encryption available
                    and can be integrated into a carriers existing site authentication process.
                
TEAM-UP Download uses the AL3 files that you're currently downloading to your agents
                    -- you DO NOT have to get re-certified by the agency systems!

                        CertsOnline



                        Whether your organization is large or small, publicly or privately held, Ebix Risk Compliance Solutions (RCS) can customize its product offering - CertsOnline to meet your unique requirements.
                        CertsOnline is a full-service insurance tracking product that has the flexibility to
                        validate and monitor insurance coverage requirements contained in any type of agreement,
                        for any type of organization. While the core Ebix RCS product offering is intended
                        to relieve your organization of the time consuming and labor intensive aspects of insurance
                        compliance tracking, Ebix RCS also offers partial tracking solutions allowing your
                        organization to retain responsibility for some of the components included in the
                        tracking process.

                        The value proposition offered by Ebix RCS goes beyond the tracking service itself.
                        Our people possess years of knowledge gained from working with hundreds of organizations
                        on insurance/risk transfer issues and can share this knowledge with you to help
                        fine-tune your compliance approach.

                        When it comes to insurance compliance monitoring, each industry presents a distinct
                        set of challenges for establishing the service component necessary to meet the needs
                        of our customer. Ebix RCS has gained considerable expertise in handling the insurance
                        compliance needs of organizations in more than 20 different industries.

                        National Service Center


                            The Ebix RCS National Service Center is staffed by a team of 75 dedicated professionals
                            responsible for the management of 5000 service transactions each business day. Documents
                            showing evidence of insurance coverage arrive at the Ebix RCS service center each
                            day via mail, fax or email, and are sorted, scanned, and entered into the tracking
                            database by members of the Ebix RCS service team.

                            Immediately after data has been extracted from the insurance documents and entered
                            into the tracking system, the coverage information provided is compared to our client's
                            pre-established insurance requirements to determine if the coverage provided meets,
                            or fails to meet, their minimum requirements. If deficiencies, such inadequate coverage
                            limits, lack of a proper additional insured endorsement or unacceptable carrier
                            ratings, are detected, notices are sent that very day to advise the insured of the corrective
                            action needed to achieve compliance.

                            The National Service Center operates from a dedicated facility located in Hemet,
                            California.



                        Technology


                            Ebix RCS's proprietary insurance tracking software – CertsOnline was designed exclusively
                            for monitoring incoming Certificates of Insurance. Continuously improved for over
                            the past decade, the system automates all aspects of the insurance tracking process
                            that traditionally required costly, time-consuming manual processes.

                            Since no two customers are alike, we will customize the system to your precise specifications
                            and reporting needs. The Ebix RCS tracking system provides a comprehensive set of
                            management and activity reports. Once the tracking system is in place, Ebix RCS
                            will continue to add enhancements to reflect your current business realities. Only
                            Ebix RCS offers this unique level of customization. You may also choose to have
                            the data created and collected by Ebix RCS automatically exported (real time or
                            batch) to your own host system (e.g. A/P, ERP or Contract Management). Our in-house
                            IT staff will work with you to coordinate a seamless flow of information using the
                            data interface method of your choice.

                            Document Imaging:

                            Certificates, and all related documents, are electronically imaged upon receipt
                            and instantly become a part of your insurance records and account history. Document
                            images are permanently maintained online allowing you to review current and historical
                            documents with ease. All certificates and other documentation are formatted for
                            easy printing via standard office printers.

                            Secured Internet Access:

                            Clients may access complete transaction histories and complete image history for
                            all records on the Ebix RCS system. The system is available on a 24/7 basis. With
                            system availability exceeding 99.9%, you can monitor your insurance compliance status
                            anytime you choose to do so. Access privileges to the website are controlled by
                            log-on ID, and include various authority levels based on each client's policies.

                            Customization:

                            Ebix RCS customizes system functionality for each client based on the client's unique
                            business structure, contractual insurance requirements, and reporting needs. In
                            addition to managing Certificates of Insurance, Ebix RCS can also customize the
                            system to assist with other compliance management needs.




                        Implementation & Training


                            Implementation:

                            Time is a valuable commodity. That is why we place a great deal of emphasis on making
                            sure that each and every new client implementation is completed on schedule. With
                            more than 200 successfully executed new client implementations under our belt, Ebix
                            RCS has the expertise and experience to make your transition to our full service
                            Certificate of Insurance management service as easy, efficient and effective as
                            possible.

                            Early in the implementation process, Ebix RCS’ manager of new client implementations
                            develops a plan taking into consideration all essential elements of the implementation.

Depending on your circumstances, the options for implementation can range from:


Ebix RCS simply taking over the insurance monitoring responsibility directly from
                                where you leave off 
Ebix RCS conducting a full-coverage audit 


                            Ebix RCS supplies each new client with a customized implementation guide that identifies
                            all of the components that must be considered for conducting a smooth, efficient
                            implementation. We will work with you to help you gather and organize your data
                            and will help you summarize your insurance coverage requirements. During the implementation,
                            we also share information gained from our years of experience and will consult with
                            you about likely outcomes of decisions made during this phase.

                            Training:

                            All information gathered or created by Ebix RCS (e.g. certificate images, reports,
                            coverage information, transaction history) is accessible via a secure, on-line access
                            to the Ebix RCS system. The system was designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use.
                            There is no need to be an insurance expert to use the Ebix RCS system effectively.
                            Users quickly become comfortable with the simple and easy-to-navigate system design.

                            As a part of your program implementation, an the on-line system will be established based
                            on your criteria and will be quality tested. Ebix RCS’s training staff will work
                            with you to make sure that you are completely comfortable with the on-line system and
                            its features prior to initiating service to you. Subsequent to your coming on board
                            with our service, Ebix RCS will provide training, at no additional cost, to new
                            employees joining your team after initiation of the Ebix RCS service.

                            Ebix RCS will also provide you with customized user manuals containing screenshots
                            for every system screen and field definitions for all data elements.
