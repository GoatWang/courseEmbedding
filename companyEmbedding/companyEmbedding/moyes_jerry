Jerry Moyes

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Jerry Moyes is the founder, chairman and CEO of Phoenix-based Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States. Moyes is also owner of charter airline Swift Air. Moyes is also controlling owner of SME Steel Contractors Inc., a steel erector company based in Utah. He was a majority owner of the Phoenix Coyotes of the National Hockey League before the Coyotes filed bankruptcy and were sold to the NHL in 2009, and the Arizona Sting of the National Lacrosse League. Moyes is also a limited partner in the Arizona Diamondbacks, and was once a minority owner of the Phoenix Suns.
A graduate of Weber State College, Moyes is currently vice president at large of the American Trucking Association and previously served as president of the Arizona Motor Transport Association.
Near the end of 2016, Jerry announced he will retire at the end of the year. Richard Stocking currently holds the title of President and CEO of Swift Transportation.
Jerry and his wife Vickie have been married for over 39 years and have 10 children and 10 grandchildren.
Phoenix Coyotes[edit]
Moyes was originally a minority partner in Steve Ellman's ownership group, which bought the Coyotes from Richard Burke in 2001. On Sept. 26, 2006, Ellman sold controlling interest in the Coyotes, Arizona Sting, and the lease to Jobing.com Arena to Moyes. He retained Wayne Gretzky as part-owner and head of hockey operations.
Court filings show Moyes was never keen to own the Coyotes and had no interest in hockey. He acquired control of the club in 2006 after falling out over a real estate development with former business partner Steve Ellman. Afterwards, Moyes tried to find a buyer for the Coyotes, and he chafed at the league's interference in his attempts. In 2008, Moyes told Gary Bettman and other league officials that he would stop funding the club. The league agreed to provide emergency funding in return for Moyes turning over his voting control. The acrimony was made public in May 2009 when Bettman and Daly came close to selling the Coyotes to Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox, a move that would have seen Moyes receive almost nothing from the sale. On May 5, 2009, Moyes promptly put the Coyotes into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced a plan to sell the club to Jim Balsillie. Moyes also filed a lawsuit against the NHL, alleging the league was an “illegal cartel.” Bettman was furious, arguing the league had been blindsided and that Moyes did not have the authority to put the club into bankruptcy protection.[1]
Moyes was saddled with massive financial losses that dated to the time the former Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix. Unable to turn around the team's fiscal picture, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 5, 2009. As part of the filing, he agreed in principle to sell the Coyotes to a group headed by Research in Motion co-CEO Jim Balsillie, who intended to move the team to Hamilton, Ontario. The league responded by stripping Moyes of virtually all of his ownership authority, though he is still nominally the team's owner. The NHL argued that Moyes had no right to make the filing because numerous agreements he'd signed with the league in return for financial assistance specifically barred him from filing for bankruptcy. It also claims that Moyes effectively surrendered control of the team by signing the agreements. A bankruptcy judge has scheduled a hearing for May 19, 2009 to determine who actually controls the team.
In October 2009, Baum rejected the NHLs bid, as well as Balsillie's $242.5-million offer. The judge ruled that Balsillie's bid faced too many legal obstacles, however, he said the NHL could revise its bid to include concessions to Moyes and Gretzky. The NHL had originally taken the position that neither Moyes and Gretzky were legitimate creditors because they were owners. Under Chapter 11 proceedings, owners usually rank below other creditors and rarely receive any of the proceeds from asset sales. On November 2, 2009, Moyes officially sold the Coyotes to the NHL for $140 million.[2]

About[edit]
Carl Moyes was a truck driver hauling produce for C. R. England Trucking in the 1940s out of northern Utah.[3] In the late 1950s Betty and Carl Moyes started a small trucking company in Plain City, Utah, B & C Truck Leasing, and after their son, Jerry, graduated from Weber State University in 1966, they moved the small company to Phoenix, Arizona. Carl, and his two sons, Ronald and Jerry (vice-president), formed the company, as Common Market, in Arizona, that would become Swift.
Operations began in 1966 transporting imported steel from the ports of Los Angeles, California to Phoenix, Arizona, and then returning with cotton from Arizona to be delivered to Southern California.[4]
The name Swift Transportation was purchased from a descendant of the Swift Meat Packing family, when the Moyes family bought the trucking assets of Swift & Company. The three Moyes's and a fourth partner, Randy Knight, grew the business to $25 million in annual revenues by 1984. Jerry became president, chairman, and CEO that same year, and when Carl died in 1985, Jerry bought out his other two partners, his brother Ronald and Randy Knight. Ronald would continue to hold shares in Swift while Randy would become a co-founder in Knight Transportation.[5]
In April 1988 Swift purchased Greenville, South Carolina-based Cooper Motor Lines from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based ARA Services.[6]
By 1990, Swift Transportation had grown to a $125 million carrier with over 800 trucks.[4] The company did an initial public offering (IPO) in 1990 and became a publicly traded entity on the NASDAQ market system under the symbol SWFT.
In 1991, with money raised in the IPO, Swift bought Stephens City, Virginia-based Arthur H. Fulton Inc. for $9 million. Fulton was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the time.[7]
In a similar move, in 2001 Moyes purchased all of the properties, assets, and accounts of Dick Simon Trucking, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Those assets were rolled into Moyes' small Central Freight Lines out of Texas, and later spun off as the separate corporate entity Central Refrigerated Service, which remained wholly owned by Moyes until its subsequent sale to and merger with Swift. The sale was announced in summer 2013, and the merger completed and operating authority officially transferred to Swift On February 1, 2014. Moyes received $180 million in cash for the sale.
The company growth has continued since 1988 with the purchasing of (11) different motor carriers throughout the United States, including M.S. Carriers, of Memphis, Tennessee in 2000. The shareholders of M.S. Carriers obtained a 22% stake in the combined company.[8]
Moyes was about to retire, but was forced out as chief executive officer (CEO) at Swift in October 2005 after a United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into insider trading. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing he paid a $1.26 million settlement. The Moyes family still controlled about 39% of the issued public stock.[9][10]
In November 2006 Moyes offered to buy Swift for $29 a share. The offer was raised to $2.4 billion ($31.55 per share) for all outstanding shares not controlled by the family and assuming $332 million in outstanding debt, the transaction was closed on May 10, 2007.[11] To finance the acquisition, Moyes formed Saint Acquisition Corporation, and issued $2.1 billion of a senior secured credit facility and $835 million in second-lien senior secured notes.[9] The company's drivers and eighty-three percent of all outstanding shares (approximately half of those controlled by the family) supported the buyout.[10]
Swift’s terminal network grew to over forty full service facilities in both the continental United States and Mexico, but then closed a few after the 2008 financial recession. The total number of employees dropped from 21,900,[12] to approximately 17,700.[1] Swift owns 100% of Trans-Mex, a Nuevo Laredo, Mexico-based carrier. Swift offers border crossing services at all major Mexican border crossings. Swift maintains a presence in every Canadian Province.[4]
The company operated 16,200 units (12,300 tractors by company drivers and 3,900 owner-operator tractors), a fleet of 48,600 trailers, and 4,500 intermodal containers from 35 terminals in the United States and Mexico, generating just over $2.5 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009.[1]
Swift Transportation went public once again on December 16, 2010, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[13] The company offered 73,300,000 shares at $11.00 per share, raising almost $766 million, with the proceeds being used for debt reduction. The offering represented 54.9% of the company, valuing the company at $1.86 billion. Due to the economic downturn, the IPO was below Moyes leveraged-buyout (LBO) price of $17.61. With the offering the name officially change from Swift Holdings Corp. to Swift Transportation Company.[1][14]

Arizona transportation mogul and former Phoenix Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes in the midst of a couple of business-related legal battles.
Moyes is president of Swift Aviation Inc. and is founder and chairman of Swift Transportation Inc. Moyes owned the Coyotes hockey team from 2006 to 2009, when he put the team into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

U.S. Bank National Association and Cessna Corp. have filed separate civil lawsuits against Moyes related to Swift Aviation.
The U.S. Bank claim is the much larger of the two.




U.S. Bank filed suit against Moyes and his wife, Vicki Moyes, in 2012 claiming a default related to a $10 million credit line. Court documents show the credit line has some association with $10 million worth of Phoenix Industrial Development Authority bonds for a 2002 Swift Aviation project near Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
Maricopa Superior Court Judge Richard Gama ruled in favor U.S. Bank last month issuing an $8 million default judgment.
Attorneys for Swift Aviation and Moyes have filed motions for reconsideration on the judge's ruling. The dispute also centers around some questions over the structure of the credit line.
Attorneys for U.S. Bank declined comment, as did a representative of Moyes, saying they could not speak to ongoing litigation.
In a smaller matter, Cessna Aircraft Co. has also filed a civil suit against Swift Aviation and Moyes. Cessna claims Swift and Aviation owes them $58,000.
An official familiar with the Cessna case said the matter could soon be settled. Cessna representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

Former Arizona Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes won a legal victory over the National Hockey League over financial losses after the team's 2009 bankruptcy.
The NHL had sued Moyes, who is the chairman and CEO of Phoenix-based Swift Transportation, seeking $145 million in damages in the wake of the Coyotes' Chapter 11 bankruptcy and ownership void that left the league running the franchise until 2013.

U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Redfield T. Baum recommended a federal court hearing the case rule in Moyes' favor and against the NHL which lost $112 million running the Glendale-based franchise from 2009 to 2013.
The NHL had also wanted Moyes to pay $6.5 million for the Coyotes' contract with former coach Wayne Gretzky.




Baum has been hearing the Coyotes Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, and the federal court hearing the NHL damages lawsuit had asked for his recommendation.
"This is a very significant court win for Jerry Moyes," said Steve Susman, the founder of Susman Godfrey LLP, the litigation firm representing Moyes.
A Phoenix attorney representing the NHL did not respond to a request for comment.

Mike Sunnucks writes about stocks and financial markets, real estate, government and sports business.

Jerry Moyes - Wikipedia





















 






Jerry Moyes

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Jerry Moyes is the founder, chairman and CEO of Phoenix-based Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States. Moyes is also owner of charter airline Swift Air. Moyes is also controlling owner of SME Steel Contractors Inc., a steel erector company based in Utah. He was a majority owner of the Phoenix Coyotes of the National Hockey League before the Coyotes filed bankruptcy and were sold to the NHL in 2009, and the Arizona Sting of the National Lacrosse League. Moyes is also a limited partner in the Arizona Diamondbacks, and was once a minority owner of the Phoenix Suns.
A graduate of Weber State College, Moyes is currently vice president at large of the American Trucking Association and previously served as president of the Arizona Motor Transport Association.
Near the end of 2016, Jerry announced he will retire at the end of the year. Richard Stocking currently holds the title of President and CEO of Swift Transportation.
Jerry and his wife Vickie have been married for over 39 years and have 10 children and 10 grandchildren.
Phoenix Coyotes[edit]
Moyes was originally a minority partner in Steve Ellman's ownership group, which bought the Coyotes from Richard Burke in 2001. On Sept. 26, 2006, Ellman sold controlling interest in the Coyotes, Arizona Sting, and the lease to Jobing.com Arena to Moyes. He retained Wayne Gretzky as part-owner and head of hockey operations.
Court filings show Moyes was never keen to own the Coyotes and had no interest in hockey. He acquired control of the club in 2006 after falling out over a real estate development with former business partner Steve Ellman. Afterwards, Moyes tried to find a buyer for the Coyotes, and he chafed at the league's interference in his attempts. In 2008, Moyes told Gary Bettman and other league officials that he would stop funding the club. The league agreed to provide emergency funding in return for Moyes turning over his voting control. The acrimony was made public in May 2009 when Bettman and Daly came close to selling the Coyotes to Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox, a move that would have seen Moyes receive almost nothing from the sale. On May 5, 2009, Moyes promptly put the Coyotes into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced a plan to sell the club to Jim Balsillie. Moyes also filed a lawsuit against the NHL, alleging the league was an “illegal cartel.” Bettman was furious, arguing the league had been blindsided and that Moyes did not have the authority to put the club into bankruptcy protection.[1]
Moyes was saddled with massive financial losses that dated to the time the former Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix. Unable to turn around the team's fiscal picture, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 5, 2009. As part of the filing, he agreed in principle to sell the Coyotes to a group headed by Research in Motion co-CEO Jim Balsillie, who intended to move the team to Hamilton, Ontario. The league responded by stripping Moyes of virtually all of his ownership authority, though he is still nominally the team's owner. The NHL argued that Moyes had no right to make the filing because numerous agreements he'd signed with the league in return for financial assistance specifically barred him from filing for bankruptcy. It also claims that Moyes effectively surrendered control of the team by signing the agreements. A bankruptcy judge has scheduled a hearing for May 19, 2009 to determine who actually controls the team.
In October 2009, Baum rejected the NHLs bid, as well as Balsillie's $242.5-million offer. The judge ruled that Balsillie's bid faced too many legal obstacles, however, he said the NHL could revise its bid to include concessions to Moyes and Gretzky. The NHL had originally taken the position that neither Moyes and Gretzky were legitimate creditors because they were owners. Under Chapter 11 proceedings, owners usually rank below other creditors and rarely receive any of the proceeds from asset sales. On November 2, 2009, Moyes officially sold the Coyotes to the NHL for $140 million.[2]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
