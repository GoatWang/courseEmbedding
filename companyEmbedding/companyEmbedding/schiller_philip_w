Early life and career[edit]
Schiller was born in Natick, Massachusetts, on June 8, 1960.[1] Schiller graduated from Boston College in 1982, with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology. He has held a variety of corporate positions such as Vice President of Macromedia, in San Francisco; Director of Product Marketing at FirePower Systems, Inc. of Menlo Park, California; Information Technology Manager at Nolan, Norton & Company of Lexington, Massachusetts; and a Programmer and Systems Analyst at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.[6] At Apple, Schiller worked in the formation and marketing of iMac, iBook, PowerBook G4, iPod, Mac OS X, and subsequent products. Schiller is credited with coming up with the idea for the original iPod's click wheel interface.[7]
Schiller frequently participated in a supporting role in keynote presentations given by Steve Jobs, usually presenting new products, like the iPhone and the iPad. During Steve Jobs's medical leave of absence, he presented numerous keynote presentations himself (with supporting segments by other Apple staff), including Apple's last appearance at IDG's Macworld trade show on January 6, 2009 and the WWDC keynote on June 8, 2009. Both presentations, held in San Francisco, were typically presented by Jobs himself. Among the things announced at these events were the updated MacBook Pro lines, the iPhone 3GS, new versions of the iLife and iWork suites as well as pricing and DRM changes to the iTunes Store. Schiller was the main person to host Apple events while the company was making the transition to Tim Cook assuming the role of CEO.
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2013, ExecReps ranked Phillip Schiller as the #1 CMO on ExecRank's Top Marketing Executive List.[8]

Apple 'Spends Millions Of Dollars On Ads That Don’t Even Run'

A $1.3 billion tech upstart struck a deal to 'leapfrog' competitors like Adobe and Oracle





There's now a ridiculous number of companies competing in the hottest area of ad tech





Ad tech can no longer handle all the ads available for sale




Apple launched a new corporate image campaign last night, a change of gear from the onslaught of product-specific ads it has relied on in recent years.
The tagline for the campaign is "Designed by Apple in California," and it is intended to reassure consumers that if they want beautiful products that work, Apple is it.
But Bloomberg's Peter Burrows just published a brutal analysis of the company's advertising under Philip W. Schiller, senior vice president of marketing.
Apple spends $1 billion a year on advertising, Bloomberg reports, but the company's ad agency, TBWA/Media Arts Lab can't get "clarity" about what Schiller wants. He shoots down their ideas, and spends millions of dollars on ads that never see the light of day.
In part this is not Apple, or Schiller's fault. The company has entered a period in which consumers openly question its dominance. Apple's products no longer sell themselves. Samsung and HTC both produce beautiful, capable phones that make Apple's iPhones look pedestrian.
Apple has lost its "groove," Bloomberg says. One example: It ran, and then swiftly cancelled, an ad campaign about Apple's genius Bar employees during the 2012 Olympics.
But it is this section of the story, which describes the inefficient way that Apple creates new ads, that ought to shock observers. Apple is still creating and canceling new ads after they have been made — a shocking level of waste that wouldn't be tolerated at a corporation that wasn't awash with $144 billion of cash on its balance sheet:
For years, Media Arts Lab executives, including James Vincent, traveled to Cupertino from Los Angeles most Wednesdays to discuss ideas and get [founder Steve] Jobs’s feedback, people said.Since his death, the meetings are run by Philip W. Schiller, senior vice president of marketing, which has meant less clarity about what the company wants its ads to say, people familiar with Apple’s advertising said.
Once Jobs had made a decision, no one at Media Arts Lab argued for long. Now, its creative staff becomes frustrated more often when Schiller shoots down ideas, they said.
... Media Arts Lab, created in 2006, goes to extraordinary lengths to keep its demanding customer happy. Apple spends millions of dollars on ads that don’t even run, people familiar with the matter said. Jobs said he couldn’t judge promising ideas based on sketches on poster-like storyboards, they said, so he had Media Arts Lab produce almost-ready TV ads, complete with music and celebrity voice-overs. That continues under Schiller, these people said.
Read the whole story here.

The Most Highly Paid CMO in the World: Apple's Philip Schiller
Computer Giant Gives Marketing Chief $60M to Stay Put for Five Years


	By  

Rupal Parekh.
	

	
	
 Published on November 08, 2011. 







Here's one way to know your company values your marketing acumen: It offers you $60 million to stay for five years. 




		Philip Schiller 
 	

That's precisely the carrot Apple is                now dangling in front of                Philip Schiller, its 50-year-old senior VP-worldwide product marketing, in the hopes of                preventing him from fleeing to a competitor. 



Mr. Schiller was among a small group of                senior Apple executives who were each recently granted 150,000 restricted stock units, valued at nearly $60 million, contingent on the them staying with the company for another five years. The company -- which is                in the early days of                operating under its new leader, Tim Cook -- is                clearly digging deep into its pockets in order to stem an exodus of                its senior-most talent in the wake of                the death of                Apple's founder, Steve Jobs. 



A veteran marketer with 25 years of                experience, Mr. Schiller is                a member of                Apple's executive team and has a big job: he's charged with overseeing the company's product-marketing and business-marketing programs and developer relations. 



He now reports to Apple CEO Mr. Cook, but was incredibly loyal to the departed Mr. Jobs. They worked alongside each other for years, and Mr. Schiller even appeared onstage at times for major product launches and demos. He even left Apple when Mr. Jobs did for a period, and rejoined when Mr. Jobs returned in 1997. Since then, he's been at the forefront of                developing and marketing products such as the iMac, MacBook, iPod, iPhone, Safari and Apple TV. 



Before Apple, he worked for Macromedia in San Francisco, FirePower Systems, Nolan Norton & Co. and Massachusetts General Hospital. Mr. Schiller wasn't always into computers, though. He studied biology at Boston College, and per his , it seems he still follows Boston sports teams -- the Red Sox, the Patriots, the Celtics and the Bruins. Beyond sports, he appears to be into science, cars (Porsches, Audis and Aston Martins) and rock music, including The Killers, Rush and The Dropkick Murphys.


According to ComputerWorld the share units will be awarded when they vest, and the shares will be worth their then-current price, which could be different than their current value. Half of                the shares vest in the summer of                2013, and then other half in the spring of                March 2016, assuming the executives are still with Apple at that                time. 



In addition to Mr. Schiller, others who were awarded the grants include Peter Oppenheimer, the company's chief financial officer, and senior VPs: Scott Forstall, head of                the iPhone software group; Bob Mansfield, who's in charge of                hardware engineering; and Jeffrey Williams, operations head who succeeded Mr. Cook in his previous role. 



So if the chief marketing officer at Apple is                worth over $60 million, how about Apple's CEO? 



ComputerWorld noted that                Mr. Cook has his options already; this summer, after taking succeeding Mr. Jobs when he stepped down, Apple awarded Mr. Cook one million shares that                vest in four years, and again 10 years, worth about $399 million at Monday's stock price.
