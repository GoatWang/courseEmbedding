Dining Room Supplies
Make your dining room perfect with our huge selection of tabletop and buffet items



        Dining room supplies have been part of the foodservicedirect product offering for over 15 years. We have cultivated great relationships with premier manufacturers such as Oneida and Libbey glassware. Our goal is to give the independent operator the largest possible selection of name brand items at amazingly competitive prices. Many food service suppliers offered dining room supplies only as an add-on, however, at foodservicedirect, we stock many thousands of these items and they have always been at the core of our offering.

Bar Supplies
All of the tools and supplies that professional bartenders need



        Bar supplies are an important part of our product offering at foodservicedirect. Finding quality products in this segment can be tricky, as many manufacturers of bar supplies are smaller and do not produce other food service items. For almost 20 years we have worked to fine tune our bar supply offering, we hope you'll enjoy our broad selection and competitive prices.

"I am very pleased with my order.  I was glad that I was able to purchase this from you online.  The price of the product and the shipping was very reasonable.  I used to be able to purchase this marinade at the local grocery store in Chicago but for some reason they do not carry this anymore.  Thanks again for making our skirt steaks delicious again!J.H.
