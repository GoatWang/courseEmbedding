Abstract
Strategic Planning is a function practiced by most public and private sector
organizations. Most managers are familiar with the concept of strategic planning and
associated processes. There has been some research in the field of management focusing
on the alternatives to strategic planning approach. "Management by groping along" is one
such approach. The "Management by groping along" strategy attempts to make an
organization capable of adapting, responding and, allocating resources and focusing
energies.
The purpose of this research was to empirically test the existence and viability of
an alternative planning strategy and to provide experimental results. Some of the outputs
of this research are: a set of indicators for the strategy "management by groping along"
and an analysis of the performance difference between "management by groping along"
and strategic planning approaches.
