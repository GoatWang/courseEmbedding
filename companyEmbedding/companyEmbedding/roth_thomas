Help address your complexion concerns with Peter Thomas Roth skin care products at QVC. Having struggled with his own skin challenges, Peter Thomas Roth knew how difficult it was to find effective treatments and developed an uncanny knack for sensing what kind of products consumers wanted.

Although the Peter Thomas Roth brand officially launched over 20 years ago, the true beginnings of the Peter Thomas Roth story date back much farther than that. Peter Thomas Roth, the man, has been surrounded and immersed in the world of skincare since his birth. A child of two Hungarian parents that owned spa resorts in his home country of Hungary, skincare was something that was just part of Peter Thomas Roth’s life. As he grew, skincare continued to play an integral role in his life until 1993 when Peter Thomas Roth finally launched his namesake skincare line. Infused with traditional Hungarian practices and blended with advanced cosmetic science, the Peter Thomas Roth brand seeks to provide people with truly effective skincare that delivers results.

Today the Peter Thomas Roth skincare collection consists of over 100 high performing products that are sold around the world.Popular Peter Thomas Roth ProductsPeter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM: One of the most widely known and used products of the Peter Thomas Roth skincare line is the Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM. This powerful overnight anti-aging serum is designed to promote skin cell renewal and reduce the signs of age. The secret behind the Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM is a formulation that contains a high concentration of retinol which is a widely used anti-aging ingredient.

This deluxe mask is designed to help firm and lift the skin leaving behind a bright and radiant glow.

There are some users who report noticeably brighter more radiant skin while others seem to experience little to no effect at all. Typically users note that the mask is too goopy and doesn’t absorb into the skin which is one of the most common Peter Thomas Roth reviews in opposition of the gold mask. As for common Peter Thomas Roth reviews in favor of the 24K Gold mask, many note that the morning after using the mask skin is noticeably plumper and more radiant.And our #1 recommendation in 2017 is Advanced Dermatology.

Lily AshleyI’ve used Peter Roth for about a year…using the retinal pads, liquid serum at night along with Reverstrol from skinceuticals. I’m over 70 and my skin is almost flawless. I’m a skin cancer survivor (3 times Moh’s on my face and lips!). So you can imagine I use sunscreen all of the time. But, I’ve been so happy with Peter Roth’s  products which I use at night. Perhaps skin cancer has made me more careful to clean, take care if my face, but the products do make a difference. I just went to an esthetician who said she found no areas to treat.

BONNIEI have been using the Peter Thomas Roth Un-wrinkle with snail +serum for about 6 years now and am almost 77 yrs ‘young”. I really feel the age stopping process and my friends as well say I “cannot” believe your that age girl! A few drops am and pm with reg common sense skin cleansing and care can help you too! Highly recommend it.

Samantha UrnessI am, and have been a big fan of PeterThomasRoth for many years…yesterday, I was out of town and needed a small size of the un-wrinkle peel pads, bought the small trial, and when I opened it at the hotel, I was disgusted. The protective foil on the top was discolored and looked very old…figuring it was just the packaging, I opened it:( YUK!! All the peel pads are yellow and old looking….not sure if I take it back to the store or throw them out…either way, I was very disappointed.
I love the products, but I guess I need to open every container now before purchase??…..

D. Lee GrahamJust recently stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian on Oahu and after trying the Mega-Rich Body Lotion, I want to lather it all over my aging body!  My hands have never felt so good!  Peter Thomas Roth, you are doing something right and I can’t wait to try your other products!  Thank you

JoeI am a 55 year of male and hey, I get it, at my age, I may not look like a million dollars  anymore when  I walk out the door, but hey, I am a solid one hundred dollars for sure. I just recently had an epiphany moment when I realized that every time I stayed at a Hilton Hotel my skin (from head to toe) was absolitely perfect, but then after a few days of being back home in the old routine I was back to dealing with problem skin. That is when finally came to the realization that it had everything to do the Peter Thomas Roth products provided by the Hilton Hotels. So, now I am sold and now I am on a mission. Thank you this moment of clarity!

MaggiI have always been a Peter Thomas Roth fan, their treatment serums have worked very well for me. I use 	Un-Wrinkle, Laser Free Resurfacer and De-Spot. I just started using FIRMx Growth Factor Extreme and I am sure I am going to be left very happy with this product. Great job Peter Thomas Roth.

RochelleI have used Peter Thomas Roth Retinon Fusion and FirmX Firming Night Moisturizer for years, and I look younger than most of my friends, although I do wear sunscreen religiously. My number one tip is to wear spf anytime you go near the sun.

MackenzieI discovered Peter Thomas Roth at the Hilton hotel as well. His conditioner is extremely good. I have frizzy hair and nothing works but I am looking at all the pictures from our holiday now and my hair is smooth. I would like to try his anti aging skin care products in the future.

JosyI am a big fan Peter Thomas Roth products. Not just his skin care but his shampoos and conditions as well. Very good products. Highly recommended.

SophiaThe only product I have tried of his is the Gentle Foaming Cleanser. It is a brilliant cleanser that is gentle yet effectively cleanses makeup off that is also fragrance-free. Though I also have to admit it is expensive comparably to other inexpensive cleansers that do a brilliant job as well.

	ABOUT PETER THOMAS ROTH

Peter Thomas Roth products originate from Peter’s own journey to find skincare products that really work. Having suffered with acne when younger – and more recently aging – Peter’s Hungarian heritage inspired him to use the many muds and minerals found in Hungarian thermal springs in his own range. Since 1993, Peter Thomas Roth has created products based on both natural minerals and 21st century skin care technologies to ensure his ranges really work.
Here at SkinStore, we are big fans of Peter Thomas Roth and his incredible range of skincare products; from the anti-aging properties of the Neuroliquid range to the famous Gold Hydra Gel Eye Mask, there really is something for everyone.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
