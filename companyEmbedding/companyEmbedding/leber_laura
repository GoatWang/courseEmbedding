                    "It’s thrilling to be part of a company from its early days and to witness a group of smart, passionate people bring a vision to reality, but it is a real privilege to be responsible for telling the world about it. The story of Oncotype DX and the power of personalized medicine is one that has captured a lot of attention. Our success in leading the clinical application of personalized medicine is a result of the commitment of the employees of Genomic Health who insisted on scientific and clinical rigor and on world-class customer support for physicians and patients. And it would not have happened if not for the brave heroes -- the breast, colon and prostate cancer patients -- whose stories shape, inform and inspire our work on a daily basis. And best of all, Genomic Health’s story has just begun!"



                Laura Leber has led the company’s efforts to tell Genomic Health’s story since 2002. In her current role as Chief Communications Officer, Laura is responsible for global communications to media, investor, advocate, government, patient and employee audiences. Prior to joining Genomic Health, Laura worked in various communications roles at Genentech, Inc., a leading biotechnology company, from 1992 until 2001, most recently as Vice President, Corporate Communications, where she was responsible for the company´s worldwide communications function. Before joining Genentech, Laura held various positions in Corporate Communications and Public Relations for Searle, a pharmaceutical company in Chicago, and at Fleishman-Hillard, Inc. in St. Louis and Hill and Knowlton, Inc. in New York City, both global public relations agencies. Laura holds a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Missouri, Columbia.
