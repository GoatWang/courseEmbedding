Chemical & Mining Co. Of Chile: An Oversold High-Yielding Stock - Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile Inc. (NYSE:SQM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Chemical & Mining Co. Of Chile: An Oversold High-Yielding StockJan.21.14 | About: Chemical & (SQM) Arie Goren Long only, value, research analyst, dividend investingPortfolio123Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile's (NYSE:SQM) stock lost about half of its value since the beginning of 2013, this compared to 28.9% rise of the S&P 500 index, and 39.0% rise of the Nasdaq Composite Index at the same period. In my opinion, SQM's stock is oversold, and it has plenty of room to go up. Furthermore, the very rich dividend (current yield at 4.70%) represents a gratifying income. In this article, I will show why I think that Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile's stock is a remarkably promising long-term investment.
The Company
Chemical & Mining Company of Chile Inc. engages in the production and distribution of specialty plant nutrients, iodine and its derivatives, lithium and its derivatives, potassium chloride and potassium sulfate, industrial chemicals, and other commodity fertilizers. The company sells its products through a distribution network in approximately 100 countries worldwide. Chemical & Mining Company of Chile Inc. was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Santiago, Chile.

Products
Specialty plant nutrition: SQM produces and sells four types of specialty plant nutrition in this line of business: potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium potassium nitrate, and specialty mixes.


Iodine: The company is a major producer of iodine at worldwide level. Iodine is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry, technology and nutrition. Additionally, iodine is used as X ray contrast media and polarizing film for LCD displays.

Lithium: the company's lithium is mainly used for manufacturing rechargeable batteries for cell phones, cameras and notebooks. Lithium is not only used for rechargeable batteries and in new technologies for vehicles propelled by electricity, but is also used in industrial applications to lower melting temperature and to help saving costs and energy.

Industrial Chemicals: Industrial chemicals are products used as supplies for a number of production processes. SQM participates in this line of business during more than 30 years producing sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, boric acid and potassium chloride. Industrial nitrates have increased their importance over the last few years due to their use as storage means for thermal energy at solar energy plants, which are widely used in countries such as Spain and the United States in their search for decreasing CO2 emissions.


Potassium: The potassium is a primary essential macro-nutrient, and even though it does not form part of the plant's structure, has a significant role for the developing of its basic functions, validating the quality of a crop, increasing post-crop life, improving the crop flavor, its amount in vitamins and its physical appearance. Within this business line, SQM has also potassium chlorate and potassium sulfate, both extracted from the salt layer located under the Salar de Atacama.

Operating segment disclosures as of September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012:
Total revenue for the first three quarters of 2013 was 1,710,930 thousand $US, the biggest segment was Specialty plant nutrients with 31.2% of the total revenue, the Potassium segment had 27.6% of revenue, and the Iodine and its derivatives had 21%.

Net income for the first three quarters of 2013 was 402,502 thousand $US, the Iodine and its derivatives contributed 30.9% to the net income, the Potassium segment contributed 20.4%, and the Specialty plant nutrients segment contributed 18.9%.

Valuation Metrics
The table below presents the valuation metrics of SQM, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.


SQM's valuation metrics are not particularly bad; the company has a low trailing P/E of 13.90 and the forward P/E is at 18.63, but the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is negative at -0.70%. The enterprise value to EBITDA ratio is quite low at 8.61, and the price to free cash flow is at 22.52. The total debt to equity is not unusually high at 0.77.
Most of the time SQM's trailing P/E has been much higher than the actual ratio, as shown in the chart below.

Dividend
Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1994. The forward annual dividend yield is very high at 4.70%, and the payout ratio is at 58.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 16.43% and over the past five years was at 4.66%.
SQM's dividend is paid twice a year in May and December, as shown in the charts below.



Latest Quarter Results
On November 19, 2013, SQM reported its third-quarter year 2013 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.06. The company reported net income of US$138.9 million (US$0.53 per ADR) compared to US$165.2 million (US$0.63 per ADR) for the third quarter of 2012. Gross Margin for the third quarter of 2013 reached US$148.5 million, a decrease compared to US$262.3 million for the third quarter of 2012. Revenues totaled US$521.1 million, a decrease of approximately 15.3% compared to US$615.3 million for the third quarter of 2012.
In the report, Patricio Contesse, SQM's Chief Executive Officer, stated:
Our third quarter results were impacted by recent uncertainty in the potassium chloride market. There are various reports and information available today regarding the potash market. These reports include both positive and negative information, which has in turn led to uncertainty relating to short-term potassium chloride pricing. We continue to believe that market demand is the most important indicator when assessing the potash market, and we are confident that total demand levels for 2014 will surpass the levels reached in 2013. Our total production cost of potassium chloride is well below the market price.
Next Quarter Results
Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile will report its fourth-quarter year 2013 financial results on March 01. SQM is expected to post a profit of $0.33 a share, a $0.21 decline from the company's actual earnings for the same quarter a year ago.
Competitors and Group Comparison
According to SQM, it accounted for less than 3% of global sales of potassium chloride in 2012. Principal producers in the market were Uralkali Group (OTC: OTC:URALL), which accounted for approximately 18% of global sales, Potash (NYSE:POT) and Belaruskali, which each accounted for approximately 16% of global sales, and Mosaic, (NYSE:MOS) which accounted for approximately 15% of global sales. Among SQM's competitors in the worldwide fertilizer products marketing are CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) and Agrium Inc. (NYSE:AGU). SQM is the world's main producer of lithium accounting for about 35% of the world lithium production its main competitors in the lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide businesses are Talison Lithium and FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC).

Technical Analysis
Personally, I am using only fundamental analysis for my investment decisions. After many years of experience, and after having tried all kinds of decisions making including technical analysis, I have reached the conclusion that relying on fundamental information is giving me the highest return. Nevertheless, some investors are successfully using technical analysis to find the proper moment to start an investment (I am not talking about traders, my analysis is only for investors). The charts below give some technical analysis information.

Chart: finviz.com
The SQM stock price is 11.59% above its 20-day simple moving average, 13.23% above its 50-day simple moving average and 15.17% below its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a strong short-term and mid-term uptrend and a long-term downtrend.

Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.
The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.91 and ascending, which is quite bullish (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). Furthermore, a trendline crossover was identified at the end of 2013. The RSI oscillator is at 45.62, after being at oversold area during the most of 2013, which is an extremely bullish signal.
Discussion
Potassium market
Potassium sales contributed 27.6% to SQM's total revenue for the first three quarters of 2013 and to 20.4% of its net income. Stocks of main potash producers jumped on January 14, as researchers Fertecon Ltd. and Argus FMB Potash said that Uralkali, the world's largest potash producer, seeks to raise prices for Brazil and China. According to Bloomberg news, Uralkali Trading, the potash producer's trading arm, wants $350 per ton for granular potash available in March from the largest Brazilian buyers. That's an increase of as much as $40 per ton, according to the researcher. The company is also seeking $330 per ton for the first half from China.

In July 2013, Russia's Uralkali quit the partnership with Belarusian Potash Co. (BPC), which together with a rival North American cartel controlled some 70 percent of the market. As a result, fertilizer stocks plummeted on fears that the Russia-Belarus potash dispute would flood the market with cheap potash.
Potash market fundamentals are improving, with low inventories and prices stabilizing: Global potash inventories have declined almost 20% y/y in 2013 and in every region except India. Potash prices have stabilized in most major markets following the weakness in the late summer/fall and Uralkali expects Chinese contracts (late December or early 2014) to set a floor for the market.
Global potash production is expected to grow in the years 2014-2020, due to world population growth and farmer economics and yield optimization, as shown in the chart below.

SQM is expanding its potassium-based products; its Installed capacity was approximately 2 million MT in 2012, and its effective capacity is expected to be approximately 2.3 million MT by the end of 2014. According to the company, Internal development of production technologies has allowed for a better utilization of natural resources and for higher yields through increased efficiencies. SQM is the only company that produces the three main products of potassium that exist in market today.
Lithium
SQM is the world's largest producer of lithium, accounting for about 35% of the global lithium market. Lithium is considered the oil of the future due to its use to power electric vehicles. Total production of electric cars using lithium-ion batteries is expected to reach 1.5-3.0 million in 2015 and 5.0-10.0 million in 2020. Tesla Motors lithium-ion battery packs are not just powering its electric cars any more. They have started appearing in a small number of California homes to store electricity generated by rooftop solar panels, and beginning last December SolarCity (SCTY), the Silicon Valley solar installer, started providing Tesla (TESLA) batteries for businesses that want to cut their utility bills. Lithium-ion batteries are common in consumer electronics. They are one of the most popular types of rechargeable battery for portable electronics, the kind that powers our laptops, tablets and mobile phones, with one of the best energy densities. Hybrid cars are getting more and more popular, lithium-ion battery powers the hybrid Chevrolet Volt car allowing it to run for 40-mile (64.3-kilometer) stretches entirely off of the battery.

Iodine
SQM is the world's largest producer of Iodine, accounting for about 35% of the global Iodine market. The compound annual growth rate of the global demand for Iodine products between years 2002 to 2012 was 4%. Since approximately 40% of uses of Iodine are related to human health and nutrition, this percentage is expected to increase.
Specialty plant nutrition
SQM produces four principal types of specialty plant nutrients: potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium potassium nitrate, and specialty blends. SQM is the global largest producer of potassium nitrate with 46% world market share. Potassium nitrate is one of the most important products in this business line.
The advantages of SQM products, plus customized specialty blends that meet specific needs along with agronomic service provided, allow SQM to create plant nutrition solutions that add value to crops through higher yields and better quality production. Because their products are derived from natural nitrate compounds or natural potassium brines, they have certain advantages over synthetically produced fertilizers, including the presence of certain beneficial trace elements, which makes them more attractive to customers who prefer products of natural origin. As a result, specialty plant nutrition products are sold at a premium price compared to other commodity fertilizers.
Conclusion
One of the reasons for the big drop in SQM's stock price, along with its peers, was the July 2013, move by Russia's Uralkali to quit the partnership with Belarusian Potash. This caused fears that the Russia-Belarus potash dispute would flood the market with cheap potash. But, Potash market fundamentals are improving, with low inventories and prices stabilizing: Global potash inventories have declined almost 20% y/y in 2013 in every region except India. SQM, as a low cost producer, will profit from the increasing demand.

As the world's leading producer of lithium Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile will benefit from the increasing demand for electric cars and mobile electronics devices, which are powered by lithium-ion batteries.
SQM has solid financial position, its margins and return on capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median. The company is focused on long-term growth.
SQM has low-cost structure due to operational synergies. Similar processes and industrial technologies are used across its operations: solar ponds, evaporation, salt harvesting, crystallizing and drying, among others.
Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1994. The forward annual dividend yield is very high at 4.70%, and the payout ratio is only 58.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 16.43% and over the past five years was at 4.66%. I consider that besides dividend yield, the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividend-seeking investors, and SQM's performance has been quite impressive in this respect.
All these factors bring me to the conclusion that SQM stock is a smart long-term investment.
Risk
According to Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile, the markets in which the company operates are unpredictable, are exposed to significant variations in supply and demand, and have volatile prices. Additionally, the supply of certain fertilizers or chemical products, including certain products, which the company trades, vary mainly depending on the production of the top producers and their respective business strategies. These factors can lead to significant impacts on sale volumes of its products, the financial situation of the company and its share price. In addition, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be affected by changes in policies of the Chilean government, other political developments in or affecting Chile, and regulatory and legal changes or administrative practices of Chilean authorities, over which the company has no control.

Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile (SQM) Stock Is Down Today After 3 Board Members Resign






Lindsay Ingram



Mar 18, 2015 11:53 AM EDT













 




























































 NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile (SQM) were falling 28.2% to $15.87 with heavy trading volume Wednesday following a report that three of the chemical company's board representatives have resigned. The three board members from Canadian fertilizer company Potash (POT) resigned amidst a campaign financing scandal, according to Reuters. Potash CFO and SQM Vice Chairman Wayne Brownlee and directors Jose Maria Eyzqguirre and Alejandro Montero did not give reasons for their resignations. Chilean authorities are currently investigating whether money from SQM and other companies in the country were siphoned to fund political campaigns. The investigation is largely concerned with money being siphoned to the right-wing UDI party, which has connections to the 1973-1990 Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. SQM fired its CEO on Monday due to the investigation and said it will comply with demands to hand its tax information to the Chilean government's internal revenue service. About 3.4 million shares of SQM were traded by 11:48 a.m. Wednesday, above the average trading volume of about 383,000 shares a day. TheStreet Ratings team rates SOC QUIMICA Y MINERA DE CHI as a Hold with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: "We rate SOC QUIMICA Y MINERA DE CHI (SQM) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed -- some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including disappointing return on equity and a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself."

The Risks For Chemical & Mining Co. Of Chile Outweigh Potential Returns At Current Prices - Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile Inc. (NYSE:SQM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Risks For Chemical & Mining Co. Of Chile Outweigh Potential Returns At Current PricesSep. 3.15 | About: Chemical & (SQM) Sven Carlin Growth at reasonable price, long-term horizon, book author, Fund ManagerGlobalgrowthstocksSummaryMarket outlook for SQM's products is bleak.Political issues and arbitrage court decision pending could have a severe impact on revenues.The current price is too high to give an investing margin of safety.Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile Inc. (NYSE: SQM) is a company that came up when I ran a screen a few months ago. The P/E ratio then was lower than the current, but I still want to see if there is potential in the company or not. In this article, I will present my findings about the company and its stock. I will start with a segmented analysis of SQM's businesses followed by the analysis of its business environment, a fundamental analysis and will close with a conclusion where I will state my opinion about investing in SQM.
Introduction and about SQM
SQM is a global company that produces specialty plant nutrition, iodine and derivatives, lithium and derivatives, industrial chemicals and potassium. The company has global diversified sales with no customer representing more than 3% of sales. Figure 1 shows SQM's global sales diversification.
Figure 1.

Source: SQM's investor relations
The global diversification means that SQM's revenues depend on movements on global markets and global prices for its products. To make a better analysis, it is necessary to first segment the business to its core products. The revenue from the various segments for the first two quarters of this year is as follows:
Figure 2. Revenue segmentation for SQM


Source: SQM's investor relations
The sales are global but the production is domestic and SQM is mining the natural resources available in Chile, mostly mining mineral deposits in Northern Chile.
SQM is quite diversified, so to get a clear valuation, I will first analyze the individual segments and then combine the value to get a clear valuation. The next few chapters are dedicated to a segmented analysis of the business.
Specialty Plant and Nutrition
From the caliche ore deposits, SQM produces nitrate-based products for specialty plant nutrients (fertilizers). By volume, SQM's sales make 46% of the global potassium nitrate sales. As fertilizers are affected by substitute goods, SQM is under the influence of the general fertilizer commodity bear market. Figure 3 shows the price movement for fertilizers in the last 5 years.
Figure 3. Fertilizer prices from 2011 to 2015.

Source: YCharts
Current trailing plant and nutrition revenues are $664 million, 11% down in relation to 2014. The fall in revenues is closely correlated to the fall in fertilizer prices.
A positive thing for the future is that fertilizer demand is steadily growing (figure 4).
Figure 4. Current and expected fertilizer demand

Source: FAO
But unfortunately for SQM, competition in the global fertilizer market is fierce. FAO estimates for 2014 to 2018 are that potash demand is going to increase by 2.6% a year and supply by 4.2% a year, phosphate demand is going to increase by 2.3% and supply by 2.7%, and nitrogen demand is going to increase by 1.4% and supply by 3.7%.

This data shows that we cannot expect higher fertilizer prices because of the higher proportional increase in supply than in demand. It will be difficult for SQM to achieve better results in this segment. As a neutral estimation, I will decrease the current earnings from the plant and nutrition segment by 10% a year for the next 4 years. This gives us EPS for the plant and nutrition segment of $0.37 for 2015, $0.33 for 2016, $0.30 for 2017 and $0.27 for 2018. Extraordinary events could push fertilizer prices higher, but those are temporary events. The general outlook is not positive.
Iodine and derivatives
Iodine prices are currently at around $29/kg. This is a huge slump in relation to the prices achieved in 2011 of $97.5/kg. The peak in 2011 was due to the earthquake and Fukushima disaster that hit Japan. Before that disaster, prices were around $32/kg in 2010.
SQM, unfortunately, anticipates a continuation of iodine price declines through 2015. As Chile accounts for more than 66% of world iodine production, and Chilean producers have announced production reductions, I will assume that iodine prices will increase in the future or remain stable. As iodine accounted for 15% of profits in the first half of 2015 resulting in $0.17 of EPS, I will assume that due to the possible production reductions, iodine earnings will not go lower in the long term and will possibly grow in the future. As a cautious estimate, I will keep the iodine EPS stable at $0.17 for the next four years.
Lithium and derivatives
Lithium is currently the hot commodity for SQM. With Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) building the Gigafactory and its expected launch in 2017, and general demand for electric cars also growing, the demand for lithium is supposed to grow. Goldman Sachs expects that lithium demand will grow about 6% a year, but prices are expected to remain flat due to increased production. The current situation on lithium markets is in oversupply, but the oversupply is supposed to decline when the Gigafactory and general electric car production increases.

Current SQM's EPS from lithium and derivatives are at $0.27. With possible market toughness for lithium, and SQM being a historical producer that produces at low cost and was producing lithium before the batteries - Gigafactory craze, SQM could highly benefit from this segment.
The future of electric cars could create a fourfold increase in demand, and with a cautious estimate that lithium prices could double in the future, revenues for SQM would jump from the current $100 million to at least $200 million, increasing EPS related to the extra $100 million revenue by $0.38. The total EPS for the lithium segment would then be $0.65 a year. With a tougher lithium market, this number could also be higher as we approach 2020, but that is still a long way to go, thus a lot of uncertainties and risks are involved in the lithium play.
A warning must be issued here that if lithium prices go up, electric car prices would also go up, and consequently demand for them would fall, bringing lithium prices down. Because of the possible volatility in demand for lithium, I will keep a cautious estimation of $0.65 EPS for the SQM lithium segment that could be reached in the next 5 years.
Potassium derivatives
The main SQM products are potassium chloride and potassium sulphate. Potassium prices are also decreasing, but EPS from the segment are at $0.30. Figure 5 shows that after the common spike for commodities in the 2008 period and the rebound in 2011, potassium prices are at multi-year lows.
Figure 5. Potassium chloride prices from 2000 to 2015

Source: Indexmundi
The outlook does not seem rosy for potassium as governments try to keep prices low and BHP Billiton Limited (NYSE:BHP) has the potential to develop its Jansen potash project, bringing much more supply to market if prices increase.

As the chart shows that prices might stabilize and the BHP project is not expected in this decade, I will keep the $0.30 EPS stable for potassium for the next few years.
Industrial Chemicals
The main product with industrial chemicals is solar salt, but it brings only 6% of revenues and profits, thus I will not make any estimations but just keep the $0.07 EPS from this segment.
Business environment
SQM operates in Chile, and except for global sales, is dependable on Chilean law. The current corporate tax in Chile is 22.5% for SQM and is going to be gradually increased to 27% in 2018. This increase will affect SQM with $53.2 million in deferred taxes costs that is $0.2 per share to be distributed into the next four years. With the current trailing EPS of $1.14, we should deduct $0.05 per share for the deferred taxes and take away another 4% from the earnings due to the future increase in taxes.
In March, three SQM board members resigned over disputes on how to handle charges of bribery to political parties. SQM also fired its CEO in March because of his refusal to cooperate with the investigation. The company has identified suspicious payments of $13 million without sufficient supporting tax documentation.
Another business issue and potential bad news is the disagreement with the Chilean Production Development Corporation (CORFO) where CORFO sued SQM stating that SQM has not fully paid quarterly revenues from 2009 onwards for the lease of an area that covers about 140,000 hectares of the Salar de Atacama where SQM mines lithium. Currently, the process is going through arbitrage, and a decision from the judge can be expected next year. The possible outcomes are that SQM can lose the lease for its lithium mining and has to pay restitution of damages from 2009 to 2015. Given the bribery issues and bad public opinion that SQM has at the moment in Chile, I do not see such a decision as an unlikely outcome.
Another risk that an investor must not forget when investing in Chile is that Chile is located in a seismically-active region and potential earthquakes and tsunamis might disrupt production and exports.

The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (NYSE: POT) owns about 32% of SQM and is trying to sell its stake in SQM. The CEO of POT announced the sale in May, but the fact that there have been no developments or offers up till now shows that the business risks related to SQM are important and that no big companies are ready to pay the asked price.
Fundamental analysis
Book value per share is $8.65 and the current P/E ratio is 17.83. The debt-to-assets ratio is around 0.5 and the company has enough current assets to cover all its liabilities. Revenue per share amounts to $7.10. The current dividend yield is at 3.66%.
Conclusion and opinion
The following table shows the combined conservative estimates for SQM's earnings in the next five years.
Table 1. Estimates for SQM's EPS from 2015 to 2019.

Source: Own calculations
If we relate the estimates to the current stock price of $15.42, the company might be correctly valued at current prices and expected earnings. But accounting for the potential risks like losing the lithium mining licence with bribery charges adding fuel to the fire, the ever-present seismic risk, and the commodities bear market likely to still be far from its bottom, I would not invest in SQM at current prices. A price that would give me a relatively large margin of safety would be one around the book value, thus around $8.65. This would give me limited downside because even with everything turning out bad for the company and EPS being around $0.7, it would give a P/E ratio of 12, where with a dividend yield of around 7% I could calmly wait for better news.
If things turn out well for SQM and commodity markets turn around, SQM could become again a star stock like it was in 2011 and 2012 when prices were around $60, but the potential risks and bleak commodity markets outlooks show that the risks outweigh the possible benefits. I am looking for better risk-reward ratios for my investments.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.

Benefits and AdvantagesWhere are liners used?Liner Construction & Fabrication




A tank liner is generally the quickest and best way to fix a leaking water tank, both steel and concrete vessels.
Tank liners are virtually maintenance-free.
Non bonded lining systems are quality quick-fixes that will extend the life of your existing tank.
Flexible tank linings can contain extremely corrosive and high temperature chemicals, acid or alkaline and waste fluids as well as water, water based products and gases.
You can have your tank back in service fast.
A tank lining is an integral part in a secondary containment system.
All our tank liners are custom manufactured to the shape, size and configuration of Your tank, pit, pond or secondary containment.
Preformed pond and cistern liners are available.

 
 

Our products are used in a wide range of applications as secondary containment lining, plating, chemical storage linings, ponds, water reservoirs and cisterns, clarifier tanks, trenches, swales, canals, gas recovery systems, membranes in pressure vessels, and many more applications.
Major companies like Boeing Aircraft, 3M, Chevron, GE and many other big companies are using our flexible drop-in linings.
Flexible lining systems are used in almost all industries where corrosion and/or contamination is a problem.
Flexible tank liners are a good and inexpensive solution for older leaking water tanks, water cisterns, water reservoirs and fertilizer tanks.
A flexible tank liner can be put in over lined, lead-lined or coated tanks as well as an old plating tank, lined or not. Little or no preparation is needed prior to the tank liner installation.
Tank linings are used in steel, plastic, wood, concrete or fiberglass tanks; old and new.

 
 

NSF/ANSI Std. 61 Potable drinking water grade materials are available in a wide range of thickness based on operational conditions.
Our flexible tank liners can hold a vast range of chemicals, from pH 0 – pH 14 and can withstand varying temperatures.
We have premium tank liner materials that are excellent in hard-chrome plating solutions.
The vinyl materials used in our drop-in liners are perfect for electroplating and anodizing tanks where insulators are needed to help prevent build-up.
For large tanks, pits and ponds our lining material can be pre-made in sections and then welded together on location.
All our PVC linings are made from only highest grade, first run, virgin materials, no fillers. There is a wide range of other materials available, based on your application.
Our PVC material is dielectrically welded, thus creating maximum tear strength and consistent material thickness over the seal. Other materials may take other manufacturing methods.
Full installation or only installation supervision of your tank liners is available by our OSHA confined-space certified personnel.
Stationary impact-plate protection may be necessary for the galvanizing and anodizing industries, where impact to the lining is a concern.
PVC and polyurethane membranes are used as inflatable containers in gas recovery systems and as pressure vessel bladders.

 
 
 
 
 
 



The most common way to secure a drop-in tank liner over the tank flange is with rope and grommets or sleeve & cord. This method may easily by modified to fit your tank; i.e., bolted batten strips or self tapping metal screws may be used. For a more secure fit with large, heavy duty liners, stainless steel clips are recommended.

Emergency Service
If your production is down due to a leaky tank, an emergency tank liner can be shipped in 24 hours or less. Most emergencies that are ordered by 10:00am can be shipped by 5:00pm at no additional cost.
From years of experience we have learned that Chromic Acid can be held by using a premium tank liner. By adding a double layer of material to the top 12″ – 24″ of the liner (the fluid/air interface), the tank liner can provide longer life expectancy.
Most tank liners are easy installed by your own personnel, or we can provide an installation supervisor and/or a full or partial crew as needed.
Research is on-going everyday because our goal is to have every tank lining last at least five years. If you think you have a problem that can’t be handled, ask. Solutions to many problems have already been found.
If you still don’t think it will work, tell us why and we’ll find a solution.
