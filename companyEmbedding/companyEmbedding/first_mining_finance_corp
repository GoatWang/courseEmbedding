First Mining Finance Is Building A Mineral Bank - First Mining Finance Corp. (OTCMKTS:FFMGF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»First Mining Finance Is Building A Mineral BankSep.25.15 | About: First Mining (FFMGF) Simple Digressions Contrarian, long/short equity, Deep ValueMarketplaceUnorthodox Mining InvestingSummaryFirst Mining is a small, niche company, building the so-called "Mineral Bank".
        The company is growing very fast, adding new exploration companies to its portfolio.
        In my opinion, the company's shares are undervalued at the moment.
        First Mining Finance Corp. (OTCQB:FFMGF) is a Canada-based, small company involved in building the so-called "Mineral Bank". It is not a gold or silver miner or the explorer. According to the company:
"Our business model is to acquire mineral assets, which are currently trading at very low valuations and holding or banking these assets until the capital markets for commodities and mining projects improve. At that point we would add value for our shareholders by entering into agreements with other parties, which would move the projects forward through exploration, development, and production while First Mining Finance holds a residual interest in the project in question. The residual interest may be in the form of royalties, metal streams, minority interests or equity positions in the counterparty that is moving the project forward. Ultimately our goal is to have a number of projects which are generating cash flow for our shareholders which we would remit to our shareholders in the form of a dividend."
In my opinion, First Mining offers a strategy, which might interest some precious metals investors. In this article I would like to give a short description of First Mining and, in the latter part, I am trying to assess the value of this company.
Introduction
First Mining emerged from a transaction involving Albion Petroleum and Sundance Minerals. Albion Petroleum was a company involved in the oil/gas and mineral industries, with oil and gas being dominant sectors. On July 1, 2014 Albion Petroleum entered into an arrangement, which totally changed its business. As a result of this arrangement:

Albion Petroleum changed its name into First Mining Finance
Sundance Minerals, a private company involved in precious metals exploration, gained control over First Mining
First Mining acquired mineral assets previously indirectly belonging to First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE:AG)
The new company changed its strategy, as described above.


New acquisitions
After its transformation, First Mining immediately started to implement its strategy of acquiring new properties/companies.
In July 2015 the company acquired Coastal Gold Corp (OTCPK:COGGF), a company holding the Hope Brook Gold Project (described below). This transaction was a non-cash one - First Mining acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Coastal Gold on the basis of 0.1625 common shares in the capital of First Mining for each Coastal Gold common share by way of a plan of arrangement.
Then, on September 1, 2015 the company announced its plan to acquire Gold Canyon Resources (OTCPK:GDCRF) and PC Gold (OTC:PCGLF). The companies control two prospective gold properties, called Springpole Gold and Pickle Crow, respectively. Although the transaction has to be yet approved by at least two thirds of the votes cast by shareholders of Gold Canyon and PC Gold, I assume that it will be successful. Therefore in the section on the First Mining properties I am giving a short description of flagship properties belonging to Gold Canyon and PC Gold.
Management
First Mining is managed by a few very experienced managers. The key persons are:
Chris Osterman - a geologist with thirty years' experience in exploration and metal production. According to the company's website, Mr. Osterman took part in the discovery and development of the San Jose silver deposit in Oaxaca, Mexico (owned by Fortuna Silver Mines) and the Zuun Mod molybdenum deposit in Mongolia (owned by Erdene Resource Development).
Keith Neumeyer - Chairman of the Board. He was the founding president of First Quantum Minerals, a big mining company producing copper, nickel, gold, zinc and platinum group elements. Apart from being the Chairman of First Mining, he is also the President and CEO of First Majestic Silver.
Apart from these two managers, the company is managed by a number of other experienced experts with precious metals background.
Properties
Currently the company holds a portfolio of 19 properties (excluding Springpole and Pickle Crow, which formally do not belong to First Mining yet). A number of other mineral properties are under review for a potential acquisition. All properties are located in three, safe and mining-friendly jurisdictions: Canada (one property), USA (one property) and Mexico (seventeen properties). The majority of these properties are under-explored, where practically no or very limited drilling was conducted. Therefore it is not easy to assess the potential of these resources. Fortunately, a few properties (listed below) are well explored and may be subject to further development in a substantially short time.

Note: although the acquisition of Gold Canyon and PC Gold are not completed yet, I assume that First Mining will succeed and the flagship properties belonging to these companies would be owned by First Mining. Therefore below I am giving a description of the Springpole and Pickle Crow deposits.
Hope Brook
Hope Brook is a gold deposit located on the southwest coast of the island of Newfoundland, Canada. The property was extensively explored by the former owner of the property, Coastal Gold Corp. (acquired by First Mining in July 2015). During five phases of exploration as many as 139 holes were drilled (39,321 meters of drilling). The last phase was completed in October 2013.
As a result, a technical report was prepared, where the Hope Brook mineral base was estimated to stand at 844,000 ounces of gold classified as indicated resources and 110,000 ounces of gold classified as inferred resources. Resources were calculated using the long term gold price of US$1,200 per ounce. Hope Brook is going to become an underground mine with the average recovery rate of 86%. But this is not the end of story. Most of the exploration work was focused on two zones of high-grade mineralization, called Mine Zone and 240 Zone but, according to the last technical report, the deposit is still open for additional exploration. Last but not least - between 1987 and 1997 Hope Brook was an active mine. Therefore there are 200,000 ounces of gold inventory, which could also increase the current resources and extend mine life.
Miranda
The Miranda Gold Property is located in the Sonora State in Mexico. There is a number of other mines operating in the area close to Miranda, for example La Herradura (belonging to Fresnillo plc), El Chanate (Alamos), San Francisco (Timmins Gold). Most of these mines lie in the so-called the Mojave - Sonora Megasheer, which is considered by some geologists (for example Chris Osterman, the CEO of First Mining) to be a mineral structure similar to the Nevada's Carlin-type deposits (those interested in that theory may refer to this article). It is why the company's management believes that Miranda could be a future gold-bearing deposit where an open pit mining could be conducted. Anyway, I think that Miranda, together with Hope Brook, is currently the First Mining's flagship property. At the moment there are no estimates of Miranda's mineral resources.

Springpole Gold Project
The Springpole Gold Project is located 110 kilometers northeast of Ontario, Canada. According to the last Preliminary Economic Assessment (published in May 2013), Springpole holds 4.41 million ounces of gold classified as indicated resources and 0.69 million ounces of gold classified as inferred resources. Springpole is planned to become a low-grade gold and silver bulk tonnage open pit mining operation with conventional milling methods. Although the PEA was based on mineral resources estimates (to get the bank financing, mineral reserves have to be established) so far this deposit is the best explored property in the company's portfolio. According to the PEA, during 11 years as many as 2.77 million ounces of gold will be extracted at Springpole. With initial capital expenditures of US$438 million, the project should bring the pre-tax net present value of US$579 million and the pre-tax internal rate of return of 25.4%, using the gold price of $1,300 per ounce.
Pickle Crow
Pickle Crow is located in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Between 1935 and 1966 Pickle Crow was an operating mine, where 1.45 million ounces of gold were extracted. Then the mine was closed.
In 2008 PC Gold started an exploration program at the property. As a result, in June 2011 a mineral resource estimate for the Pickle Crow deposit was prepared. According to that report, Pickle Crow holds 1,262 thousand ounces of gold classified as inferred resources (using the gold price of $1,100 per ounce).
Valuation
Most of the company's properties are in their early exploration stage, where no economically viable deposit has been established. What is more, in practice only a small number of exploration properties are going to become producing assets. It means that the market value of exploration properties is low, at least much lower than that attributed to the producing properties. How to value the shares of companies holding such assets? Well, there are a few methods of valuation, such as option agreement terms, appraised value, geosciences factor. But in the case of First Mining I will apply the method used by the company's management. In this method an enterprise value / resources multiple is being used as the main measure. Let me use this method to estimate the value of the First Mining shares. Then I will try to find whether the company's shares are under- or overvalued.

My assumptions:

Springpole and Pickle Crow are included into my estimates (though their acquisitions are not formally finished)
After the acquisition of Gold Canyon and PC Gold the company should have 289,724,863 shares outstanding (for simplicity, no warrants or options are included in my calculations)
At the end of June 2015, First Mining had US$3,692 thousand in cash and was holding debt of US$1,082 thousand
These days the shares of First Mining are trading at C$0.375 per share; assuming that the company will have 289.7 million shares outstanding, its market value is C$108,647 thousand (around US$81,485 thousand)
Therefore the company's enterprise value will be US$78,875 thousand (because the acquisition of Gold Canyon and PC Gold is a non-cash, no-debt transaction, no additional cash or debt is added or deducted in my calculations)
Of twenty one properties, only three have mineral resources established: Springpole, Pickle Crow and Hope Brook; these properties hold gold resources of 7,316,000 ounces (5,254,000 ounces classified as indicated resources and 2,062,000 ounces classified as inferred resources) combined.

With such assumptions, the company's enterprise value / resources multiple is standing at US$11.14 (C$14.85). Please, note that my calculations do not include a majority of the First Mining properties (18 deposits). Therefore the value of C$14.85 per ounce should be treated as a maximum. I am confident that the real value is much lower than that calculated above (for example, the addition of just one property, Miranda, should lower the value attributable to the company's mineral resources). Another point, one ounce of indicated resources is probably more valued than one ounce of inferred resources. In my calculations, to make them simple, I have made indicated and inferred resources equal to each other, which is generally a wrong assumption.
Summarizing - an investor buying the shares of First Mining would be owning a portfolio of mineral properties valued at less than US$11.14 per one ounce of gold resources.

Is it much or little? The chart below shows the market valuations of a few junior mining companies using an enterprise value / resources multiple:

source: NewCastle Gold presentation (page 10)
As the chart shows, the average enterprise value / resources multiple is standing at US$37 per ounce - it is much higher value than that attributable to First Mining.
Therefore I am quite confident that the current First Mining valuation is rather low than high. What is more, adding 19 properties, which are not included in my calculations, could deepen the company's shares undervaluation. That is why I think that First Mining should be worth keeping an eye on it, or even investing.
Summary
First Mining is a niche company in the precious metals sector. The company is in the process of building the so-called "Mineral Bank". Perceiving the today's sector valuations as very low, First Mining is going to build a large pool of mineral properties generating cash flow for the company's shareholders. Currently First Mining owns 19 properties but the company is trying to make two additional acquisitions, which could increase the number of properties by at least two well explored projects. First Mining is managed by a team of very experienced mining experts, which strengthens the company. In my opinion, the market value of the First Mining shares is relatively low at the moment, although it is not easy to assess specific value to the majority of properties owned by the company. Therefore I think that First Mining is, at least, worth of keeping an eye on, if not investing in.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report

First Mining has assembled a large and diversified portfolio including 25 projects with a combined gold resource base of 7 million ounces in the Measured and Indicated categories and 5 million ounces in the Inferred category. First Mining will add value to its assets through drilling, metallurgical studies, infrastructure improvement and economic studies.
