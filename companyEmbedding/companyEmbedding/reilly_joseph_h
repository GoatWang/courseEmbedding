 Obituary			



 Service Details
			




Joseph H. Bartel of Exton, died Wednesday, February, 25, 2014, at the Southeastern Veterans Center in Spring City.
Joe was survived by his wife of 38 years Lydia Bartel, sisters Krista Bohmann, Gerda Sehauseil, brother Horst Bartel, son Christopher Bartel, daughters Linda Fulton, Laura Vasko, Lisa Russo, grandchildren Eric, Janice, Brad, Eileen, Jesse, Michael, Jessica, and Natalie, and many great-grandchildren.
Joseph was preceded in death by his grandson Casey and great-grandson Mason.
Born in Ziegenhals Germany in 1930, son of Joseph and Katharina Bartel.
Joseph loved to play soccer, was a member of the Pathfinders (similar to Boy Scouts) and loved the outdoors. Joseph was 21 when he came to America on October 11, 1951, and would not see his family again for 40 years. One month after arrival in the US Joseph was drafted and honorably served 2 years on active duty in the US Army, stationed in Alaska, for which he received his US citizenship. Joseph was very proud to be an American, and a veteran.
Joseph enjoyed a long career in industrial plumbing, starting with the Long Island Water Authority and retiring as the proprietor of Pipe Line Inspection Company in Exton Pennsylvania.
Joseph was devoted to his family and will be greatly missed.
Relatives and friends are invited to his Funeral Service at 4:00pm on Saturday, February 28, 2015 at the DellaVecchia, Reilly, Smith & Boyd Funeral Home, Inc. 410 N. Church St., West Chester, PA 19380, 610-696-1181, www.DellaFH.com ; where visitation will begin at 3:00pm.
A Graveside Service will be held at 10:00am on Monday, March 2, 2015 at Philadelphia Memorial Park, 124 Phoenixville Pike, Frazer, PA 19355.
