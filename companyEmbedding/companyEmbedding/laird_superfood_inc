The result is a 100% organic coconut sugar – no fillers here – that has a lower glycemic index than typical sugar.

Aquamin - Derived from 100% red marine algae to deliver a rich source of readily bioavailable calcium. . 

Organic Red Palm Oil: One of nature’s most prized oils known for its naturally occurring nutrients such as antioxidants beta-carotene and vitamin E and the essential omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid.

Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil: Called the "King of Oils" Coconut Oil is extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts.  It has a unique combination of fats including medium chain triglycerides (MCT's).

MADE FROM A NUTRIENT-RICH FORMULA CONSISTING OF NATURE'S HEALTHIEST INGREDIENTS






AQUAMIN








COCONUT MILK POWDER








DRIED ORGANIC COCONUT NECTAR








ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN COCONUT OIL








ORGANIC RED PALM OIL








Made from freshly squeezed, filtered coconut milk to deliver the exotic flavor and aroma characteristic of fresh coconuts, non-GMO.
Made from the fresh sap of the coconut tree that is gently heated to produce a light nutty flavor that isn’t overly sweet along with a hint of coconut aroma. The result is a 100% organic coconut sugar – no fillers here – that has a lower glycemic index than typical sugar.
Derived from 100% red marine algae to deliver a rich source of readily bioavailable calcium.
One of nature’s most prized oils known for its naturally occurring nutrients such as antioxidants beta-carotene and vitamin E and the essential omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Sourced from organic crops that are sustainably grown in Ecuador, S. America not SE Asia, in partnership with Natural Habitats and Palm Done Right.
Called the "King of Oils" Coconut Oil is extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts.  It has a unique combination of fats including medium chain triglycerides (MCT's).

MADE FROM A NUTRIENT-RICH FORMULA CONSISTING OF NATURE'S HEALTHIEST INGREDIENTS






AQUAMIN








COCONUT MILK POWDER








DRIED ORGANIC COCONUT NECTAR








ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN COCONUT OIL








ORGANIC RED PALM OIL








Made from freshly squeezed, filtered coconut milk to deliver the exotic flavor and aroma characteristic of fresh coconuts, non-GMO.
Made from the fresh sap of the coconut tree that is gently heated to produce a light nutty flavor that isn’t overly sweet along with a hint of coconut aroma. The result is a 100% organic coconut sugar – no fillers here – that has a lower glycemic index than typical sugar.
Derived from 100% red marine algae to deliver a rich source of readily bioavailable calcium.
One of nature’s most prized oils known for its naturally occurring nutrients such as antioxidants beta-carotene and vitamin E and the essential omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Sourced from organic crops that are sustainably grown in Ecuador, S. America not SE Asia, in partnership with Natural Habitats and Palm Done Right.
Called the "King of Oils" Coconut Oil is extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts.  It has a unique combination of fats including medium chain triglycerides (MCT's).

Non-Dairy, non-GMO, Vegan, Gluten Free
(InstaFuel is a great value, besides being convenient and easy for on the go, a 1lb bag makes 42-6 oz. cups of coffee, that's only 52 cents per cup, for premium arabica coffee and our amazing Superfood Creamer combined!)
Note: Contains 50mg of caffeine per 10.7g serving.
Directions: Add 1 tablespoon of Instafuel to 6 oz of water and mix. Due to no additives this product may clump. Simply massage bag to break up contents before use.
Product will spoon mix easily, however if you want a frothed mixed latte effect, try our Hand Blender to mix right in your cup.
Ingredients: Coconut Milk Powder, Organic Coconut Sugar, Arabica Instant Coffee Powder, Aquamin™ (Calcium from Marine Algae), Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, Organic Red Palm Oil**.
Allergies: Contains: Tree Nuts (Coconut)
Mixing Tip: Only spoon mixes in hot liquids due to healthy oils, if wanting to make an iced coffee, we recommend first mixing into hot water then chilling with ice.
Try mixing the turmeric creamer, or other creamer with the instafuel for unique and delicious creamy combinations...
** Red Palm Oil sustainably harvested and grown in S. America (Non-Orangutan Habitat) in partnership with Natural Habitats and Palm Done Right.  For more info visit www.palmdoneright.com

About Us




Laird Hamilton: World renown big-wave surfer, fitness guru, coffee connoisseur.
As the world's most prolific big wave surfer, Laird Hamilton travels the world in search of the gnarliest waves and the most epic rides.  In order to succeed and to survive the occasional, lung-crushing 70-foot wall of water,  Laird needs razor-sharp focus, untapped energy, and exceptional endurance.
He gets all three from the power-packed ingredients he puts into every Laird Superfood product.
"These products provide the minerals and nutrients you need to sustain your energy and improve your performance," Laird said. "It's not just for extreme sports or for professional athletes like my wife, Gabby. They're designed for anyone who's looking to get a little more out of life... whether it's a friendly game of tennis or an exhausting day at the office or a great day of surfing."
Laird's inspired, "ah-ha moment" materialized when he was adding a scoop of butter to his morning cup of coffee. "Being a fan of the Ketogenic Diet, I recognized the need for healthy fats," Laird said. "And I absolutely love a good cup of coffee, so I started experimenting with different ways to combine the two. I knew there had to be a better way... better sweetener, better fat, better creamer, better nutrition.
The result is Laird Superfood Creamer, a non-dairy, GMO-free, gluten-free, vegan alternative to traditional creamers. Instead of butter, Laird's powdered creamer is a mix of healthy oils, coconut milk, coconut nectar and Aquamin, nature's best source of calcium. It's a tasty, nutrient-dense beverage booster that will transform your morning coffee into an important part of a healthy diet. (Click here for more nutritional info) 

Of course, you don't want to add innovative new creamer to a crummy old cup of coffee, so Laird scoured the world for the richest, most complex organic coffee.  He started with high-altitude, shade-grown beans from Peru that have very low acidity. Then he found a grower that employs a rare, wet-processing technique that eliminates the chance of contamination and flavor degradation. The beans are slow-roasted in small batches using a drum roaster and, finally, vacuum-sealed in an oxygen-free package. 

"I've tested coffee from hundreds of cultures on six continents, and one thing I learned is, it doesn't stay fresh for long," Laird said. "It starts losing its flavor and aroma almost immediately. That's why local roasters limit their distribution."
So far, Laird Superfood is the only coffee company that has solved the problem by using food-grade nitrogen packaging system.  Laird is not the only company that is using Nitro flush to solve the fresh problem.  They are the only ones doing it fully by removing 100% of the oxygen, where everyone else leaves 3.5% o2 in the bag which still will age the coffee rapidly.  Its another item where Laird takes the process to the extreme. That’s our mantra…:)   The result is a better, fresher-tasting cup every time.  And when you add Laird Superfood Creamer you have the perfect, performance-enhancing drink for whatever you're doing. (click here for  more on the growing, roasting and packaging of Laird Superfood Coffee)
Since Laird practically lives in the ocean he's extremely sensitive to environmental issues and sustainability.  Every ingredient is sourced from like-minded organizations like Palm Done Right and Natural Habitats, which adheres to the highest standards for palm oil farming and production. The Red Plam oil is sourced from Ecuador, not SE Asia and No deforestation, No farmer exploitation, No pollution or artificial processes whasoever.  By the summer of 2017 every Laird Superfood product will be certified organic.
“My biggest concern as a businessman – what keeps me up a night – is the consistency and quality of the products that are a reflection of who I am,” Laird says. "I need products that are authentic to who I am, and what I believe in… I believe in innovation and authenticity. I believe that the foods you eat should be as good for the earth as they are for you. And I believe that food should enable you to perform at the highest level, no matter what you're doing."

Grown on small organic family farms in Ecuador, the Red Palm Oil we source is certified Organic, Non-GMO and Fair Trade. We partner with Natural Habitats™ who ensures that no deforestation or habitat destruction results from the growing or harvesting process. 
Natural Habitats™ seeks to empower and support farmers. Committed to the sustainable production of organic and fairly traded products, they also contribute to social development in the community through education and nutrition programs, allocate a percentage of sales to social and environmental stewardship programs, have helped build small health clinics and provided sports uniforms for the local youth.  
The region in Ecuador where Natural Habitats™ Organic Red Palm Oil is grown supports numerous small family farms, averaging 10 hectares (about 25 acres), interspersed throughout the regional forests. These subsistence farms were planted many years ago and are now being worked by second and third generation farming families.  
Palm oil which is grown in Southeast Asia is associated with the stories of destruction of rainforests and the harming of orangutan habitats. Please note that orangutans do not live in Ecuador and Natural Habitats™ Organic Red Palm Oil does not contribute to deforestation or habitat destruction.

Good, organic coffee deserves better creamer.
Don't ruin a healthy cup of coffee with highly questionable creamer. With Laird Superfood Creamers you can sweeten, flavor and even fortify your coffee without using any artificial ingredients, ultra-pasteurized dairy products or additives of any kind.
This delicious new powdered creamer is a non-dairy, GMO-free, gluten-free, vegan alternative to traditional creamers. It contains nothing but Coconut Milk, Coconut Oil, Organic Red Palm Oil(Sourced from Palm Done Right and Natural Habitats sustainably in Ecuador), Organic Coconut Sugar and Aquamin, nature's best source of calcium. It's also loaded with naturally occurring MCTs — healthy fats that will help improve performance, no matter what you're doing.So cut the junk food out of your morning routine. Use Laird Superfood Creamer instead. There four varieties to choose from:

Original has a subtle coconut flavor.
Cacao turns regular coffee into a mocha delight.
Turmeric adds an anti-inflammatory dimension to our Superfood lineup.
Top Fuel is the concentrated, liquid version with butter for serious fuel for athletes and must be blended.

Top Fuel has a higher concentration of naturally occurring MCTs and must be blended into your coffee or smoothie. MCTs are quickly converted to fuel in your body, so Top Fuel is the choice for professional athletes like Laird Hamilton and his wife, Gabrielle Reece.
For an everyday coffee booster, we recommend Superfood Original or mocha.  Either way, you're getting a tasty, nutrient-dense beverage booster that will transform your morning habit into an important part of a healthy diet.

FAQ's


I see there are two Creamers the Powder Superfood Creamer and the Top Fuel Creamer, which Creamer is right for me?
Our Superfood Powder Creamer is a delicious creamer, Non-Dairy, Vegan, Non-Gmo, Gluten Free product that contains Coconut Milk, Coconut Oil, Red Palm Oil, Aquamin and Dried Coconut Tree Blossom Nectar to give is a light nutty flavor.  This contains MCT's and Aquamin, read more about Aquamin here...
The Top Fuel creamer comes in single serve packets in a liquid form and contains Dairy from Grass Fed Organic Butter, and the product is overall certified organic, Gluten Free, with no added sugar.  The Top Fuel has a higher concentration of MCT's naturally occurring from the whole food ingredients in the product.  MCT's cannot be stored as fat in the body but are used as fuel which may make it a better choice for athletes or people needing extra fuel.  It is recommended that this be blended into your coffee, tea or smoothies using a blender or our Laird Super Hand mixer.
 I see that the Powder Superfood Creamer contains Coconut Sugar, is it sweet?
There is some added Dried Coconut Tree Blossom Nectar in the Superfood Powder Creamers, but not the Top Fuel Creamer.  Coconut Sugar contains a variety of vitamins and minerals in itself and is verified Low Glycemic.  It does not necessarily make your coffee or tea sweet by adding it, but it does give it a delicious slight nutty flavor.
Coconut Sugar is considered one of the healthiest sugars available, you can read more about it here...

                            UPDATES 1


















At Laird Superfood, we’re putting a healthy new spin on the on the world's most popular pick-me-up beverage: coffee.
We have two successful product lines:
Superfood-enhanced coffee creamers and organic, Peruvian coffee. 
No other company offers coffee creamer that's packed with healthy fats and nature's best source of calcium. We are first to market in the enhanced creamer category. And our coffee is packaged in proprietary Nitro-packs, so it stays fresh 10 times longer than the leading brand. 


With Laird Superfood Creamers you can sweeten, flavor and even fortify your coffee without using any artificial ingredients, ultra-pasturized dairy products or additives of any kind. Laird Superfood Creamer is a non-dairy, GMO-free, gluten-free, vegan alternative to traditional creamers. It contains nothing but Coconut Milk, Coconut Oil, Organic Red Palm Oil(Sustainably Sourced with Natural Habitats in Ecuador), Organic Coconut Sugar and Aquamin, nature's best source of calcium. It's also loaded with naturally occurring MCTs — healthy fats that will help improve performance, plus 72 trace minerals that can enhance bone, joint, and digestive health.
 













Laird Superfood Founder Laird Hamilton is a world-renowned big-wave surfer. He has ridden the world’s most dangerous wave -- as tall as a seven-story building. He’s saved lives at sea (more than once) and he “shot” the Malibu pier during a storm. Laird co-invented paddleboarding and tow-in surfing and he invented the foil board -- an innovation that has the potential to change the future of big wave surfing. He's dubbed surfboarding’s “test pilot” by Surfer Magazine and “world’s greatest athlete” by The Washington Post.
He’s also a fitness guru and coffee connoisseur with a history as innovative and bold as his products.

In a sport that demands the highest level of physical fitness and mental focus to survive, Laird relies on premium coffee and superfoods to achieve peak performance.
He made it his own personal mission to better understand the process of growing, picking, roasting, and packaging high quality coffee. And in true Laird fashion, he also sought to naturally enhance his premium coffee by formulating his own superfood-based creamers.

Laird originally created his products as a physical and mental pre and post-workout boost for himself and his friends. As everyone continued asking where they could buy them, Laird decided to share with everyone the ingredients he’d used for years in his own coffee to give him his unique competitive edge. 













There are few daily routines more anticipated and celebrated than the morning coffee ritual. Coffee is one of the most widely-consumed beverages in the world. It is a staple at the breakfast table, on the morning commute, in the office, and just about everywhere in-between. 
Our mission is to make that ritual as healthy as it can possibly be.

Research conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health supports daily coffee-drinking benefits. The problem is, most people contminate their morning cup with creamers and sweeteners that are loaded with synthetic ingredients and a host of unhealthy additives that negate coffee’s inherent health benefits.
 













Current Product Line-Up:
Every Laird Superfood product delivers a convenient, delicious, and affordable addition to the morning cup, allowing health-conscious consumers to have their coffee, and drink it too.
Our "Hero" product is the first of its kind: A vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free coffee and beverage enhancer developed with a unique, nutrient-rich blend of nature’s healthiest ingredients: coconut milk powder, aquamin (mineral-rich calcified sea algae), organic coconut sugar, organic coconut oil, and organic red palm oil (sustainably sourced). This product is shelf stable for more than eight months without refrigeration, and contains no preservatives. Currently we have two varieties on sale and another ready to launch in the first quarter of 2017.

Laird Hamilton scoured the world for the richest, most complex organic coffee. He started with high-altitude, shade-grown Arabica beans from Peru that have very low acidity. Then he found a grower that employs a rare, wet-processing technique that eliminates the chance of contamination and flavor degradation. The beans are slow-roasted in small batches using a drum roaster and, finally, vacuum-sealed in an oxygen-free package. Our proprietary Nitrogen packaging system removes 100% of the oxygen from the bag, which means this coffee remains fresh for up to 12 months. Retailers love the extended shelf live, and customers appreciate a fresh-tasting cup every time.  
This highly-concentrated blend of our superfood creamer appeals to the health- conscious consumers and professional athletes. Single serve packs provide the right dosage every time, delivered in a gel/liquid form that blends into coffee, tea, cocoa or smoothies. This is Laird's go-to product for long-lasting energy from healthy fats, and is designed to bring the body into Ketosis; fat burning mode.
Sourced from the organic, dried nectar of coconut tree blossoms and renowned as the world’s healthiest sweetener. Our coconut sugar boasts a lower glycemic index than many other sweeteners and is high in magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and contains 12 of the essential B-vitamins essential for promoting many bodily functions.
A delicious combination of organic cocoa powder with our Superfood Creamer. Cocoa is said to contain a powerful antioxidant which may act as an antidepressant, lower LDL cholesterol, reduce the risk of blood clots, increase artery blood flow, lower high blood pressure, boost cognitive performance, and provide essential minerals such as calcium and potassium. 
The perfect delicious mix of premium 100% Arabica spray-dried instant coffee and our Original Superfood Creamer. Simply add hot water and enjoy. Perfect for when on the run, travelling, backpacking, camping, or for offices that only have access to hot water.
Made from stainless steel, our hand blender’s mechanical design and custom mix head quickly, cleanly, and easily blends our superfood creamers into your coffee, frothing and delivering a delicious cup of coffee in seconds.
 













Sales of Laird Superfoods products beganin June of 2016. The company was officially launched in September 2016 at the Natural Products Expo East trade show. Our Superfood Creamer received 3rd place in the Product of the Year competition, out of 1,500 exhibitors at Expo East.
Here’s what we’ve accomplished so far:
Validated Customer Demand  
We have sold over 54,000 units of product to date. Our monthly orders increased from 593 in June 2016 to 1,105 orders in November 2016.

Established a strong foothold on retail shelves.
Laird Superfood products are now for sale on store shelves in Oregon, California, Nevada, Texas, Michigan, Maryland, Florida and Hawaii, and the list is expanding every week. Our Superfood Creamer is often the first product that is picked-up by retail chains, but they also love our coffee for its extended shelf life.
Captured market share on key ecommerce sites.
Online sales through Thrive Market, Amazon.com, AzureStandard.com, LairdSuperfood.com and others sites are growing rapidly. 
Landed a nation-wide distribution deal. 
Our first distributor, Azure Standard, now sells our products to 55,000 consumers in 38 states. Their customers include end consumers as well as restaurants, bakeries, and independent health food stores.
Built a strong, grassroots following.
Our initial focus has been on building a grassroots following through direct sales to independent, natural food stores. This strategy has allowed us to quickly scale our manufacturing and easily manage supply chains.  
Signed a leading food brokerage.
Laird Superfood has just contracted with YinYang Naturals, a leading food broker in the U.S. This relationship will allow us to connect directly with major grocery chains. For example, we’re currently in the application auditing process with Whole Foods.
Protected our intellectual property.
The product formulas are the property of Laird Superfood. We are researching the viability of food patents and protection of these formulas.

About Laird Superfoods
Laird Hamilton: World renown big-wave surfer, fitness guru, coffee connoisseur.
As the world's most prolific big wave surfer, Laird Hamilton travels the world in search of the gnarliest waves and the most epic rides.  In order to succeed — and to survive the occasional, lung-crushing 70-foot wall of water — he needs razor-sharp focus, untapped energy, and exceptional endurance. He gets all three from the power-packed ingredients he puts into every Laird Superfood product.
"These products provide the minerals and nutrients you need to sustain your energy and improve your performance," Laird said. "It's not just for extreme sports or for professional athletes like my wife, Gabby. They're designed for anyone who's looking to get a little more out of life... whether it's a friendly game of tennis or an exhausting day at the office or a great day of surfing."
Laird's inspired, "ah-ha moment" materialized when he was adding a scoop of butter to his morning cup of coffee. "Being a fan of the Ketogenic Diet, I recognized the need for healthy fats," Laird said. "And I absolutely love a good cup of coffee, so I started experimenting with different ways to combine the two. I knew there had to be a better way... better sweetener, better fat, better creamer, better nutrition.

MAP - Minimum Advertised Price
Sometimes, manufacturers require that products be advertised at their "suggested" price, even placing restrictions on how that price is communicated to potential customers. Of course, we have the right to sell products for however much we want, and sometimes do choose to offer a product for lower than the minimum-advertised-price (ie, MAP). In these special cases, the manufacturer does not allow us to display the actual price until a customer initiates an action on their end. 
Still with us? 
Let’s skip right to the bottom line: You can always see an item’s actual sale price by clicking the "Add to Cart" button or the "See Price In Cart" link. Please be assured that simply adding an item to your cart does not obligate you to buy it. You can always change your mind and delete the item from your cart if you decide it’s not for you or the price is higher than you expected.

		Laird Superfood Launching in Sisters

The founder of GolfBoard is launching a new business in Central Oregon alongside business partner Laird Hamilton. Paul Hodge is the founder of GolfBoard which is based in Central Oregon and a popular product at golf courses around the country. Now Hodge and Hamilton have partnered to launch a new business in Sisters called Laird Superfood.
Laird Superfood offers organic coffee and a Superfood Creamer to provide a delicious and healthy twist to the daily coffee ritual. The product is manufactured in Sisters where Hodge has lived since 2011.
“I have wanted to build something locally in order to give job opportunities to our community. Doing a project that has this very large scale potential in such a small community has its challenges. However, we’re doing everything we can to try and keep it in Sisters,” Hodge said.
Laird Superfood is a result of Hamilton’s love for coffee combined with his career as a professional big wave surfer. Surfing big waves requires a high level of focus in order to maintain peak performance levels. Hamilton understood long ago that premium coffee was a natural and healthy solution to keep him performing at a world class level.
The company is beginning with coffee and intends to expand by offering a full line of healthy food products.
“We started with coffee because the coffee market is massive and can provide a gateway to coffee drinkers which may not be currently focused on nutrition. Laird had heard someone say that in many cases people’s diets are so out of whack that the coffee they consume in the morning is their healthiest meal of the day,” Hodge said.
Laird Superfood’s coffee uses a high-altitude, organic-certified, wet-processed, low-acid coffee bean that is grown in Peru. The company currently offers a sweetener, performance and energy blend and a coffee/creamer combo. Hamilton intends to continue expanding the product line of Superfood’s to provide healthier food and beverage products to the mass market.
Laird’s Superfood Creamer combines healthy fats based in MCT form with Aquamin. The healthy fats are paramount for a healthy diet and are the basis for what our brains consume as fuel.
“Recent research has proven that healthy fats are actually the key to losing weight and staying slim. The Aquamin ingredient is a calcified sea algae that grows only off the coasts of Iceland and Ireland. It’s a highly bio-available form of calcium which we all need as we age and it also contains 72 other minerals absorbed from the ocean water which you will be hard pressed to get any other way,” Hodge said.
Nearly 20 years ago Hamilton began incorporating coffee in his daily regimen and began adding healthy MCT fats as fuel for long surf days. He realized that carb loading burnt off too quickly and that healthy fat energy would last long enough to get through a day of surfing. He soon became a coffee connoisseur and created his own coffee, creamer and sweetenerusing natural whole food ingredients.
“Our coffee is organic and Laird scoured the earth for what he felt was the best organic coffee available. Our organic certification coffee is a low acid strain grown at high altitude creating an HB (hard bean) and SHB (strictly hard bean) class bean, and its wet processed to ensure the flesh doesn’t affect the taste as it dries, its then slow drum roasted for 20 minutes instead of flash roasted, then packaged in 99.9 percent pure food grade nitrogen which keeps it absolutely fresh roasted tasting for 6 months or longer,” Hodge said.
Laird Superfood products are currently offered on their website and the company is seeking resellers, distributors and wholesale opportunities.
“We have been selling the products online to Laird’s fans for about a year. We launch September 21 at the Natural Products Expo East show in Baltimore to retailers who we hope will want to provide this to their customers as one of the only healthy coffee creamer alternatives,” Hodge said.
Currently Laird Superfood products are being offered to Central Oregonian’s at Melvin’s in Sisters and Tetherow in Bend.
In preparation for the company launch Hamilton has released an online Crowdfunder which allows accredited investors to be co-owners in the project. The Crowdfunder can be found at this link: www.crowdfunder.com/laird-superfood.
The company has a small 506D equity offering open. It is for accredited investors and the total raise is $500,000. So far $330,000 is banked and another $90,000 is tentatively reserved but not yet received.
If accredited investors are interested they should contact Hodge directly at paul@lairdsuperfood.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
