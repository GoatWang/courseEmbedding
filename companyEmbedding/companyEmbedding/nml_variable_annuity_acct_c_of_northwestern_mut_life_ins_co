Variable Annuities with FlexChoice


.







Lifetime Income with Fewer Compromises
Market volatility and today’s long retirements make income you can’t outlive an essential part of your portfolio.
A variable annuity with the optional FlexChoice rider lets you turn a portion of your savings into guaranteed income that lasts for life. You’ll also benefit from market gains while being protected if the market drops. All that plus real-life flexibility to adapt however life unfolds — especially if you’re married. 






At-A-Glance:
 Variable Annuities 



One of the only investments that offer income for life — no matter how long you live.
Have the potential to grow tax-deferred with the market.
Optional living and death benefits offer added protection.


















Income Built for Two
			See why FlexChoice is a lifetime income option married couples may love.

Benefits
           Make your portfolio more balanced and durable with guaranteed lifetime income that can grow.
        



Income


Flexibility


On Your Terms













Income You Can Count On








Earn 5% Growth Per Year
During the first decade, your future income goes up by compounding 5% each year, even if the market goes down or stays flat (as long as you don’t withdraw anything).
Lock in Market Gains
Each year until age 91, if your account value is higher than your Benefit Base due to market performance, you get an Automatic Step-Up that increases future payments.
5% or 6% Withdrawals at Age 65
You can start taking 5% or 6% withdrawals at age 65 depending on your choice of two options.






 

















 

















Unique Flexibility for Married Couples








For However Life Unfolds
Many guaranteed income products make married couples lock in big decisions up front. But with FlexChoice, you don’t have to decide if you want income for one or two lives unless your account value runs out.
More Income Sooner
Unlike many retirement income products, with FlexChoice the amount of income you can withdraw is based on the age of the older owner. That can mean getting a higher withdrawal rate years sooner than if you had to wait for a younger spouse to “catch up.”
Income Built for Two
If a spouse passes away, the surviving spouse continues to receive the same income payments they’ve come to rely on with no interruption.






More about 
 Spousal Flexibility 


Wondering about the cost to cover two people? There’s no extra charge to cover a spouse, and married couples even enjoy the same initial withdrawal rate as single account holders.

Make Decisions When It is Right for You








Turn Withdrawals On and Off
You can start and stop withdrawals at any time after 59½. Waiting to take withdrawals can increase the amount you’re able to withdraw later.
Choose How Much You Get
The income you receive is based on factors you control. They include the age at which you start taking withdrawals, whether you want a steady amount of income or more early on, and if you decide to cover one or two people (only after your account value runs out).
Cancel if You Change Your Mind
In some cases, you may no longer need lifetime income. That’s ok — you have alternatives if your needs change.

Prospectuses for the investment portfolios offered by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company are available from your financial professional. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract’s features, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The investment objectives, risks, and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial variable annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions, and terms for keeping them in force. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in this product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value, even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. All contract and rider guarantees, including optional benefits and annuity payout rates, are subject to the claims paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Please contact your financial professional for complete details.
Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution tax that is generally imposed on interest, dividends, and annuity income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges.
Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. Clients should confer with their qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Life Insurance: Lasting Protection for What Matters Most


Life insurance can be more than a safety net. Depending on the type of life insurance, it also can be the foundation for a sound financial plan. 








« Back to Products & Services
More in Products & Services








Your family means everything to you.
That’s why you’ve worked hard to give your loved ones every advantage. But would your family have the financial resources to maintain its lifestyle if you died?
While nothing can replace you, life insurance can help ensure your loved ones have the financial security necessary to live out their dreams. Life insurance can help:
 

Pay the mortgage or any other debt you may have.
Maintain your family’s standard of living.
Keep your children in their current school and fund college.
Pay for final expenses.
Leave a legacy.

Life insurance can also be more than a safety net. Depending on the type of life insurance, it can also be the foundation for a sound financial strategy. With permanent life insurance, for example, as you pay premiums, the policy accumulates cash value that grows tax deferred and can become a source of funding you can utilize to help meet your financial goals.1 Learn more about each of the two main types of life insurance by clicking on the links below:








Permanent Life Insurance
Helps meet your protection needs throughout your lifetime and accumulate cash value. Learn More.



Term Life Insurance
Helps meet your protection needs for a specific number of years. Term life insurance includes an option to convert to permanent insurance in the future using the same health status as your term policy. Learn More.








Why Northwestern Mutual?


When buying life insurance, you want a strong company that will be there when you need it. You also want a company that provides superior value over time. Northwestern Mutual has been helping clients achieve financial security for nearly 160 years. Our company has lived through the Civil War, the Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, two world wars, and numerous recessions. Northwestern Mutual is strong. We have the highest financial strength ratings awarded to any life insurer by all four of the major credit rating agencies.2
Northwestern Mutual policyowners can also benefit from yearly dividends. While dividends are not guaranteed, Northwestern Mutual has paid one every year since 1872. In fact, Northwestern Mutual's total yearly dividend payout consistently leads the industry.3 That’s money you can use to increase the value of your policy, pay premiums or take as cash.

Northwestern Mutual Life to settle annuities suit for $84 million





March 16, 2015


0 Comments

By Bruce Vielmetti of the Journal Sentinel

March 16, 2015

Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. has agreed to pay $84 million to settle a long-running class action lawsuit over changes the company made to annuities it sold before 1985.
About 4,000 current and 29,000 former owners of the product will be eligible to share in the settlement of a case that could have carried a much higher price tag if a jury ultimately believed the plaintiffs' theory.
"This lawsuit was a case of a small group of customers seeking more than their fair share of dividends, which would have come at the expense of all our other policyowners," said Betsy Hoylman, director of public relations for Northwestern Mutual.
"We are proud of the significant dividends we have paid to this group over the years, and believe our actions have been right, fair and in the best interest of all of our policyowners, including these annuity owners."
Hoylman said the company decided it was in everyone's interest to avoid continued costs of litigation and the "uncertainty of the legal process."
George Kersten, one of the lead plaintiff lawyers, called the agreement "a fair resolution of a very complex case." He said it was especially beneficial "to the majority of class members in or approaching retirement."
The minimum award is $250, and others could be thousand of dollars, depending on the size of the annuities held and when they were held, based on a complex formula. Kersten said a national firm will administer the notice and claims processing for about $600,000, and the legal fees are capped at 35% of the $84 million.
The proposed settlement must still win final approval from U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman. That could happen by the end of summer.
A Fort Atkinson woman, Marleen LaPlant, contends that in 1985, Northwestern Mutual improperly changed the way it paid people who had purchased annuities from the company without notice to or permission from the buyers, resulting in their loss of dividend income over the next 20 years. The company says the change was a normal part of business.
The plaintiffs continued to receive what were called dividends, but contend that they were merely interest payments from short-term bonds into which the company had switched the annuity assets.
The original contracts, plaintiffs claim, called for annuity holders to share in a surplus generated by Northwestern Mutual's general portfolio — something that did extremely well in recent years, including a record $5.5 billion in dividends for 2014.
The clients were counting on the company's promise and reputation for long-term strength, their lawyer argued at an early trial in the case.
"They thought they would prosper as the company prospered," Kersten told a judge.
According to court records, the proposed settlement resulted from months of mediator-assisted negotiation.
Long-running case
The case took some dramatic turns through state and federal court before the settlement. A lengthy trial was held in 2010 in Milwaukee County Circuit Court before a retired Racine County judge who later ruled for the plaintiffs in a 97-page order that was highly critical of Northwestern Mutual.
Reserve Judge Dennis Flynn found the firm had breached contracts with the annuity holders, and also breached its fiduciary duty as well as duties of good faith, fair dealing and loyalty.
"Intentional and repeated concealment of wrongdoing over a period of a quarter century took place," Flynn wrote.
The decision stunned the company, which then tried to have Flynn removed from the case and all his decisions on the matter thrown out, claiming it had recently discovered Flynn himself briefly owned some of the annuities in question.
Flynn said he had no memory of the investments and suggested it was the defense lawyers' ethics that should be examined, for not bringing the issue up earlier.
Northwestern Mutual then moved the case to federal court after the plaintiffs tried to expand the class to annuity holders nationwide, not just those in Wisconsin. Adelman initially sent the case back to state court, but a federal appeals court sided with Northwestern Mutual in 2012.
A nearly identical lawsuit was filed against Northwestern Mutual six years earlier before LaPlant, in 2002, but got bogged down in its own furious litigation and never went to trial.
Another lawsuit pending
Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Daniel Noonan and his wife bought similar annuities. Their lawsuit came a couple months after Northwestern Mutual had announced a record-breaking dividend payout of $3.7 billion. The couple claimed the company had breached its contracts and its fiduciary duty to annuity holders.
According to the settlement records, the Noonan case remains pending in Wisconsin state court. Similar class action claims in other states would be part of the proposed settlement.

NML Variable Annuity Account C

Group Combination Annuity Contracts                                             
This prospectus describes group combination annuity contracts (the "Contracts") 
offered by The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company ("Northwestern
Mutual") for use in connection with plans and trusts meeting the requirements   
of Sections 401 or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
"Code"). Such plans, which are popularly called "HR-10 Plans", afford certain   
federal income tax benefits to self-employed individuals and to employees and   
their beneficiaries.                                                            

The Contracts provide for the accumulation of funds and the payment of          
retirement benefits to participants or their beneficiaries ("Annuitants"). You  
may accumulate funds on a variable or fixed or combination basis. We will pay   
retirement benefits in a lump sum or under a variable or fixed annuity payment  
plan. Annuity benefits are described in individual certificates issued to       
Annuitants.                                                                     

We fund variable accumulations and retirement benefits through NML Variable     
Annuity Account C (the "Account"), our separate account. This prospectus        
describes only the Account and the variable provisions of the Contracts except  
where there are specific references to the fixed provisions. The Account has    
twenty-four Divisions. You may direct how net considerations are allocated      
among the Divisions.                                                            

We use NML Variable Annuity Account C (the "Account") to keep the money you     
invest separate from our general assets. The money in the Account is invested   
in the eighteen portfolios of Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., the        
Fidelity Mid Cap Portfolio, and the five Russell Investment Funds. You select   
the Portfolios or Funds in which you want to invest. Northwestern Mutual Series

Real Estate Securities.                                                         

The Account has 24 Divisions that correspond to the 19 Portfolios and 5 Funds   
in which you may invest. The Contracts also permit you to invest on a fixed     
basis, at rates that we determine. This prospectus describes only the Account   
and the variable provisions of the Contracts except where there are specific    
references to the fixed provisions.                                             

We offer two versions of the Contracts: front-load Contracts and                
simplified-load Contracts. (See "Expense Table", p. 3, and "Deductions", p. 20.)

This prospectus is a concise description of the information you should know     
before you buy a Contract. We have filed additional information about the       
Contracts with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Statement of         
Additional Information. We incorporate the Statement of Additional Information  
into this prospectus by reference. We will send you the Statement of Additional 
Information without charge if you write to The Northwestern Mutual Life         
Insurance Company, 720 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53202, or   
call us at Telephone Number 1-888-455-2232. You will find the table of contents 
for the Statement of Additional Information following page 21 of this           
prospectus.                                                                     

This prospectus is valid only when accompanied by the current prospectuses for  
Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., the Fidelity VIP Mid Cap Portfolio and   
the Russell Investment Funds which are attached to this prospectus. You should  
retain this prospectus for future reference.

The following Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing   
in the Contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. 
These costs include Contract owner transaction expenses, Contract fees,         
separate account annual expenses, and fees and expenses for the Portfolios of   
Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., Fidelity VIP Mid Cap Portfolio and       
Russell Investment Funds (the "Portfolios and Funds"). The Examples assume that 
you invest $10,000 in the Contract for the time periods indicated. The Examples 
also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and assumes the      
maximum fees and expenses of any of the Portfolios and Funds as shown in the    
Table on page 4. Your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these       
assumptions.

Note: The purchase payments for either a Front-Load Contract or a               
Simplified-Load Contract must reach a total minimum amount of $25,000 during    
the first Contract year. The installation fee of $750 is divided between the    
funds for the Simplified-Load fee table. The numbers above must be multiplied   
by 2.5 to find the expenses for a Front-Load Contract or a Simplified-Load      
Contract of this minimum size.                                                  

The purpose of the table above is to assist you in understanding the expenses   
paid by the Account and the Portfolios and Funds borne by investors in the      
Contracts. The sales load for a front-load Contract depends on the amount of    
cumulative purchase payments. For both Contracts an annual administration fee   
of $150 applies if the Contract value is less than $25,000 on the Contract      
anniversary. The table does not include any expenses for premium taxes. We      
currently make no charges for premium taxes. See "Deductions", p. 20 for        
additional information about expenses for the Contracts. The expenses shown in  
the table for the Portfolios and Funds show the annual expenses for each, as a  
percentage of their average net assets, based on 2003 operations for the        
Portfolios and their predecessors and the Funds. Expenses for the T. Rowe Price 
Small Cap Value, International Growth, AllianceBernstein Mid Cap Value, Janus   
Capital Appreciation, Capital Guardian Domestic Equity, T. Rowe Price Equity    
Income and Asset Allocation Portfolios and for each of the Russell Investment   
Funds reflect fee waivers and expense reimbursements that the Portfolios' and   
Fund's advisers have voluntarily agreed to make for the year 2004. These may be 
changed in future years without notice. The expenses shown in the table reflect 
an assumption that the fee waivers and expense reimbursements will continue for 
the periods shown. Absent the fee waivers and expense reimbursements the        
expenses would be higher. See the disclosure on page 4.                         

The example should not be considered a representation of past or future         
expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown, subject to   
the guarantees of the Contracts.

NML Variable Annuity Account C                                                  

We established the Account on July 22, 1970 by action of our Board of Trustees  
in accordance with the provisions of the Wisconsin insurance law.               

The Account has twenty-four Divisions. The money you invest to provide variable 
benefits under your Contract is placed in one or more of the Divisions as you   
direct.                                                                         

Under Wisconsin law, the investment operations of the Account are kept separate 
from our other operations. The values for your Contract will not be affected by 
income, gains or losses for the rest of our business. The income, gains or      
losses, realized or unrealized, for the assets we place in the Account for your 
Contract will determine the value of your Contract benefits and will not affect 
the rest of our business. The assets in the Account are reserved for you and    
other Contract owners, although the assets belong to us and we do not hold the  
assets as a trustee. We and our creditors cannot reach those assets to satisfy  
other obligations until our obligations under your Contract have been           
satisfied. But all of our assets (except those we hold in some other separate   
accounts) are available to satisfy our obligations under your Contract.         

The Account is not registered as an investment company under the Investment     
Company Act of 1940.

Securities Fund is to generate a high level of total return through above       
average current income, while maintaining the potential for capital             
appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by concentrating its      
investments in equity securities of issuers whose value is derived primarily    
from development, management and market pricing of underlying real estate       
properties.

The Contracts

Unallocated Group Annuity Contracts                                             

The Contracts are unallocated group annuity contracts. The Contracts do not     
provide for the establishment of individual accounts for Plan or Trust          
participants until participants become entitled to receive benefits from the    
Plan or Trust. When a participant retires or otherwise becomes entitled to      
receive benefits, you may direct us to pay annuity benefits to the participant. 
(See "Retirement Benefits", p. 17). We will then issue the Annuitant a          
Certificate describing the benefits which have been selected. (See "Variable
Payment Plans", p. 17.) Benefits available to Participants are determined       
entirely by the provisions of the Plan or Trust.                                

Purchase Payments Under The Contracts                                           

Amount and Frequency  You determine the amount and frequency of purchase        
payments subject to the provisions of the Plan or Trust. You may pay larger or  
additional purchase payments. However, we will not accept (a) any purchase      
payment unless it is a contribution for funding or for the payment of fees or   
loads under a pension or profit-sharing plan or trust which meets the           
requirements of Section 401 of the Code or the requirements for deduction of    
the employer's contribution under Section 404(a)(2) of the Code; or (b) any     
purchase payment of less than $100.                                             

You may pay purchase payments monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually or on  
any other frequency acceptable to us. If a purchase payment is not paid when    
due, or if we decline to accept a purchase payment as provided above, the       
Contract will continue in force unless you redeem all Accumulation Units for    
their value. You may resume payment of purchase payments at any time the        
Contract is in force.                                                           

Application of Purchase Payments  We credit net purchase payments to your       
Contract, after deduction of any sales load or installation fee, and we         
allocate the payments as you direct. To the extent that you direct a net        
purchase payment to accumulate on a variable basis we place it in the Account   
and allocate it to one or more Divisions. Assets we allocate to each Division   
we thereupon invest in shares of the Portfolio or Fund which corresponds to     
that Division. If we receive no allocation instructions, we will place the net  
purchase payment in the Money Market Division.                                  

We apply payments we place in the Account to provide "Accumulation Units" in    
one or more Divisions. Accumulation Units represent your interest in the        
Account. The number of Accumulation Units provided by each net purchase payment 
is determined by dividing the amount to be allocated to a Division by the value 
of an Accumulation Unit in that Division, based upon the next valuation of the  
assets of the Division we make after we receive your purchase payment at our    
Home Office. We will also accept your purchase payment if you send it to a      
lockbox facility we have designated. We value assets as of the close of trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange for each day the Exchange is open.               

The number of your Accumulation Units will be increased by additional purchase  
payments and decreased by withdrawals. The investment experience of the Account 
does not change the number (as distinguished from the value) of your            
Accumulation Units.                                                             

The value of an Accumulation Unit in each Division varies with the investment   
experience of the Division. This in turn is determined by the investment        
experience of the corresponding Portfolio or Fund. We determine the value of an 
Accumulation Unit on any date by multiplying the value on the immediately       
preceding valuation date by the net investment factor for the Division for the  
current period. (See "Net Investment Factor", p. 16.) Since you bear the        
investment risk, there is no guarantee as to the aggregate value of your        
Accumulation Unit. That value may be less than, equal to or more than the       
cumulative net purchase payments you have made.                                 

Net Investment Factor                                                           

For each Division the net investment factor for any period ending on a          
valuation date is 1.000000 plus the net investment rate for the Division for    
that period. Under the Contract the net investment rate is related to the       
assets of the Division. However, since all amounts are simultaneously invested  
in shares of the corresponding Portfolio or Fund when allocated to the          
Division, calculation of the net investment rate for each of the Divisions may  
also be based upon the change in value of a single share of the corresponding   
Portfolio or Fund.                                                              

Thus, for example, in the case of the Balanced Division the net investment rate 
is equal to (a) the change in the net asset                                     

16                                                                              

Account C Prospectus                                                            

P-->485BPOS19th�Page�of�90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
value of a Balanced Portfolio share for the period from the immediately         
preceding valuation date up to and including the current valuation date, plus   
the per share amount of any dividends and other distributions made by the       
Balanced Portfolio during the valuation period, less a deduction for any        
applicable taxes or for any expenses resulting from a substitution of           
securities, (b) divided by the net asset value of a Balanced Portfolio share at 
the beginning of the valuation period, (c) less an adjustment to provide for    
the charge for mortality rate and expense guarantees. (See "Deductions", p. 20.)

The Portfolios and Funds will distribute investment income and realized capital 
gains to the Account Divisions. We will reinvest those distributions in         
additional shares of the same Portfolio or Fund. Unrealized capital gains and   
realized and unrealized capital losses will be reflected by changes in the      
value of the shares held by the Account.                                        

Benefits Provided Under The Contracts                                           

The benefits provided under the Contracts consist of a surrender value and a    
retirement benefit. Subject to the restrictions noted below, we will pay all of 
these benefits in a lump sum or under the payment plans described below. We     
will take the amounts required to pay benefits from the Divisions of the        
Account, or from the value accumulated on a fixed basis, as you direct.         

Surrender or Withdrawal Value  To the extent permitted by the Plan or Trust,    
you may terminate the Contract and redeem the value of Accumulation Units       
credited to the Contract. We determine the value, which may be either greater   
or less than the amount you have paid, as of the valuation date coincident with 
or next following our receipt of a written request for termination. Request     
forms are available from our Home Office and our agents. You may surrender a    
portion of the Accumulation Units on the same basis.                            

A payee under Payment Plan 1 may elect to withdraw the present value of any     
unpaid income payments at any time. Upon death during the certain period of the 
payee under Plan 2 or both payees under Plan 3, the beneficiary may elect to    
withdraw the present value of any unpaid payments for the certain period. We    
base the withdrawal value on the Annuity Unit value on the withdrawal date,     
with the unpaid payments discounted at the Assumed Investment Rate. (See        
"Description of Payment Plans", below.)                                         

Retirement Benefits  You may direct us to pay retirement benefits to an         
Annuitant at any time while your Contract is in force. Upon your request,       
benefits may be paid in a lump sum or under the Payment Plans described below.  
Your request will state the Payment Plan you have elected and the amount and    
date of the first payment. Amounts distributed to an Annuitant may be subject   
to federal income tax. A 10% penalty tax may be imposed on the taxable portion  
of premature payments of benefits (prior to age 59 1/2 or disability) unless    
payments are made after the employee separates from service and payments are    
either paid in substantially equal installments over the life or life           
expectancy of the employee or are paid on account of early retirement after age 
55.                                                                             

We will determine the amount required to pay the annuity or cash benefits and   
will redeem Accumulation Units in that amount. There is no assurance that       
amounts accumulated under the Contract will be sufficient to provide the        
retirement benefits under the Plan or Trust.                                    

Variable Payment Plans                                                          

We will pay part or all of the benefits under a Contract under a variable       
payment plan you select. Under a variable plan the payee bears the entire       
investment risk, since no guarantees of investment return are made.             
Accordingly, there is no guarantee of the amount of the variable payments, and  
you must expect the amount of such payments to change from month to month.      

Under a variable Payment Plan an Annuitant must select the initial allocation   
of variable benefits among the Divisions. The Annuitant may name and change the 
beneficiaries of unpaid payments for the specified period under Plan 1 or the   
certain period under Plans 2 or 3. We will issue the Annuitant a Certificate    
describing the variable annuity benefits and including beneficiary provisions   
of annuity contracts we issue on the date of issue of the Certificate. For a    
discussion of tax considerations and limitations regarding the election of      
payment plans, see "Federal Income Taxes", p. 19.                               

Description of Payment Plans  The following payment plans are available:        

1. Payments for a Certain Period.  An annuity payable monthly for a specified   
period of five to 30 years.                                                     

2. Life Annuity with or without Certain Period.  An annuity payable monthly     
until the payee's death, or until the expiration of a selected certain period,  
whichever is later. After the payee's death during the certain period, if any,  
payments becoming due are paid to the designated contingent beneficiary. A      
certain period of either 10 or 20 years may be selected, or a plan with no      
certain period may be chosen.                                                   

3. Joint and Survivor Life Annuity with Certain Period.  An annuity payable     
monthly for a certain period of 10 years and thereafter to the Annuitant and    
the Joint Annuitant for their joint lives. On the death of either payee,        
payments continue for the remainder of the 10 years certain or the remaining    
lifetime of the survivor, whichever is longer.                                  

A Payment Plan must result in payments that meet the minimums we require for    
annuity payment plans on the date you elect the plan. From time to time we may  
establish payment plan rates with greater actuarial value than those stated in  
the Contract and make them available at the time of settlement. We may also     
make available other payment plans, with provisions and rates as we publish for 
those plans.                                                                    

Amount of Annuity Payments  We will determine the amount of the first annuity   
payment on the basis of the particular Payment Plan you select, the annuity     
payment rate and, for plans involving life contingencies, the Annuitant's       

                                                          Account C Prospectus

                                                                            17

P-->485BPOS20th�Page�of�90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
adjusted age. We will calculate the amount of the first annuity payment on a    
basis that takes into account the length of time over which we expect annuity   
payments to continue. The first payment will be lower for an Annuitant who is   
younger when payments begin, and higher for an Annuitant who is older, if the   
payment plan involves life contingencies. The first payment will be lower if    
the payment plan includes a longer certain period. Variable annuity payments    
after the first will vary from month to month and will depend upon the number   
and value of Annuity Units credited to the Annuitant. Annuity Units represent   
the interest of the Annuitant in each Division of the Account.                  

Assumed Investment Rate  The payment rate tables for the Contracts are based    
upon an Assumed Investment Rate of 3 1/2%. Payment rate tables based upon an    
Assumed Investment Rate of 5% are also available where permitted by state law.  

The Assumed Investment Rate affects both the amount of the first variable       
payment and the amount by which subsequent payments increase or decrease. The   
Assumed Investment Rate does not affect the actual value of the future payments 
as of the date when payments begin.                                             

Over a period of time, if each Division achieved a net investment result        
exactly equal to the Assumed Investment Rate applicable to a particular Payment 
Plan, the Annuity Unit for each Division would not change in value, and the     
amount of annuity payments would be level. However, if the Division achieved a  
net investment result greater than the Assumed Investment Rate, the amount of   
annuity payments would increase. Similarly, if the Division achieved a net      
investment result smaller than the Assumed Investment Rate, the amount of       
annuity payments would decrease.                                                

A higher Assumed Investment Rate will result in a larger initial payment but    
more slowly rising and more rapidly falling subsequent payments than a lower    
Assumed Investment Rate.                                                        

Additional Information                                                          

Transfers Between Divisions and Payment Plans  You may change the allocation of 
net purchase payments among the Divisions or transfer Accumulation Units from   
one Division to another at any time. After the effective date of a variable     
Payment Plan the Annuitant may transfer Annuity Units from one Division to      
another. Changes in allocation and transfers are effective on the date we       
receive a written request at our Home Office or on a future specified date.     

We will adjust the number of Accumulation or Annuity Units to be credited to    
reflect the respective value of the Accumulation and Annuity Units in each of   
the Divisions. You may transfer Accumulation Units among the Divisions up to    
twelve times in a Contract year without charge. The charge for each additional  
transfer is $25. We may set charges and waiting periods for transfers of        
Annuity Units.                                                                  

If you contemplate the transfer of funds from one Division to another, you      
should consider the risk inherent in a switch from one investment medium to     
another. In general, frequent transfers based on short-term expectations for    
the securities markets, especially transfers of large sums, will tend to        
accentuate the danger that a transfer will be made at an inopportune time.      
Frequent transfers, or transfers that are large in relation to the assets of    
the Portfolio or Fund in which a Division invests, may also be disruptive and   
may disadvantage other investors. We reserve the right to limit the frequency   
or amount of transfers. See the attached prospectuses for the Funds for more    
information about their frequent trading policies. We will assist the Funds in  
the implementation of their policies.                                           

After the effective date of a variable Payment Plan which includes the right of 
withdrawal a payee may transfer the withdrawal value to any other Payment Plan. 
An administrative charge may apply.                                             

Owners of the Contracts  The Owner of the Contract has the sole right to        
exercise all rights and privileges under the Contract, except as the Contract   
otherwise provides. The Owner is ordinarily the employer, a custodian or        
trustee. In this prospectus, "you" means the owner or a prospective purchaser   
of a Contract. The Annuitant is a Participant in the Plan or Trust who has been 
named to receive annuity payments in accordance with the provisions of the Plan 
or Trust.                                                                       

Deferment of Benefit Payments  We reserve the right to defer determination and  
payment of the surrender value of the Accumulation Units, the withdrawal value  
under a variable Payment Plan, or the payment of benefits under a variable      
Payment Plan. Deferral will arise only if the right to redeem shares of a       
Portfolio or Fund is suspended, payment of the redemption value is postponed,   
or the New York Stock Exchange is closed, or trading thereon is restricted; or  
an emergency exists, as a result of which it is not reasonably practical for us 
to dispose of securities we own, or to determine the value of Accumulation or   
Annuity Units.                                                                  

Dividends  The Contracts share in our divisible surplus, except while payments  
are being made under a payment plan. Our divisible surplus is determined        
annually. We credit each Contract's share, if any, as a dividend on the         
Contract anniversary. Under the terms of the Contract, we will apply any        
dividend as a net purchase payment allocated to the Money Market Division.      

On Group Combination Annuity Contracts, dividends arise principally as a result 
of more favorable expense experience than that assumed in determining mortality 
rate and expense guarantee charges. The dividend is based on the average        
variable Contract value which is defined as the value of the Accumulation units 
on the last Contract anniversary adjusted to reflect any transactions since     
that date which increased or decreased the Contract's interest in the Account.  

For 2004, all front-load and simplified-load Contracts with an average variable 
Contract value of $250,000 or more will receive a dividend of 0.25% of the      
average variable Contract value. For the simplified-load Contracts, this factor 
increases to 0.75% on the portion of the average variable Contract value in     
excess of $500,000. In future years, dividends will continue                    

18

to be based on actual experience, and as a result, the factors may be different 
from those stated above.                                                        

Substitution and Change  We reserve the right to (a) substitute other           
securities for shares of each Portfolio or Fund held by any Division, or (b)    
change the provisions of the Contracts to assure qualification for tax benefits 
under the Internal Revenue Code or to comply with any other applicable federal  
or state laws. We may make appropriate endorsement on Contracts having an       
interest in the Account and take such other action as may be necessary to       
effect the substitution or change. You will be given prompt notice after any    
substitution or change.                                                         

Amendments and Termination  After the fifth Contract year, we may amend the     
Contract with respect to (1) the sales load; (2) the maximum annual annuity     
rate and expense guarantee charge; (3) the administration fee; (4) the transfer 
fee; (5) the minimum amounts for purchase payment(s) and for the Contract       
value; or (6) the payment rate tables which are included in the Contract.       

An amendment will not become effective until after we have given you at least   
30 days' written notice. An Amendment to the payment rate tables will not apply 
to a Payment Plan that starts before the amendment becomes effective.           

We reserve the right to terminate a Contract if representations you have made   
to us are or become incorrect. You may terminate a Contract in whole or in part 
at any time and we will pay you the value of the Accumulation Units.

Federal Income Taxes                                                            

We offer the Contracts only for use under tax-qualified plans meeting the       
requirements of Sections 401 and 403(a) of the Code. However, in the event we   
should issue Contracts pursuant to HR-10 Plans, trusts or custodial accounts    
which at the time of issuance are not qualified under the Code, some or all of  
the tax benefits described herein may be lost.                                  

Contribution Limits                                                             

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, enacted on June
7, 2001, made substantial changes to the contribution limits and withdrawal and 
portability restrictions of tax qualified plans. These changes are reflected    
below. Although the Act generally became effective on January 1, 2002, many     
provisions are phased in over a ten-year period. Also all of these changes will 
sunset (be repealed) in 2011, unless extended or made permanent.                

Any employer, including a self-employed person, can establish a plan under      
Section 401(a) or 403(a) for participating employees. As a general rule, annual 
contributions to a defined contribution plan made by the employer and the       
employee cannot exceed the lesser of $41,000 (indexed for 2004) or 100% of      
compensation or earned income (up to $205,000, indexed for 2004). The           
employer's deduction for contributions is limited to 25% of eligible payroll.   

Salary reduction contributions made under a cash or deferred arrangement        
(401(k) plan) are limited to $13,000 for 2004, increasing by $1,000 annually to 
$15,000 in 2006,indexed thereafter. This annual dollar limit applies to the     
aggregate of all "elective deferrals" to all tax-favored plans of the employee. 
Employees who are age 50 or over may also make a catch up contribution of       
$3,000 for 2004, $4,000 for 2005, and $5,000 for 2006, indexed thereafter.      

Qualified plans are subject to minimum coverage, nondiscrimination and spousal  
consent requirements. In addition, "top heavy" rules apply if more than 60% of  
the contributions or benefits are allocated to certain highly compensated       
employees. Violations of the contribution limits or other requirements may      
disqualify the plan and/or subject the employer to taxes and penalties.         

Taxation of Contract Benefits                                                   

No tax is payable as a result of any increase in the value of a Contract until  
benefits from the Contract are received. Benefits received as annuity payments  
will be taxable as ordinary income when received in accordance with Section 72  
of the Code. As a general rule, where an employee makes nondeductible           
contributions to the Plan, the payee may exclude from income that portion of    
each benefit payment which represents a return of the employee's "investment in 
the contract" as defined in Section 72 until the entire "investment in the      
contract" is recovered.                                                         

Benefits paid in a form other than an annuity will be taxed as ordinary income  
when received except for that portion of the payment, if any, which represents  
a return of the employee's "investment in the contract." Benefits received as a 
"lump sum distribution" by individuals born before January 1, 1936 may be       
eligible for a separate tax averaging calculation. With certain limited         
exceptions, all benefits are subject to tax-free rollover provisions of the     
Code. A 10% penalty tax may be imposed on the taxable portion of premature      
payments of benefits (prior to age 59 1/2 or disability) unless payments are    
made after the employee separates from service and payments are either paid in  
substantially equal installments over the life or life expectancy of the        
employee or are paid on account of early retirement after age 55 or unless      
payments are made for medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of the employee's      
Adjusted Gross Income.                                                          

A loan from the Plan to an employee may be taxable as ordinary income depending 
on the amount and terms of the loan.                                            

Benefit payments will be subject to mandatory 20% withholding unless payments   
are rolled over directly to a                                                   

P-->485BPOS22nd�Page�of�90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
traditional IRA or "eligible employer plan" that accepts rollovers. An          
"eligible employer plan" includes a tax-qualified plan, an individual           
retirement arrangement, a tax-deferred annuity, or a governmental Section 457   
plan. Exceptions apply if benefits are paid in substantially equal installments 
over the life or life expectancy of the employee (or of the employee and the    
employee's beneficiary) or over a period of 10 years or more, are "required     
minimum distributions," or are due to hardship.                                 

Minimum Distribution Requirements  As a general rule, the Plan is required to   
make certain required distributions to the employee during the employee's life  
and to the employee's beneficiary following the employee's death. A 50% penalty 
tax may be imposed on payments to the extent they are less than these required  
minimum amounts.                                                                

The Plan must make the first required distribution by the "required beginning   
date" and subsequent required distributions by December 31 of that year and     
each year thereafter. Payments must be made according to the Uniform Lifetime   
Table provided in IRS regulations, which calculates life expectancy of the      
employee and an assumed beneficiary who is ten years younger. The required      
beginning date is April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the       
calendar year in which the employee attains age 70 1/2 or, if the employee is   
not a "5% owner" of the employer, the calendar year in which the employee       
retires.                                                                        

Upon the death of the employee, the Plan must make distributions under one of   
two main rules: (1) the life expectancy rule, or (2) the five year rule.        

(1) Life Expectancy Rule:  A beneficiary may take distributions based on the    
beneficiary's life or life expectancy. Generally, distributions must commence   
by December 31 of the year following the year of the Owner's death. (See below  
for exception for spouse beneficiary.)                                          

(2) Five Year Rule:  If the Owner dies before the required beginning date, a    
beneficiary may elect to withdraw the entire account balance over five years,   
completing distribution no later than December 31 of the year containing the    
fifth anniversary of the Owner's death.                                         

Spousal Exceptions:  If the employee's spouse elects the life expectancy rule,  
distributions do not need to begin until the end of the year following the year 
of the employee's death or, if later, by the end of the year the employee would 
have attained age 70 1/2. Alternatively, the spouse may roll over the Contract  
into an IRA owned by the spouse or to any other plan in which the spouse        
participates that accepts rollovers. The spouse may then defer distributions    
until the spouse's own required beginning date.                                 

The rules governing plan provisions, payments and deductions and taxation of    
distributions from such Plans and Trusts, as set forth in the Code and the      
regulations relating thereto, are complex and cannot be readily summarized.     
Furthermore, special rules are applicable in many situations. You should        
consult qualified tax counsel before you adopt an HR-10 pension or              
profit-sharing plan or trust.                                                   

Taxation of Northwestern Mutual                                                 

We may charge the appropriate Contracts with their shares of any tax liability  
which may result from the maintenance or operation of the Divisions of the      
Account. We are currently making no charge. (See "Net Investment Factor", p. 16 
and "Deductions", p. 20.)

Account C Prospectus

Deductions                                                                      

We will make the following deductions:                                          

1. Deductions from Purchase Payments.                                           

Front Load Contract                                                             

We deduct a sales load from all purchase payments we receive. The sales load    
compensates us for the costs we incur in selling the Contracts. We base the     
deduction on the cumulative amounts we have received and the rates in the table 
below:                                                                          

                                                                [Download Table]

Cumulative Purchase Payments Paid Under the Contract Rate
---------------------------------------------------- ----
                                                         
              First $150,000........................ 4.5%
              Next $350,000......................... 3.0%
              Next $500,000......................... 1.0%
              Balance over $1,000,000............... 0.5%

Simplified Load Contract                                                        

We deduct an installation fee in the amount of $750 from the first purchase     
payment we receive. Alternatively, you may pay the fee separately when you      
submit the application for the Contract. The installation fee covers the        
non-recurring expenses of processing the application and issuing the Contract.  

2. Annual Mortality Rate and Expense Guarantee Charge.  The net investment      
factor (see "Net Investment Factor", p. 16) we use in determining the value of  
Accumulation and Annuity Units reflects a charge on each valuation date for     
mortality and expense risks we have assumed. For the front-load Contract the    
charge on an annual basis is 0.65% of the current value of the net assets of    
the Account. For the simplified-load Contract the charge on an annual basis is  
1.25% of the net assets. We may increase this charge to a maximum of 1.00% for  
the front-load Contract and 1.50% for the simplified-load Contract. After the   
fifth Contract year we may amend the maximum. (See "Amendments and              
Termination", p. 19.)                                                           

The mortality risk is that annuity payments will continue for longer periods    
than anticipated because the Annuitants as a group live longer than expected.   
The expense risk is that the charges we make may be insufficient to cover the   
actual costs we incur in connection with the Contracts. We assume these risks   
for the duration of the Contract.                                               

P-->485BPOS23rd�Page�of�90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
The net investment factor also reflects the deduction of any reasonable         
expenses which may result if there were a substitution of other securities for  
shares of the mutual funds as described under "Substitution and Change", p. 19, 
and the deduction of any applicable taxes. Applicable taxes could include any   
tax liability we have paid or reserved for resulting from the maintenance or    
operation of a Division of the Account. We do not presently anticipate that any 
deduction will be made for federal income taxes (see "Federal Income Taxes", p. 
19), nor do we anticipate that maintenance or operation of the Account will     
give rise to any deduction for state or local taxes. However, we reserve the    
right to charge the appropriate Contracts with their shares of any tax          
liability which may result under present or future tax laws from the            
maintenance or operation of the Account or to deduct any such tax liability in  
the computation of the net investment factor for such Contracts.                

3. Administration Fee.  We may terminate a Contract on 60 days' written notice  
after it has been in force for one year if the total Contract value (including  
any amounts held on a fixed basis) is less than the minimum Contract value of   
$25,000. In lieu of terminating the Contract we may charge an administration    
fee of $150 annually on the Contract anniversary.                               

4. Premium Taxes.  The Contracts provide for the deduction of applicable        
premium taxes, if any, from purchase payments or from Contract benefits.        
Various jurisdictions levy premium taxes. Premium taxes presently range from 0% 
to 2% of total purchase payments. Many jurisdictions presently exempt from      
premium taxes annuities such as the Contracts. As a matter of current practice, 
we do not deduct premium taxes from purchase payments received under the        
Contracts or from Contract benefits. However, we reserve the right to deduct    
premium taxes in the future.                                                    

5. Expenses for the Portfolios and Funds.  The expenses borne by the Portfolios 
and Funds in which the assets of the Account are invested are described in the  
prospectuses for Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., the Fidelity VIP Mid    
Cap Potfolio and the Russell Investment Funds. See the prospectuses attached to 
this prospectus.                                                                

                                                          Account C Prospectus

                                                                            21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution of the Contracts                                                   

We will sell the Contracts through individuals who are licensed insurance       
agents appointed by Northwestern Mutual and are registered representatives of   
Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, our wholly-owned company.         
Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC is a registered broker-dealer      
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National          
Association of Securities Dealers. Where state law requires, these agents will  
also be licensed securities salesmen. Commissions paid to the agents on sales   
of the Contracts are calculated partly as a percentage of purchase payments and 
partly as a percentage of Contract values for each Contract year. We do not     
expect total commissions, on average, to exceed the equivalent of 7.0% of       
purchase payments.                                                              

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contracts Issued Prior to January 1, 1992                                       

For Contracts issued prior to January 1, 1992 the purchase payments are subject 
to a charge for sales expenses. This deduction is at the rate of 4.0% on the    
first $25,000; 2.0% on the next $75,000; 1.0% on the next $100,000; 0.4% on the 
next $100,000; 0.2% on the next $200,000; and 0.1% on the balance over $500,000 
of cumulative purchase payments. For these Contracts there is also an annual    
service fee charged on each anniversary, based on the value of Accumulation     
Units on the last valuation date of the Contract year, at the rate of 0.5% on   
the first $100,000; 0.4% on the next $100,000; 0.3% on the next $100,000; 0.2%  
on the next $200,000; and 0.1% on the balance over $500,000. The charge for     
annuity rate and expense risks may not exceed 0.25% of the Account assets held  
for these Contracts (unless the Contracts are amended after the fifth Contract  
year), and we currently are making no charge for these risks. These Contracts   
contain no provisions for accumulation of funds on a fixed basis. See the table 
of accumulation unit values on page 12.

 DETERMINATION OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS

The following discussion of the method for determining the amount of  
monthly annuity payments under a variable payment plan is intended to be read in
conjunction with these sections of the prospectus for the Contracts: "Variable
Payment Plans", p. 17, including "Description of Payment Plans", p. 17, "Amount 
of Annuity Payments", p. 18, and "Assumed Investment Rate", p. 18; "Dividends", 
p. 19; "Net Investment Factor", p. 17; and "Deductions", p. 21.                 

    Amount of Annuity Payments The amount of the first annuity payment will be
determined on the basis of the particular Payment Plan selected, the annuity    
payment rate and, for plans involving life contingencies, the Annuitant's       
adjusted age. The amount of the first payment is the sum of the payments from   
each Division. The payments from each Division are determined by multiplying the
applicable monthly variable annuity payment rate by the benefits allocated to   
the Division under the variable Payment Plan. (See "Illustrations of Variable   
Annuity Payments".) Payment rate tables are set forth in the Contracts. Annuity 
payment rates currently in use by Northwestern Mutual are based on the 1983     
Table a with Projection Scale G.                                                

     Variable annuity payments after the first will vary from month to month and
will depend upon the number and value of Annuity Units credited to the          
Annuitant. The amount held under a Payment Plan will not share in the divisible 
surplus of Northwestern Mutual.                                                 

    The number of Annuity Units in each Division is determined by dividing the
amount of the first annuity payment from the Division by the value of an Annuity
Unit on the effective date of the Payment Plan. The number of Annuity Units thus
credited to the Annuitant in each Division remains constant throughout the      
annuity period. However, the value of Annuity Units in each Division will       
fluctuate with the investment experience of the Division.                       

   The amount of each variable annuity payment after the first is the sum of
payments from each Division. The payments from each Division are determined by  
multiplying the number of Annuity Units credited to the Annuitant in the        
Division by the value of an Annuity Unit for the Division on (a) the fifth      
valuation date prior to the payment due date if the payment due date is a       
valuation date, or (b) the sixth valuation date prior to the payment due date if
the payment due date is not a valuation date. To illustrate,                    

 B-2

P-->485BPOS28th�Page�of�90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
if a payment due date falls on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the amount of the  
payment will normally be based upon the Annuity Unit value calculated on the    
preceding Friday. The preceding Friday would be the fifth valuation date prior  
to the Friday due date, and the sixth valuation date prior to the Saturday or   
Sunday due dates.                                                               

Annuity Unit Value The value of an Annuity Unit for each Division was 
arbitrarily established as of the date on which the operations of the Division  
began. The value of an Annuity Unit on any later date varies to reflect the     
investment experience of the Division, the Assumed Investment Rate on which the 
annuity rate tables are based, and the annuity rate and expense guarantee       
charge.                                                                         

The Annuity Unit value for each Division on any valuation date is     
determined by multiplying the Annuity Unit value on the immediately preceding   
valuation date by two factors: (a) the net investment factor for the current    
period for the Division; and (b) an adjustment factor to neutralize the Assumed 
Investment Rate used in calculating the mortality rate tables.                  

Illustrations of Variable Annuity Payments To illustrate the manner in
which variable annuity payments are determined consider this example. Item (2)  
in the example shows the applicable monthly payment rate for an annuitant,      
adjusted age 65, who has elected a life annuity Payment Plan with a certain     
period of 10 years with an Assumed Investment Rate of 3-1/2% (Plan 2, as        
described in the prospectus).                                                   

(1)  Value of Annuitant's retirement benefit                          
     allocated to Balanced.............................   $   50,000

(2)  Assumed applicable monthly payment rate per                      
     $1,000 from annuity rate table....................   $     5.00

(3)  Amount of first payment from Balanced Division                   
     (1) x (2) divided by $1,000.......................   $   250.00

(4)  Assumed Value of Annuity Unit in Balanced                        
     Division on effective date of payment plan........   $ 1.500000

(5)  Number of Annuity Units credited in Balanced                     
     Division, (3) divided by (4)......................       166.67

The $50,000 value on the effective date of the payment plan provides a first    
payment from the Balanced Division of $250.00, and payments thereafter of the   
varying dollar value of 166.67 Annuity Units. The amount of subsequent payments 
from the Balanced Division is determined by multiplying 166.67 units by the     
value of an Annuity Unit in the Balanced Division on the applicable valuation   
date. For example, if that unit value is $1.501000, the monthly payment from the
Division will be 166.67 multiplied by $1.501000, or $250.17.                    

   However, the value of the Annuity Unit depends entirely on the investment
performance of the Division. Thus in the example above, if the net investment   
rate for the following month (see "Net Investment Factor") was less than the    
Assumed Investment Rate of 3-1/2%, the Annuity Unit would decline in value. If  
the Annuity Unit value declined to $1.499000 the succeeding monthly payment     
would then be 166.67 X $1.499000, or $249.84.                                   

  For the sake of simplicity the foregoing example assumes that all of the
Annuity Units are in the Balanced Division. If there are Annuity Units in two or
more Divisions, the annuity payment from each Division is calculated separately,
in the manner illustrated, and the total monthly payment is the sum of the      
payments from the Divisions.

VALUATION OF ASSETS OF THE ACCOUNT

    The value of Portfolio or Fund shares held in each Division of the Account
at the time of each valuation is the redemption value of such shares at such    
time. If the right to redeem shares of a Portfolio or Fund has been suspended,  
or payment of redemption value has been postponed, for the sole purpose of      
computing annuity payments the shares held in the Account (and Annuity Units)   
may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Trustees
of Northwestern Mutual.                                                         

TRANSFERABILITY RESTRICTIONS

     Ownership of a Contract may be transferred subject to the terms of the Plan

NML Variable Annuity Account C
December 31, 2003                                                               

Note 1 -- NML Variable Annuity Account C (the "Account") is a segregated asset  
account of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company ("Northwestern
Mutual") used to fund variable annuity contracts ("contracts") for HR-10 and    
corporate pension and profit-sharing plans which qualify for special tax        
treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. Currently, two versions of the       
contract are offered: Front Load contracts with a sales charge up to 4.5% of    
purchase payments and Simplified Load contracts with an installment fee of $750.

Note 2 -- The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with        
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America        
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and       
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ  
from those estimates. Principal accounting policies are summarized below.       

Note 3 -- All assets of each Division of the Account are invested in shares of  
the corresponding Portfolio of Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., Fidelity  
VIP Mid Cap Portfolio and the Russell Investment Funds (collectively known as   
"the Funds"). The shares are valued at the Funds' offering and redemption       
prices per share. The Funds are open-end investment companies registered under  
the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                             

Note 4 -- Annuity reserves, included in equity, are based on published annuity  
tables with age adjustment and benefit payments which reflect actual investment 
experience. Annuity reserves are based on the 1983 Annuity Table a adjusted     
with assumed interest rates of 3.5% or 5%.                                      

Note 5 -- Dividend income and distributions of net realized gains from the      
Funds are recorded on the ex-date of the dividends. Transactions in Funds'      
shares are accounted for on the trade date. The basis for determining cost on   
sale of the Funds' shares is identified cost. Purchases and sales of the Funds' 
shares for the period ended December 31, 2003 by each Division are shown as     
follows: (in thousands)

Note 6 -- A deduction for annuity rate and expense guarantees is determined     
daily and paid to Northwestern Mutual as compensation for assuming the risk     
that annuity payments will continue for longer periods than anticipated because 
the annuitants as a group live longer than expected, and the risk that the      
charges made by Northwestern Mutual may be insufficient to cover the actual     
costs incurred in connection with the contracts.                                

For contracts issued after December 16, 1981, and prior to May 1, 1984, the     
deduction is determined daily at an annual rate of .5% of the net assets of     
each Division attributable to these contracts and is paid to Northwestern       
Mutual. For these contracts, the rate may be increased or decreased by the      
Board of Trustees of Northwestern Mutual not to exceed a .75% annual rate.      

Generally, for contracts issued after December 31, 1991, for the Front Load     
version and the Simplified Load version, the deduction for annuity rate and     
expense guarantees is determined daily at annual rates of .65% and 1.25%,       
respectively, of the net assets of each Division attributable to these          
contracts and is paid to Northwestern Mutual. For these contracts, the rates    
may be increased or decreased by the Board of Trustees of Northwestern Mutual   
not to exceed 1% and 1.5% annual rates, respectively.                           

Since 1996, Northwestern Mutual has paid a dividend to certain contracts. The   
dividend is re-invested in the Account and has been reflected as a Contract     
Owners' Net Payment in the accompanying financial statements.                   

Note 7 -- Northwestern Mutual is taxed as a "life insurance company" under the  
Internal Revenue Code and the operations of the Account form a part of and are  
taxed with those of Northwestern Mutual. Under current law, no federal income   
taxes are payable with respect to the Account. Accordingly, no provision for    
any such liability has been made.

conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing  
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require     
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes   
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial  
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included direct       
confirmation of securities owned at December 31, 2003 with Northwestern Mutual  
Series Fund, Inc., Fidelity VIP Mid Cap Portfolio and the Russell Insurance     
Funds, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   Basis of Presentation and Changes in Accounting Principles                 

  The accompanying consolidated statutory financial statements include the
accounts of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and its    
wholly-owned subsidiary, Northwestern Long Term Care Insurance Company
    (together, "the Company"). All intercompany balances and transactions have
  been eliminated. The Company offers life, annuity, disability income and
 long-term care insurance products to the personal, business, and estate
markets.                                                              

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Office of the     
  Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("statutory basis of
accounting"). Financial statements prepared on the statutory basis of 
 accounting differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with
   generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), primarily because on a
GAAP basis: (1) certain policy acquisition costs are deferred and     
amortized, (2) investment valuations and policy benefit reserves use  
  different methods and assumptions, (3) deposit-type contracts, for which
premiums, benefits and reserve changes are not included in revenue or 
benefits as reported in the statement of operations, are defined      
differently, (4) majority-owned, non-insurance subsidiaries are       
    consolidated, (5) changes in deferred taxes are reported as a component of
    net income, and (6) no deferral of realized investment gains and losses is
permitted. The effects on the financial statements of the Company     
   attributable to the differences between the statutory basis of accounting
and GAAP are material.                                                

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                 

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the statutory
basis of accounting required management to use assumptions or make    
   estimates that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
   the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual future results could 
differ from these assumptions and estimates.                          

Investments                                                           

    See Note 3 regarding the reported statement value and estimated fair value
of the Company's investments in bonds, common and preferred stocks,   
mortgage loans and real estate.                                       

Policy Loans                                                          

    Policy loans primarily represent amounts borrowed from the Company by life
    insurance policyowners, secured by the cash value of the related policies.
    They are reported in the financial statements at unpaid principal balance.

Other Investments                                                     

Other investments consist primarily of real estate joint ventures,    
partnership investments (including real estate, venture capital and   
leveraged buyout fund limited partnerships), leveraged leases and     
 unconsolidated non-insurance subsidiaries. These investments are valued
  based on the equity method of accounting, which approximates fair value.
     Other investments also include derivative financial instruments. See Note 4
regarding the Company's use of derivatives and their valuation in the 
financial statements.                                                 

Temporary Investments                                                 

    Temporary investments represent securities that had maturities of one year
     or less at purchase, and are reported at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net Investment Income                                                 

    Net investment income primarily represents interest and dividends received
     or accrued on bonds, mortgage loans, policy loans and other investments. It
  also includes amortization of any purchase premium or discount using the
interest method, adjusted prospectively for any change in estimated   
    yield-to-maturity. Accrued investment income more than 90 days past due is
nonadmitted and reported as a direct reduction of surplus. Accrued    
    investment income that is ultimately deemed uncollectible is reported as a
     reduction of net investment income in the period that such determination is
 made. Net investment income also includes dividends paid to the Company
from accumulated earnings of joint ventures, partnerships, and        
     unconsolidated subsidiaries. Net investment income is reduced by investment
    management expenses, real estate depreciation, depletion related to energy
assets and interest costs associated with securities lending.         

Interest Maintenance Reserve                                          

The Company is required to maintain an interest maintenance reserve   
    ("IMR"). The IMR is used to defer realized gains and losses, net of income
tax, on fixed income investments that are attributable to changes in  
interest rates. Net realized gains and losses deferred to the IMR are 
amortized into investment income over the estimated remaining term to 
maturity of the investment sold.                                      

Investment Capital Gains and Losses                                   

Realized capital gains and losses are recognized based upon specific  
 identification of securities sold. Realized capital losses also include
     valuation adjustments for impairment of bonds, stocks, mortgage loans, real
    estate and other investments that have experienced a decline in fair value
     that management considers to be other-than-temporary. Factors considered in
    evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary include: (1)
     whether the decline is substantial, (2) the Company's ability and intent to
retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an 
 anticipated recovery in value, (3) the duration and extent to which the
 fair value has been less than cost, and (4) the financial condition and
 near-term prospects of the issuer. Realized capital gains and losses as
reported in the consolidated statement of operations exclude any IMR  
deferrals. See Note 3 regarding details of realized capital gains and 
losses.                                                               

Unrealized capital gains and losses primarily represent changes in the
   reported fair value of common stocks and changes in valuation adjustments
made for bonds in or near default. Changes in the Company's share of  
    undistributed earnings of joint ventures, partnerships, and unconsolidated
     subsidiaries are also classified as changes in unrealized capital gains and
     losses. See Note 3 regarding details of changes in unrealized capital gains
and losses.                                                           

Asset Valuation Reserve                                               

     The Company is required to maintain an asset valuation reserve ("AVR"). The
 AVR represents a general reserve liability for invested asset valuation
using a formula prescribed by the National Association of Insurance   
Commissioners ("NAIC"). The AVR is designed to protect surplus against
    potential declines in the value of the Company's investments. Increases or
decreases in AVR are reported as direct adjustments to surplus.       

Separate Accounts                                                     

  See Note 7 regarding separate account assets and liabilities reported by
the Company.                                                          

Premium Revenue                                                       

    Life insurance premiums are recognized as revenue at the beginning of each
policy year. Annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance  
premiums are recognized as revenue when received by the Company.

without life contingencies are deposit-type transactions and thereby  
    excluded from revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Premium
revenue is reported net of ceded reinsurance, see Note 9.             

Other Income                                                          

    Other income primarily represents ceded reinsurance expense allowances and
various insurance policy charges.                                     

Benefit Payments to Policyowners and Beneficiaries                    

     Benefit payments to policyowners and beneficiaries include death, surrender
and disability benefits, as well as matured endowments and payments on
    supplementary insurance contracts that include life contingencies. Benefit
  payments on supplementary insurance contracts without life contingencies
 are deposit-type transactions and thereby excluded from benefits in the
    consolidated statement of operations. Benefit payments are reported net of
ceded reinsurance recoveries, see Note 9.                             

Reserves for Policy Benefits                                          

See Note 5 regarding the methods and assumptions used to establish the
Company's reserves for future insurance policy benefits.              

Commissions and Operating Expenses                                    

 Commissions and other operating costs, including costs of acquiring new
insurance policies, are generally charged to expense as incurred.     

Electronic Data Processing Equipment and Software                     

The cost of electronic data processing ("EDP") equipment and operating
     system software used in the Company's business is generally capitalized and
    depreciated over three years using the straight-line method. Non-operating
    system software is generally capitalized and depreciated over a maximum of
    five years. EDP equipment and operating software assets of $25 million and
  $20 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are reported in
  other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position and are
net of accumulated depreciation of $56 million and $48 million,       
respectively. Non-operating software costs, net of accumulated        
 depreciation, are nonadmitted assets and thereby excluded from reported
 assets and surplus in the consolidated statement of financial position.
   Depreciation expense totaled $42 million, $27 million and $14 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.       

Furniture and Equipment                                               

The cost of furniture, fixtures and equipment, including leasehold    
     improvements, is generally capitalized and depreciated over the useful life
of the assets using the straight-line method. Furniture, fixtures and 
  equipment costs, net of accumulated depreciation, are nonadmitted assets
   and thereby excluded from reported assets and surplus in the consolidated
   statement of financial position. Depreciation expense totaled $6 million,
   $6 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.                                                   

Policyowner Dividends                                                 

Almost all life insurance and disability income policies and certain  
 annuity contracts and long-term care policies issued by the Company are
     participating. Annually, the Company's Board of Trustees approves dividends
    payable on participating policies during the subsequent fiscal year, which
are accrued and charged to operations when approved. Participating    
     policyowners generally have the option to direct their dividends to be paid
    in cash, used to reduce future premiums due or used to purchase additional
 insurance. A majority of dividends are used by policyowners to purchase
additional insurance and are reported as premiums in the consolidated

statement of operations, but are not included in premiums received or 
policy benefits paid in the consolidated statement of cash flows.     

Nonadmitted Assets                                                    

Certain assets are designated as nonadmitted on the statutory basis of
 accounting. Such assets, principally assets related to pension funding,
     amounts advanced to or due from the Company's financial representatives and
furniture, fixtures, equipment, and non-operating software (net of    
    accumulated depreciation) are excluded from reported assets and surplus in
  the consolidated statement of financial position. Changes in nonadmitted
assets are reported as a direct adjustment to surplus.                

Reclassifications                                                     

   Certain financial statement balances have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation.                                        

3.   Investments                                                                

Bonds                                                                 

    Investments in bonds are reported in the financial statements at amortized
cost, less any valuation adjustment. The interest method is used to   
   amortize any purchase premium or discount. Use of the interest method for
  loan-backed bonds and structured securities includes estimates of future
   prepayments obtained from independent sources. Prepayment assumptions are
   updated at least annually, with the prospective adjustment method used to
recognize related changes in the estimated yield-to-maturity of such  
securities.                                                           

Valuation adjustments are made for bonds in or near default, which are
    reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, or for bonds with a
     decline in fair value that management considers to be other-than-temporary.

Estimated fair value is based upon values published by the Securities 
Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC. In the absence of SVO-published 
values, estimated fair value is based upon quoted market prices, if   
    available. For bonds without quoted market prices, fair value is estimated
    using independent pricing services or internally developed pricing models.

    Statement value and estimated fair value of bonds at December 31, 2003 and
2002 were as follows:

Common and Preferred Stocks                                           

  Common stocks are generally reported in the financial statements at fair
   value, which is based upon quoted market prices, if available. For common
stocks without quoted market prices, fair value is estimated using    
  independent pricing services or internally developed pricing models. The
equity method is used to value investments in common stock of         
unconsolidated subsidiaries.                                          

  Preferred stocks rated "1" (highest quality), "2" (high quality), or "3"
 (medium quality) by the SVO are reported in the financial statements at
amortized cost. All other preferred stock is reported at the lower of 
 amortized cost or fair value. Estimated fair value is based upon quoted
market prices, if available. For preferred stock without quoted market
prices, fair value is estimated using independent pricing services or 
internally developed pricing models.

Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001

Mortgage Loans                                                        

     Mortgage loans are reported in the financial statements at unpaid principal
balance, less any valuation allowance or unamortized commitment or    
origination fee. Such fees are generally deferred upon receipt and    
    amortized into investment income using the interest method. Mortgage loans
   are collateralized by properties located throughout the United States and
   Canada. The Company attempts to minimize mortgage loan investment risk by
    diversification of borrowers, geographic locations and types of collateral
properties.                                                           

     The maximum and minimum interest rates for mortgage loans originated during
   2003 were 8.5% and 3.6%, respectively, while these rates during 2002 were
    8.2% and 5.0%, respectively. The aggregate average ratio of amounts loaned
  to the value of collateral for mortgage loans originated during 2003 and
    2002 were 66% and 65%, respectively, with a maximum of 100% for any single
loan during each of 2003 and 2002.                                    

    Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information,
     management considers it probable that the Company will be unable to collect
  all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the
   loan. If necessary, a valuation adjustment is made to reduce the carrying
value of an impaired loan to the lower of unpaid principal balance or 
estimated net realizable value based on appraisal of the collateral   
  property. If the impairment is considered to be temporary, the valuation
 adjustment is reported as an unrealized loss. Valuation adjustments for
    impairments considered to be other-than-temporary are reported as realized
     losses. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the reported value of mortgage loans
was reduced by $13 million and $44 million, respectively, in valuation
adjustments.                                                          

Real Estate                                                           

   Real estate investments are reported in the financial statements at cost,
     less any valuation adjustment, encumbrances and accumulated depreciation of
buildings and other improvements using a straight-line method over the
     estimated useful lives of the improvements. An investment in real estate is
    considered impaired when, based on current information, the estimated fair
  value of the property is lower than depreciated cost. The estimated fair
  value is primarily based upon the present value of future cash flow (for
  commercial properties) or the capitalization of stabilized net operating
  income (for residential properties). When the Company determines that an
  investment in real estate is impaired, a valuation adjustment is made to
 reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value, net of encumbrances.
     Valuation adjustments are reported as a realized loss. At both December 31,
2003 and 2002 there was no valuation adjustment in determining the reported
value of real estate investments.                                     

   At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the reported value of real estate included
$180 million and $124 million, respectively, of real estate properties
occupied by the Company.                                              

Leveraged Leases                                                      

  Leveraged leases are reported in the financial statements at the present
value of future minimum lease payments, plus the residual value of the
leased asset. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the reported value of    
leveraged leases was $513 million and $532 million, respectively. The 
reported value of leveraged leases at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was  
     reduced by $0 and $108 million, respectively, to reflect a decline in value
of certain aircraft leases that management considered to be           
    other-than-temporary. The decline in value was charged against an existing
    valuation allowance and was not reported as a realized capital loss during
2002. Leveraged leases are included in other investments and primarily
   represent investments in commercial aircraft or real estate property that
are leased to third parties and serve as collateral for non-recourse  
borrowings.

Securities Lending                                                    

    The Company has entered into securities lending agreements whereby certain
investment securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major    
 brokerage firms. The Company's policy requires a minimum of 102% of the
fair value of the loaned securities, calculated on a daily basis, as  
    collateral in the form of either cash or securities held by the Company or
     a trustee. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, unrestricted cash collateral held
    by the Company of $2.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, is reported
     in cash and invested assets and the offsetting collateral liability of $2.5
     billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, is reported in other liabilities in
the consolidated statement of financial position. Additional non-cash 
     collateral of $482 million and $389 million is held on the Company's behalf
by a trustee at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is not  
included in the consolidated statement of financial position.         

Repurchase Agreements                                                 

The Company has entered into agreements whereby the Company sells and 
  agrees to repurchase certain mortgage-backed securities. At December 31,
2002, the book value of securities subject to these agreements and included
in the reported value of bonds was $1.0 billion, while the repurchase 
   obligation liability of $1.0 billion was reported in other liabilities in
 the consolidated statement of financial position. Securities subject to
 these agreements had contractual maturities of 30 years at December 31,
2002 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.8%. There were no      
outstanding repurchase commitments at December 31, 2003.              

4.   Derivative Financial Instruments                                           

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into derivative  
    transactions, generally to mitigate the risk to Company assets and surplus
of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
other market risks. Derivative investments are reported as other      
    investments in the consolidated statement of financial position. Cash flow
   and fair value hedges that qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for
  in a manner consistent with the hedged item (e.g. amortized cost or fair
value) whereas cash flow and fair value hedges that do not qualify for
   hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value. Fair value is estimated
as the amount that the Company would expect to receive or pay upon    
termination of the contract at the reporting date.                    

  In addition to cash flow and fair value hedges, the Company entered into
     replication transactions during 2003 and 2002. A replication transaction is
a derivative transaction entered into in

investment characteristics of otherwise permissible investments.          

The Company does not take positions in derivatives for income generation  
purposes.                                                                 

   The Company implemented Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles ("SSAP")
 No. 86, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
superceded SSAP 31, effective January 1, 2003. Upon implementation the    
Company had the option of applying the new guidance to all derivatives to 
 which the Company was a party to as of January 1, 2003 or continuing to use
  the existing guidance of SSAP 31 for all derivatives held as of December 31,
2002. The Company chose to apply SSAP 86 guidance retroactively to        
derivatives held prior to January 1, 2003. The impact on surplus from the 
adoption of SSAP 86 was considered to be immaterial.                      

  The Company held the following derivative positions at December 31, 2003 and
2002:

on certain floating rate bonds. An interest rate swap is a contractual    
 agreement to pay a floating rate of interest, based upon a reference index,
in exchange for a fixed rate of interest established at the origination of
the contract.                                                             

  Swaptions are cash flow hedges used to mitigate the asset/liability risks of
a significant and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates for    
certain of the Company's insurance products. Swaptions are a contractual  
agreement whereby one party holds an option to enter into an interest rate
swap with another party on predefined terms.                              

Interest rate floors are cash flow hedges used to mitigate the            
asset/liability risks of a significant and sustained decrease in interest 
rates. Floors entitle the Company to receive settlement payments from the 
counterparties if interest rates decline below a specified level.         

 Short equity index futures contracts are fair value hedges that are used to
mitigate exposure to market fluctuations for the Company's portfolio of   
common stocks. Futures contracts obligate the Company to buy or sell a    
financial instrument at a specified future date for a specified price.    

Fixed income futures contracts are fair value hedges used to mitigate     
  interest rate risk for a portion of its fixed maturity investment portfolio.
These futures contracts obligate the Company to buy or sell a financial   
instrument at a specified future date for a specified price.              

   Foreign currency forward contracts are fair value hedges used to mitigate the
foreign exchange risk for portfolios of investments denominated in foreign
currencies. Foreign currency forward contracts obligate the Company to    
deliver a specified amount of foreign currency at a future date at a      
specified exchange rate.                                                  

   Credit default swaps are fair value hedges used to protect against a decrease
in bond prices due to credit concerns for certain bond issuers. A credit  
   default swap allows the Company to put the bond to a counterparty at par upon
 a "credit event" sustained by the bond issuer. A credit event is defined as
bankruptcy, failure to pay, or obligation acceleration.                   

Commodity swaps are fair value hedges used to mitigate exposure to market 
fluctuations for the forward sale of crude oil and natural gas production.
Commodity swaps are agreements whereby one party pays a floating commodity
price in exchange for a specified fixed commodity price.                  

Credit default swap replication transactions are used by the Company to   
create a fixed income investment through the use of derivatives and cash  
  market instruments. These replication transactions, including the derivative
  component, are reported at amortized cost. During 2003 and 2002, the average
fair value of such contracts was $0 and ($1) million, respectively. No    
realized gains or losses were recognized during 2003 or 2002 on the       
termination of such contracts.                                            

Long fixed income futures replication contracts are used by the Company to
manage the duration of the fixed income portfolio and mitigate exposure to
interest rate changes. These replication transactions are reported at fair
value, with changes in fair value reflected as a component of unrealized  
   gains and losses until such time as the contracts are terminated. During 2003
  and 2002, the average fair value of such contracts was $0. Realized gains of
$29 million and $5 million were recognized during 2003 and 2002 on the    
termination of such contracts.                                            

Long equity futures replication contracts are used by the Company to gain

5. Reserves for Policy Benefits                                                 

   Reserves for policy benefits represent the net present value of future policy
benefits, less future policy premiums, estimated using actuarial methods  
based on mortality and morbidity experience tables and valuation interest 
  rates prescribed or permitted by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance
  of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"). Use of these actuarial tables and methods
  involved assumptions regarding future mortality and morbidity. Actual future
experience could differ from the assumptions used to make these estimates.

General account reserves for policy benefits at December 31, 2003 and 2002
are summarized below:

 Life insurance reserves on substantially all policies issued since 1978 are
 based on the Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method ("CRVM") with interest
rates ranging from 3 1/2% to 5 1/2% and the 1958 or 1980 CSO mortality    
tables. Other life insurance reserves are primarily based on the net level
   premium method, using various mortality tables at interest rates ranging from
  2% to 4 1/2%. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has $810 billion of total
life insurance in-force, including $8.7 billion of life insurance in-force
   for which gross premiums are less than net premiums according to the standard
valuation methods and assumptions prescribed by the OCI.                  

 As of January 1, 2001, the Company changed the valuation basis for reserves
  on certain term life insurance policies. The impact of this change increased
policy benefit reserves by $61 million, and was reported as a direct      
reduction of surplus for the year ended December 31, 2001.                

 Tabular cost has been determined from the basic data for the calculation of
policy reserves. Tabular cost less actual reserves released has been      
 determined from the basic data for the calculation of reserves and reserves
released. Tabular interest has been determined from the basic data for the
  calculation of policy reserves. Tabular interest on funds not involving life
  contingencies is calculated as the product of the valuation rate of interest
times the mean of the amount of funds subject to such rate held at the    
beginning and end of the year of valuation.                               

Additional premiums are charged for substandard lives for policies issued

the date of death. Cash values are not promised in excess of the legally  
computed reserves.                                                        

  Deferred annuity reserves on contracts issued since 1985 are primarily based
on the Commissioner's Annuity Reserve Valuation Method with interest rates
 ranging from 3 1/2% to 6 1/4%. Other deferred annuity reserves are based on
contract value. Immediate annuity reserves are based on present value of  
expected benefit payments at interest rates ranging from 3 1/2% to 7 1/2%.
Changes in future policy benefits on supplementary contracts without life 
contingencies are classified as deposit-type transactions and thereby     
excluded from net additions to policy benefit reserves in the consolidated
statement of operations, see Note 2.                                      

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the withdrawal characteristics of the      
Company's general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities were as
follows:

Unpaid claims and claim reserves for DI policies are based on the present 
 value of expected benefit payments, primarily using the 1985 CIDA (modified
for Company experience in the first four years of disability) and interest
rates ranging from 3% to 5 1/2%. Unpaid claims and claim reserves for     
 long-term care policies are based on the present values of expected benefit
  payments using industry-based long-term care experience with a 4.5% interest
rate.                                                                     

Reserves for unpaid claims, losses, and loss adjustment expenses on       
disability income and long-term care insurance were $3.1 billion and $2.9 
 billion at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The table

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The changes in reserves for incurred claims related to prior years are    
 generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends.

  Active life reserves for disability income ("DI") policies issued since 1987
are primarily based on the two-year preliminary term method using a 4%    
interest rate and the 1985 Commissioner's Individual Disability Table A   
  ("CIDA") for morbidity. Active life reserves for prior DI policies are based
on the net level premium method, with interest rates ranging from 3% to 4%
and the 1964 Commissioner's Disability Table for morbidity.               

Active life reserves for long-term care policies consist of mid-terminal  
reserves and unearned premium. Mid-terminal reserves are based on the     
  one-year preliminary term method, industry-based experience morbidity, total
terminations based on the 1983 Individual Annuity Mortality table without 
   lapses or the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality table with lapses, and an interest
rate of either 4% or the minimum rate allowable for tax purposes. When the
  tax interest rate is used, lapses are not included in total terminations and
reserves are compared in the aggregate to the statutory minimum and the   
greater of the two is held.                                               

6. Premium and Annuity Considerations Deferred and Uncollected                  

Gross deferred and uncollected insurance premiums represent life insurance
premiums due to be received from policyowners through the next respective 
policy anniversary dates. Net deferred and uncollected premiums represent 
   only the portion of gross premiums related to mortality charges and interest.

Deferred and uncollected premiums at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as   
follows:

Separate account assets and related policy liabilities represent the      
  segregation of balances attributable to variable life insurance and variable
annuity policies. Policyowners bear the investment performance risk       
associated with variable products. Separate account assets are invested at
the direction of the policyowner in a variety of mutual fund options.     
Variable annuity policyowners also have the option to invest in a fixed   
  interest rate annuity issued by the general account of the Company. Separate
account assets are reported at fair value based primarily on quoted market
prices.

    While separate account liability values are not guaranteed by the Company,
  the variable annuity and variable life insurance products represented in
the separate accounts do include guaranteed minimum death benefits    
  underwritten by the Company. At both December 31, 2003 and 2002, general
   account reserves for policy benefits included $11 million attributable to
these benefits.                                                       

    Premiums and other considerations received from variable life and variable
     annuity policyowners during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
    $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. These amounts are reported as
premiums in the consolidated statement of operations. The subsequent  
transfer of these receipts to the Separate Accounts is reported in net
     transfers to separate accounts in the consolidated statement of operations,
  net of amounts received from the Separate Accounts to provide for policy
benefit payments to variable product policyowners.                    

   Following is a summary reconciliation of amounts reported as transfers to
  and from separate accounts in the summary of operations of the Company's

8.   Employee and Representative Benefit Plans                                  

   The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans for
all eligible employees and financial representatives. These include   
     tax-qualified plans, as well as nonqualified plans that provide benefits to
 certain participants in excess of ERISA limits for qualified plans. The
 Company's policy is to fully fund the obligations of qualified plans in
  accordance with ERISA requirements. In 2003, the Company contributed $28
  million to the qualified employee retirement plan. No contributions were
required during 2002 or 2001.

Plan assets are invested primarily in common stocks and corporate debt
securities through a separate account of the Company. Asset mix is    
     re-balanced regularly to maintain ratios of approximately 60% equities, 35%
fixed income investments, and 5% cash equivalents. Fair value of plan 
assets is based primarily on quoted market values.                    

     The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial net present value
    of future benefit obligations, which is estimated annually by the Company.
     The following table summarizes assumptions used in estimating the projected
benefit obligations at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001:

    The projected benefit obligations for post-retirement benefits at December

costs of 10%, grading down to 5% over 5 years and remaining level     
   thereafter. A further increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend of 1%
in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit    
obligation as of December 31, 2003 by $18 million and net periodic    
     postretirement benefit expense during 2003 by $3 million. A decrease in the
assumed healthcare cost trend of 1% in each year would reduce the     
  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2003 by
    $18 million and net periodic postretirement benefit expense during 2003 by
$3 million.

Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001

Projected benefit obligations included $28 million and $12 million for
non-vested employees at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.     

    Following is an aggregate reconciliation of the funded status of the plans
     to the net liability reported by the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

     Unrecognized net experience gains or losses represent cumulative amounts by
   which plan experience for return on plan assets or benefit costs has been
more or less favorable than assumed. These net differences accumulate 
without recognition in the Company's financial statements unless they 
 exceed 10% of plan assets or projected benefit obligation, whichever is
  greater. If they exceed this limit, they are amortized into net periodic
    benefit costs over the remaining average years of service until retirement
of the plan participants, which is currently fourteen years.          

Unrecognized initial net assets represent the amount by which the fair
   value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation for funded
   pension plans upon the adoption of new statutory accounting principles at
     January 1, 2001. The Company has elected not to record an initial asset for
     this excess, electing instead to utilize the excess through amortization of
     this initial asset as a credit to net periodic benefit cost in a systematic
manner until exhausted.                                               

Any pension assets for funded plans are nonadmitted under statutory   
     accounting and are thereby excluded from reported assets and surplus in the
consolidated statement of financial position.                         

   The components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, were as follows:

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001

   December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company expensed total contributions
   to these plans of $23 million, $22 million and $20 million, respectively.

9.   Reinsurance                                                                

 The Company limits its exposure to life insurance death benefits on any
 single insured by ceding insurance coverage to various reinsurers under
excess and coinsurance contracts. The Company retains a maximum of $25
     million of coverage per individual life policy and a maximum of $35 million
of coverage per joint life policy. The Company also participates in   
    catastrophic risk sharing pools and has an excess reinsurance contract for
certain disability income policies issued prior to 1999 with retention
limits varying based upon coverage type.                              

    Amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements are reported net of
 the impact of reinsurance. Reserves for policy benefits at December 31,
2003 and 2002 were reported net of ceded reserves of $1.0 billion and $877
million, respectively.                                                

   The effect of reinsurance on premium revenue and benefits expense for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows:          

                                                                [Download Table]

     In addition, the Company earned $184 million, $172 million and $161 million
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in
allowances from reinsurers for reimbursement of commissions and other 
   expenses on ceded business. These amounts are reported in other income in
the consolidated statement of operations.                             

  Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to
     policyowners. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result
 in losses to the Company. The Company attempts to minimize this risk by
 diversifying its reinsurance coverage among a number of reinsurers that
meet its standards for strong financial condition. There were no      
reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2003 and 2002, which were    
considered by management to be uncollectible.

The Company collects from or refunds to these subsidiaries their share of
    consolidated income taxes determined under written tax-sharing agreements.
    Federal income tax returns for years through 1999 are closed as to further
    assessment of tax. The liability for income taxes payable in the financial
  statements includes a provision for additional taxes that may become due
with respect to the open tax years.                                   

     The Company accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities, which reflect
    the financial statement impact of cumulative temporary differences between
the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. The  
     components of the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
as follows:

   The statutory basis of accounting limits the amount of gross deferred tax
  assets that can be included in Company surplus. This limit is based on a
  formula that takes into consideration available loss carryback capacity,
expected timing of reversal for existing temporary differences, gross 
    deferred tax liabilities and the level of Company surplus. At December 31,
2003 and 2002, the Company's gross deferred tax assets did not exceed this
limitation.

The Company's taxable income can vary significantly from gain from    
   operations before taxes due to temporary timing and permanent differences
in revenue recognition and expense deduction between book and tax.    

   The Company is subject to an "equity tax" that is assessed only on mutual
  life insurance companies. At December 31, 2001, the liability for income
taxes payable included $453 million related to the Company's estimated
   liability for equity tax, primarily with respect to the 2001 tax year. In
March 2002, Congress passed legislation that suspended assessments of 
     equity tax for tax years 2001 through 2003. As a result, this liability was
released as a current tax benefit during 2002. Barring any additional 
  action by Congress, the equity tax is scheduled to be reinstated for the
2004 tax year.                                                        

 The Company's effective tax rates were 13%, 299%, and 21% for the years
   ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The effective rate
   is not the statutory rate applied to the Company's taxable income or loss
   by the Internal Revenue Service. It is a financial statement relationship
   that represents the ratio between the sum of total taxes, including those
that affect net income and changes in deferred taxes not related to   
unrealized gains and losses on investments, to the sum of gain from   
operations before taxes and pretax net realized gains or losses. These
financial statement effective rates were different than the applicable
   federal tax rate of 35% due primarily to differences between book and tax
     recognition of net investment income and realized capital gains and losses,
prior year adjustments and the impact the of equity tax in 2002.      

  Income taxes incurred in the current and prior years of $1.2 billion are
  available at December 31, 2003 for recoupment in the event of future net
losses.

11.  Frank Russell Company Acquisition and Goodwill                             

     The Company acquired Frank Russell Company ("Russell") effective January 1,
1999 for a purchase price of approximately $955 million plus contingent
     consideration based upon the financial performance of Russell from the date
of acquisition through the five year period ended December 31, 2003.  
   Through December 31, 2003 that contingent consideration had aggregated to
approximately $143 million. Russell, a global leader in multi-manager 
     investment services, provides investment products and services in more than
35 countries. This acquisition was accounted for using the statutory  
purchase method, and the investment is accounted for using the equity 
method, adjusted for the charge-off of acquisition goodwill, and is   
reported in common stocks in the consolidated statement of financial  
   position. Since the date of acquisition, the Company charged-off directly
from surplus approximately $958 million, representing the goodwill    
associated with the acquisition, including the impact on goodwill of  
    contingent consideration. The Company has received permission from the OCI
for this statutory accounting treatment, which is different than that 
  required by the NAIC "Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual", which
     prescribes amortization of goodwill over the period in which the purchasing
entity benefits economically, not to exceed 10 years.                 

12.  Contingencies and Guarantees                                               

The Company has unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of
   Russell, including $350 million of senior notes and up to $150 million of
other credit facilities.                                              

In the normal course of business, the Company has guaranteed certain  
obligations of other affiliates. The maximum exposure under these     
   agreements totaled approximately $62 million at December 31, 2003 and was
   generally mitigated by the underlying net asset values of the affiliates.
  The Company believes that the likelihood is remote that payments will be
    required under these guarantees and therefore has not accrued a contingent
     liability in the consolidated statement of financial position. In addition,
 the Company routinely makes commitments to fund mortgage loans or other
    investments in the normal course of business. These commitments aggregated
   to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2003 and were extended at market interest
rates and terms.                                                      

     The Company is engaged in various legal actions in the normal course of its
   investment and insurance operations. In the opinion of management, losses
that may ultimately result from such actions would not have a material
effect on the Company's financial position at December 31, 2003.      

13.  Related Party Transactions                                                 

During 2003, the Company transferred investments to a majority-owned  
 investment subsidiary as a capital contribution. Realized capital gains
   (losses) of ($7) million were recognized in 2003 on the transfer of these
assets.                                                               

During 2001, the Company transferred appreciated equity investments to
  wholly-owned subsidiaries as a capital contribution to the subsidiaries.
    Realized capital gains of $244 million for 2001 were reported based on the
fair value of the assets at transfer.

  Investment-type insurance reserves   $   3,989     $   3,759     $   3,737     $    3,562

   Fair value of bonds, common and preferred stocks and derivative financial
    instruments are based upon quoted market prices, when available. For those
  not actively traded, fair values are estimated using independent pricing
     services or internally developed pricing models. The fair value of mortgage
    loans is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using market
  interest rates for debt with comparable credit risk and maturities. Real
    estate fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows
   using market interest rates. Policy loan fair value is estimated based on
     discounted projected cash flows using market interest rates and assumptions
regarding future loan repayments based on Company experience. Other   
    investments primarily represent joint ventures and partnerships, for which
the equity method approximates fair value.                            

The fair value of investment-type insurance reserves is estimated by  
discounting estimated future cash flows at market interest rates for  
similar instruments with comparable maturities.                       

15.  Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles                            

    Beginning January 1, 2001, insurance companies domiciled in Wisconsin were
     required to prepare statutory basis financial statements in accordance with
   the new NAIC "Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual," subject to any
variations prescribed or permitted by the OCI.                        

   These new requirements differed from those used prior to January 1, 2001,
primarily because under the new statutory accounting principles: (1)  
  deferred tax balances were established for temporary differences between
book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities, (2) investment  
     valuation adjustments on impaired assets were measured differently and were
reported as realized losses, (3) pension and other employee benefit   
  obligations were accounted for based on the funded status of the related
 plans, (4) recognition of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries and
    affiliates as net investment income was limited to dividends received, (5)
 certain software costs were capitalized and amortized to expense over a
   maximum of five years, and (6) premiums, benefits and reserve changes for
policies without significant mortality or morbidity

  The cumulative effect of adoption of these new accounting principles was
    reported in the consolidated statement of changes in surplus as of January
1, 2001, with no restatement of prior periods permitted. This cumulative
 effect was the difference in the amount of surplus that would have been
reported at that date if the new accounting principles had been       
    retroactively applied to all prior periods. The cumulative effect of these

Report of Independent Auditors                                                  

To the Board of Trustees and Policyowners of                                    
The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                              

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of
The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and its subsidiary ("the
Company") as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated        
statements of operations, of changes in surplus and of cash flows for each of   
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These consolidated       
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our    
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial         
statements based on our audits.                                                 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and       
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial    
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall     
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company prepared these  
consolidated financial statements using accounting practices prescribed or      
permitted by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of        
Wisconsin (statutory basis of accounting), which practices differ from          
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.       
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements are not intended to represent
a presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in   
the United States of America. The effects on the consolidated financial         
statements of the variances between the statutory basis of accounting and       
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,       
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material.              

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements audited by us (1) do not  
present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the 
financial position of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and its    
subsidiary as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, or the results of their operations 
or their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2003 because of the effects of the variances between the statutory basis of     
accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America referred to in the preceding paragraph, and (2) do present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of The Northwestern Mutual Life   
Insurance Company and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the   
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 2003, on the basis of accounting described in Note
1.                                                                              

As discussed in Note 15 to the financial statements, the Company adopted the    
accounting policies in the revised National Association of Insurance            
Commissioners "Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual" - Effective January
1, 2001, as required by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State
of Wisconsin. The effect of adoption is recorded as an adjustment to surplus as 
of January 1, 2001.

Item 31. Management Services                                                    

     There are no contracts, other than those referred to in Part A or Part B of
this Registration Statement, under which management-related services are        
provided to the Registrant and pursuant to which total payments of $5,000 or    
more were made during any of the last three fiscal years.                       

Item 32. Undertakings                                                           

  (a) The Registrant undertakes to file a post-effective amendment to this
Registration Statement as frequently as is necessary to ensure that the audited 
financial statements in the Registration Statement are never more than 16 months
old for so long as payments under the variable annuity contracts may be         
accepted.                                                                       

(b) The Registrant undertakes to include either (1) as part of any    
application to purchase a contract offered by the prospectus, a space that an   
applicant can check to request a Statement of Additional Information, or (2) a  
post card or similar written communication affixed to or included in the        
prospectus that the applicant can remove to send for a Statement of Additional  
Information.                                                                    

(c) The Registrant undertakes to deliver any Statement of Additional  
Information and any financial statements required to be made available under

(d) Reference is made to the indemnification provisions disclosed in  
response to Item 28. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under   
the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and          
controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or  
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as        
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the     
Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling   
person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or       
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in      
connection with the registered securities, the Registrant will, unless in the   
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,    
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such         
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will 
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Variable Annuities with FlexChoice


.







Lifetime Income with Fewer Compromises
Market volatility and today’s long retirements make income you can’t outlive an essential part of your portfolio.
A variable annuity with the optional FlexChoice rider lets you turn a portion of your savings into guaranteed income that lasts for life. You’ll also benefit from market gains while being protected if the market drops. All that plus real-life flexibility to adapt however life unfolds — especially if you’re married. 






At-A-Glance:
 Variable Annuities 



One of the only investments that offer income for life — no matter how long you live.
Have the potential to grow tax-deferred with the market.
Optional living and death benefits offer added protection.


















Income Built for Two
			See why FlexChoice is a lifetime income option married couples may love.

Benefits
           Make your portfolio more balanced and durable with guaranteed lifetime income that can grow.
        



Income


Flexibility


On Your Terms













Income You Can Count On








Earn 5% Growth Per Year
During the first decade, your future income goes up by compounding 5% each year, even if the market goes down or stays flat (as long as you don’t withdraw anything).
Lock in Market Gains
Each year until age 91, if your account value is higher than your Benefit Base due to market performance, you get an Automatic Step-Up that increases future payments.
5% or 6% Withdrawals at Age 65
You can start taking 5% or 6% withdrawals at age 65 depending on your choice of two options.






 

















 

















Unique Flexibility for Married Couples








For However Life Unfolds
Many guaranteed income products make married couples lock in big decisions up front. But with FlexChoice, you don’t have to decide if you want income for one or two lives unless your account value runs out.
More Income Sooner
Unlike many retirement income products, with FlexChoice the amount of income you can withdraw is based on the age of the older owner. That can mean getting a higher withdrawal rate years sooner than if you had to wait for a younger spouse to “catch up.”
Income Built for Two
If a spouse passes away, the surviving spouse continues to receive the same income payments they’ve come to rely on with no interruption.






More about 
 Spousal Flexibility 


Wondering about the cost to cover two people? There’s no extra charge to cover a spouse, and married couples even enjoy the same initial withdrawal rate as single account holders.

Make Decisions When It is Right for You








Turn Withdrawals On and Off
You can start and stop withdrawals at any time after 59½. Waiting to take withdrawals can increase the amount you’re able to withdraw later.
Choose How Much You Get
The income you receive is based on factors you control. They include the age at which you start taking withdrawals, whether you want a steady amount of income or more early on, and if you decide to cover one or two people (only after your account value runs out).
Cancel if You Change Your Mind
In some cases, you may no longer need lifetime income. That’s ok — you have alternatives if your needs change.

There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in this product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value, even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected.

Please contact your financial professional for complete details.
Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution tax that is generally imposed on interest, dividends, and annuity income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.

.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company is an American financial services mutual organization based in Milwaukee. The financial security company provides consultation on wealth and asset income protection, education planning, retirement planning, investment advisory services, trust and private client services, estate planning and business planning. Its products include life insurance, disability income, and long-term care insurance; annuities; investments; and investment advisory products and services.[2]

History[edit]
Northwestern Mutual was founded as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of the State of Wisconsin on March 2, 1857. Originally located in Janesville, Wisconsin, the fledgling company relocated to Milwaukee in 1859. Shortly after, the company experienced its first two death claims, when an excursion train traveling from Janesville to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin derailed, killing 14 people, two of whom were policy owners.[citation needed] With losses amounting to $3,500 and having funds of only $2,000, company President Samuel Daggett and Treasurer Charles Nash personally borrowed the needed funds to pay the claims immediately.
Following the accident, the company saw a rapid increase in its sales and an expansion into new markets. By 1865, it was operating throughout the Midwest and had entered the market along the Eastern Seaboard. To reflect this increased presence, the board of trustees changed the company’s name to The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1864, the company paid its first dividends to policy owners. It again paid dividends in 1867 and 1870, and has done so annually since 1872.[3]
Throughout the early years of the 20th century, Northwestern Mutual focused on life insurance. At the same time, the company worked to increase its accountability. In 1907, company leaders invited policy owners who were not trustees to probe into finances for accountability. This unique tradition has continued to the present day; members of the Policy owners’ Examining Committee have unrestricted access to evaluate Northwestern Mutual’s operations, management and strategic plans independently.[4]
In 1969, the company began offering disability income insurance. Less than a decade later, a series of retirement annuities were introduced for the employee benefits market. In the 1990s, the company saw further growth with the introduction of its long-term care insurance. In 2000, the company changed its name to reflect this broadening of its product offerings to just Northwestern Mutual.[5]
A year later, in 2001, the company continued to expand its product and service offerings by launching a wholly owned subsidiary known today as Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company (NMWMC), a federal savings bank. Through NMWMC, the company offers a range of financial planning products and services including investment management, fee-based financial planning, business retirement plans, and trust and private client services.[2]
In 2015, Northwestern Mutual began construction of Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons.[6][7]
On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual bought financial planning company LearnVest for more than $250 million.[8]
Financial Standings[edit]
Northwestern Mutual has received the following industry ratings: A.M. Best Company, A++ (highest), 4/2017;[9] Fitch Ratings, AAA (highest), 5/2016;[10] Moody's Investors Service, Aaa (highest), 8/2015;[11] and an S&P Global Ratings of AA+ (second highest), 6/2016.[12]
Company subsidiary, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC (NMIS), created in 1968, is ranked 6th among independent broker-dealers.[13]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Investing in Annuities for Your Retirement
 
Retirement in your golden years goes much more smoothly when you've planned ahead with savings and investments. Annuities are a great way to secure your future and live life to the fullest. When you get life insurance, you invest in the future of your family, with annuities you can invest in your own future, as well as your families. You are responsible for yourself and your future, so make sure it's enjoyable by preparing ahead of time.
Annuities are customized by the individual or individuals involved. There are many different options and many providers. Before jumping into it, a lot of thought must be given such as planning what you will need for retirement and what you can afford now. You can discuss these with licensed agents by filling out our quick form so we can connect you with the right licensed agents for your needs. You can then compare annuity quotes with a strong foundation of knowledge.
Who Needs Annuities When I Have Social Security?
Many people are not expecting Social Security to provide all of their retirement needs. For many, it is insufficient, and others are concerned about the long-term stability of the Social Security system and want to have a back-up plan.
Online Insurance Quotes for Your Retirement
Just like obtaining homeowners insurance, planning for your retirement is an important part of ensuring you are financially secure for the rest of your life. Annuity policies are a great way of setting up a fixed or guaranteed income for your retirement. When you shop for online insurance quotes, you can find the right option for your financial needs. There are many benefits to choosing this as part of your retirement plan. Before you can make the right choice, you may want to find out more about this valuable retirement tool.
The simplest explanation of an annuity is a scheduled set of payments that exist for a predetermined period of time. The schedule for and amount of the annuity payments will rely largely on your retirement goals and the period of time until you retire.  Once you have made your scheduled payments, or investments, you will be able to begin receiving payments.  These disbursements will serve as your retirement income. 
Many people prefer annuities for retirement because they come in many flexible options and they provide a guaranteed income upon retirement. The main types are:

Immediate -      Allow you to be paid a set amount of money on a predetermined schedule.
Fixed Period Annuities - Are a more conservative option and come with a minimum interest      rate guaranteed.
Equity-Indexed - Give you the opportunity to earn a higher rate of return.
Variable Annuities - The most      flexible annuity and are subject to rises similar to stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
