Goldman Sachs is pulling back from trading America's hottest investment product

REUTERS/Lucas
  Jackson


  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is pulling back
  substantially from trading that helps backstop the fast-growing
  use of U.S. exchange-traded funds, giving smaller firms an
  opportunity to grab market share.

  Goldman has told fund providers it is scaling back its role as a
  top lead market maker (LMM) for ETFs and has already slashed the
  number of funds it supports in that capacity, according to
  disclosures, fund managers and other trading firms this month.

  Relatively high regulatory and other costs of operating as an LMM
  prompted the pullback by Goldman, one of the few large banks
  remaining in that role, some people said.

  A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on the bank's
  market-making business.

  The move signals the shifting landscape of making markets in many
  assets away from traditional broker-dealers towards smaller,
  electronic-focused upstarts.





  LMMs are critical to keeping ETFs trading smoothly. While
  brokers-dealers can typically trade as they please, firms acting
  as LMMs must consistently offer competitive buy-and-sell quotes
  in their assigned ETFs, and they receive rebates on exchange
  fees. Some also provide start-up financing for the funds.

  The LMMs risk some of their own capital to buy and sell ETFs to
  help maintain their liquidity. Unlike smaller rivals, big banks
  like Goldman Sachs are subject to strict capital requirements by
  regulators, putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to costs
  in an already low-margin business.

  ETFs attracted a record $348 billion globally in the first half
  of this year, compared to $123 billion at the same point last
  year, according to research service ETFGI LLP.

  Despite the skyrocketing growth in ETFs, it can be hard to
  translate the LMM business into a high-margin operation.

  Market making is a technology business as much as a trading
  enterprise, and involves finding the right price for funds
  holding dozens of stocks or bonds in a split second while making
  other trades to manage risk.

  One industry veteran described the business as "scraping
  fractions of pennies all day."

  Goldman continues to make issuing its own ETFs through its asset
  management unit a priority, however, even as it steps back from
  providing the infrastructure to keep such funds trading. 

  Bowing out

  Since last year, the number of ETFs backed by Goldman as a LMM on
  Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE Arca trading venue has
  plunged to 178 from 380, according to documents published by
  NYSE.

  Goldman is no longer the lead market maker on major ETFs
  including the $78 billion iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, $14 billion
  Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF and $8 billion WisdomTree
  Japan Hedged Equity Fund, according to NYSE data.

  NYSE Arca is the largest exchange for ETFs by number of listings.
  Other exchanges offer similar programs to encourage market
  making.

  Bill Belden, head of ETF business development for Guggenheim
  Investments, said Goldman is no longer lead market maker on
  several of their ETFs as of last month, "as they have largely
  stepped out of the LMM business."

  Goldman continues to be a force in ETF trading even as it
  withdraws from LMM assignments at exchanges. It held a 9 percent
  market share for U.S. ETF trading at the end of the second
  quarter, up about 20 percent over the same period last year,
  according to exchange traded volume from NYSE Arca and Nasdaq.

  Stepping in

  One of Goldman's competitors, speaking on condition of anonymity,
  said the bank had "a very attractive book of assignments," adding
  that "there is high demand for [exchange-traded products] that
  Goldman is dropping."

  Lesser-known but deeply experienced trading firms, including New
  York-based Jane Street Group LLC and a subsidiary of
  Amsterdam-based IMC BV, have picked up some of Goldman's former
  LMM assignments, NYSE data shows.

  Despite Goldman's exit, some bank-owned trading operations see
  value in the business, such as RBC Capital Markets, part of Royal
  Bank of Canada, which has stepped into new LMM roles.

  Douglas Yones, NYSE's head of ETFs, said that while some of its
  liquidity providers "have narrowed their presence, it has opened
  the door for many more firms to enter the marketplace with
  positive results."

  Goldman reported overall trading revenue of $3.1 billion during
  the second quarter, a drop of 17 percent from the year ago period
  and the worst start to a year since Chief Executive Lloyd
  Blankfein took the helm of the bank.

  The bank's once-massive LMM franchise was partly the inheritance
  of its $6.5 billion acquisition in September 2000 of Spear Leeds
  & Kellogg LP, which served as lead for the first U.S.-listed
  ETF, the SPDR S&P 500, in the early 1990s.

  In 2014, Goldman wrote down the value of the market making
  operations, including its ETF lead market making rights, and
  signaled a broader change in its strategy when it sold some
  related trading operations to IMC.

Goldman Sachs: Low Cost ETFs Key For Us

October 08, 2015 




 
Cinthia Murphy 





 



  


Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the latest big player to enter the ETF market for the first time. Before you think the firm is late to the party, know that Goldman isn’t vying for a me-too spot. Its two first ETFs are smart-beta funds, but they came with unexpectedly low expense ratios in a segment that’s populated by much higher costs. The ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF (GSLC) costs only 0.09 percent, or $9 per $10,000 invested. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta Emerging Markets Equity ETF (GEM) charges 0.45 percent.

Michael Crinieri, global head of ETF strategy for GSAM, tells us about the firm’s plans.

ETF.com: The first thing that struck me about your first ETF was its expense ratio: smart beta for 9 bps? How are you pulling this off? Are ETFs going to be loss leaders for GSAM?
Michael Crinieri: We aren’t a startup. We’re part of a large financial firm. This is a highly scalable business, and we think we can get to scale very quickly by offering our products at very competitive prices.

We’ve been implementing these strategies for institutional investors for a number of years. We’re now packaging them into the ActiveBeta index and offering an ETF on this index. We want to offer these strategies to a large group of investors at a competitive price.

ETF.com: How is the smart-beta concept—its quasi-active nature, if you will—the best fit for Goldman’s expertise?Crinieri: Goldman Sachs has a lot of experience in the quant space. We’ve been involved in quantitative management for 25 years and manage more than $60 billion in quant strategies. This is a strategy that’s completely rules-based.

It’s a multifactor approach: We’re looking at value, quality, momentum and low volatility. We package the four factors together in an equal-weighted manner. This is a product that’ll give clients diversified exposure and smooth out the ride over various market cycles.

ETF.com: Do you worry about differentiation? Multifactor ETFs are very popular, and we’ve had a lot of them come to market. How are you different?
Crinieri: We think our product will be differentiated based on our structure, our differentiated approach and certainly our pricing. The ActiveBeta strategy is really a good replacement for a traditional market-cap-weighted index. The strategy is benchmark-aware, in that we start with a market-cap-weighted index, and we’re making small tilts to overweight or underweight certain securities based on their scoring in each one of those four factors I mentioned.

ETF.com: Is Goldman going after Northern Trust’s enhanced index assets; in other words, are you looking to grow assets, or are you looking to take market share?
Crinieri: We think this is a good alternative for investors who have already bought into passive management and are just looking for the ability to outperform the traditional market-cap-weighted indexes. That’s the opportunity.

And we think that’s a very broad opportunity, if you think about the number and types of investors that are using traditional index strategies. These products will appeal to individual investors, as well as large institutions.


ETF.com: Some say you’re late to the party. Why make a move into the ETF space now?
Crinieri: First of all, we still think it’s early insofar as the development of the ETF market. There's $2 trillion in assets in U.S. ETFs alone. Goldman Sachs research on the ETF sector concluded that the global ETF market could double in size by 2020. There’s significant room for growth.

But really, the reason we’re doing it now is that our customers are asking for it. Our clients have asked for these strategies in an ETF wrapper. So we’re responding to demand from our clients.

We also think the market has evolved from the traditional index products to more strategic products that are more leaning toward active management, and that really plays to GSAM’s strengths.

ETF.com: Will Goldman remain focused on multifactor approaches? Are you going to consider active ETFs? What comes next?
Crinieri: We intend to have a broad offering of ETFs over time. We’re focusing on the ActiveBeta products right now. We’ve filed for six of those; two are launched already. So there are four additional products to come, including U.S. small-cap, international, Europe and Japan.

We’ve also filed for five liquid alternative strategies, which are hedge fund replication strategies. We have a multistrategy hedge fund replicator, and then four individual hedge fund strategies that we’ve already filed for. And we have a pipeline of other products that we’re working on that have not been filed yet.

ETF.com: To clarify, you’re marketing your first ETFs as “ActiveBeta.” How much of these strategies are actively managed?
Crinieri: These strategies are designed by our quant team, who have a lot of experience in this area, but they are 100 percent rules-based. They’re rebalanced on a quarterly basis, so no one’s making investment decisions along the way. It’s really an index-based strategy.

ETF.com: Can you tell me a little about your first ETFs?
Crinieri: We launched GSLC (the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity) on Sept. 21, priced at 9 bps—very competitive to products in the traditional beta space. This strategy works very well over long periods of time, but also over different geographies.

We apply this strategy to the emerging markets in our Emerging Markets Equity (GEM), which we launched on Sept. 21, just as we apply it to U.S. stocks with very interesting results. This is a great way for investors to think about outperforming the market when it comes to their emerging market allocation at a competitive price.

We’re obviously going through a period of volatility, especially in the emerging markets, but what we’re hearing from clients is that they’re looking for new opportunities in the space, so it’s an interesting time to be bringing a new alternative to the market.

ETF.com: What do you think will be the most difficult thing for Goldman to get traction in the ETF market?
Crinieri: We really think we’re very well-positioned. We have interesting strategies. We’re a well-known asset manager and have a great distribution team that can really help get the word out to our investors. We’re pretty excited about the opportunities.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/).

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF(NASDAQ:COIN): Goldman Sees Wild Swings Ahead | ETF Daily News

































 



























































Goldman Sachs: Bitcoin Will Crash, Then Surge To $3,700


 July 26, 2017 8:35am  NASDAQ:COIN  



 




A prominent Wall Street analyst has changed her tune on bitcoin, and now expects big upside for the cryptocurrency, based on updated technical analysis of BTC’s chart.




Sheba Jafari, the head of technical strategy at Goldman Sachs, notes that bitcoin “may need another few swings” before it tests new highs, however. The analyst says that the inability to break out above BTC’s June 13 high of $3,000 means it may be forming a technical triangle pattern.
A resulting bearish move could take bitcoin down as low as $1,786, she writes, amid as may as five big downswings.
As Business Insider notes, the case gets a lot more bullish from there:
But fear not, says Jafari, because a run at record highs is in the cards as bitcoin remains in the fourth wave of a five wave series. “Anything above 3,000 (Jun. 13th high) will suggest potential to have already started wave V, which again has a minimum target at 2,988 and scope to reach 3,691 (the latter being a preferred target as this assumes a new high.),” Jafari wrote in a note to clients sent out on Monday.
So far Jafari has been spot on in her analysis. In early July, Jafari suggested bitcoin wouldn’t fall too far below $1,857. It fell to somewhere between $1,758 or $1,852 (depending on which data you use). A few weeks earlier, Jafari predicted a big drop was coming after bitcoin hit $3,000.
Bitcoin was trading at $2559.77 on Wednesday morning, down 1.2%. The cryptocurrency has surged 164% year-to-date.
