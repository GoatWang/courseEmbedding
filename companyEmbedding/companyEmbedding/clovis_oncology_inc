Clovis Oncology, Inc. Announces Topline Data from Confirmatory Phase 3 ARIEL3 Trial of Rucaparib
Jun 19 17
Clovis Oncology, Inc. announced topline data from the confirmatory phase 3 ARIEL3 trial of rucaparib, which successfully achieved the primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator review in each of the three populations studied. PFS was also improved in the rucaparib group compared with placebo by blinded independent central review (BICR), a key secondary endpoint. Based on these findings, the Company plans to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) within the next four months for a second-line and later maintenance treatment indication for all women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy. ARIEL3 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of rucaparib that enrolled 564 women with platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.  The primary efficacy analysis evaluated three prospectively defined molecular sub-groups in a step-down manner:  tumor BRCA mutant (tBRCAmut) patients, inclusive of germline and somatic mutations of BRCA; HRD-positive patients, including BRCA-mutant patients and BRCA wild-type with high loss of heterozygosity, or LOH-high patients; and, finally, the intent-to-treat population, or all patients treated in ARIEL3.
Significant Improvement in PFS in the tBRCAmut Patient Population: The most robust clinical outcomes were observed among ARIEL3 patients with a germline or somatic BRCA mutation (n=196). By investigator review, the rucaparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the
placebo arm for the primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio of 0.23 (p(rucaparib) tablets became the first poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as monotherapy for treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more prior chemotherapies.


Clovis Oncology Seeks Acquisitions
Jun 19 17
Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NasdaqGS:CLVS) is seeking acquisitions. Clovis Oncology is raising funds in the amount of approximately $234.9 million or approximately $270.3 million through an offering transaction.

Clovis Oncology to launch $250 mln stock offering
Clovis Oncology Inc.  said on Monday it plans to launch a $250 million stock offering. The announcement follows a 46.5% surge in Clovis Oncology shares after the company released positive late-stage trial results for cancer drug Rubraca. The stock offering proceeds will be used for various general purposes, including sales and marketing for Rubraca. Clovis Oncology itself will be offering all shares of the common stock. Company shares have surged 23.2% over the last three months, compared with a 3.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Clovis Oncology stock surges 50% on positive late-stage cancer trial results
Clovis Oncology Inc.  shares surged 50% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its late-stage trial for a cancer drug met its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint. Clovis said it plans to try for Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug, rucaparib, within the next four months for second line and later maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt described the latest results as "bull case plays out." "The outcome looks to be the best-case-scenario for CLVS," he said, adding "the results look particularly impressive when compared to previous competitor data," including companies like Tesaro  and AstraZeneca , which are also developing a class of cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors. "If approved, Rubraca would have the broadest label of any PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer... which we think should bode well for the commercial uptake of the drug," Schmidt said, calling the company a prime takeout candidate. In three sub-groups of women with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, patients on rucaparib had improved progression-free survival, the phase 3 trial's primary endpoint. Progression-free survival was also improved in patient on the drug as compared with placebo, a key secondary endpoint, Clovis Oncology said. The trial enrolled 564 women. Clovis Oncology shares have dropped 15.9% to $59.97 over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: Analyst
Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet. Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat.

Clovis Oncology to launch $250 mln stock offering
Clovis Oncology Inc.  said on Monday it plans to launch a $250 million stock offering. The announcement follows a 46.5% surge in Clovis Oncology shares after the company released positive late-stage trial results for cancer drug Rubraca. The stock offering proceeds will be used for various general purposes, including sales and marketing for Rubraca. Clovis Oncology itself will be offering all shares of the common stock. Company shares have surged 23.2% over the last three months, compared with a 3.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Clovis Oncology stock surges 50% on positive late-stage cancer trial results
Clovis Oncology Inc.  shares surged 50% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its late-stage trial for a cancer drug met its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint. Clovis said it plans to try for Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug, rucaparib, within the next four months for second line and later maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt described the latest results as "bull case plays out." "The outcome looks to be the best-case-scenario for CLVS," he said, adding "the results look particularly impressive when compared to previous competitor data," including companies like Tesaro  and AstraZeneca , which are also developing a class of cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors. "If approved, Rubraca would have the broadest label of any PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer... which we think should bode well for the commercial uptake of the drug," Schmidt said, calling the company a prime takeout candidate. In three sub-groups of women with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, patients on rucaparib had improved progression-free survival, the phase 3 trial's primary endpoint. Progression-free survival was also improved in patient on the drug as compared with placebo, a key secondary endpoint, Clovis Oncology said. The trial enrolled 564 women. Clovis Oncology shares have dropped 15.9% to $59.97 over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: Analyst
Gilead Sciences (GILD) could fill a hole in its portfolio by acquiring Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday, offering one caveat — Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) would still be a less risky bet. Though Gilead could make a play now for Incyte — to the tune of a 30%-40% premium on its stock price — the No. 3 biotech would largely be betting on the commercial success of Incyte's immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat. Meanwhile, it's dealing with a

Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?
A key hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD) could top Wall Street's expectations, but investors will be tuning into the company's second-quarter report on July 26 for more hints on potential M&A activity, an analyst said Friday. Gilead's hepatitis C sales slipped in 2016 and, in the months following, the No. 3 biotech said it could be open to a deal, especially in oncology. Analysts have been quick to offer up Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO),

Gilead And Vertex Should Join — But Don't Hold Your Breath: Analyst
Gilead Sciences (GILD) would be better off acquiring Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) than an oncology asset like Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday as he lamented Gilead's cautious approach to mergers. The No. 3 biotech by market cap has shown interest in making an oncology-centric buy as it struggles with declining hepatitis C drug sales. The hepatitis C franchise brought in north of $44 billion over three years, but fell
