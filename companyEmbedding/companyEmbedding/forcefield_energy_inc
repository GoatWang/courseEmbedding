Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

										David Natan, President & CEO of ForceField Energy, “A New Force in the Global Renewable Energy Space”

ForceField Energy Website: http://www.forcefieldenergy.com/
ForceField Energy Inc. (OTCQB: FNRG) through its subsidiaries, engages in the manufacture, distribution, and licensing of alternative energy products and technologies in China and the United States. It operates through four segments: Baokai, Wendeng, Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), and Light Emitting Diode (LED). The company designs and installs proprietary modular ORC units utilizing patented multiple refrigerant mixtures to enhance heat recovery and convert waste heat directly from industrial processes, solar and geothermal, and biomass into electrical energy. It also distributes LED commercial lighting and fixtures; and manufactures and sells trichlorosilane, a chemical used for the production of polysilicon that is utilized as a raw material in the production of solar cells for photovoltaic panels. SNNLive spoke with David Natan, President and CEO of ForceField Energy at Cambridge House International’s World Resource Investment Conference 2013 in Vancouver, BC. 
“ForceField is a public company operating in very large energy markets. Symbol as you said, FNRG, we’re over the counter about to be listed on the NASDAQ. We have three distinct product lines. We have a breakthrough waste-heat technology that converts waste-heat to electricity and does it very profitably. We’re a distributor for an LED manufacturer in China and we produce a specialty chemical used in the solar panel process”, Mr. Natan begins, “It’s all large markets. More of our focus is on our waste-heat conversion technology and on our LED lighting division both of which we are very excited about. Our business in China producing specialty chemicals has been a little difficult because of the downturn in the poly-silicon market, so we’re focusing more on the first two products.”
“We’re the exclusive distributor in North America for a company called LED LightSky; prominent manufacturer in China. They were formed by students at Shanghai University, very comparable to a MIT think tank or a Cal Berkeley think tank. So, we’re a distributor. We get a very good transfer price for our product and we’re very competitive in most markets in North America, and we also distribute our product worldwide on a non-exclusive basis,” Mr. Natan states. David has served as Chief Financial Officer for five U.S. public companies and was appointed ForceField’s Chief Executive Officer in December 2010. David retains extensive knowledge of the unique public company operations and management and has direct experience with the AMEX and NASDAQ trading platforms.
