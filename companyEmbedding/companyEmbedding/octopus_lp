Our Products
Octopus Products is your premier distributor of quality laminate sheets and surfacing products. We carry a variety of products from manufacturers throughout the world, giving us one of the widest selections of surfacing materials in North America. Visit us today and let us provide you with material and laminate samples to get you started.
Wall Panels
Panels are needed to not only lend aesthetic quality to a project, but also to impart a layer of protection. We offer a comprehensive selection of modern wall panels for you to choose from. Our stock includes 3D, textured, and decorative wall panels, for any and all projects you need finishing. No matter the architectural surfaces you need, we have the right panels for the job.
Wood Panels
There are a lot of things to wood that make it such an appealing building material. Its organic grain, the warmth it exudes, and its rich natural color‚Äîany architect, fabricator, or designer can appreciate the beauty wood lends to a structure. Octopus Products understands this well, and offers a line of wood paneling for customers to use on their projects. Tongue-and-groove or woven wood panels, we have them all.
Translucent Panels
Sometimes, a project calls for ingenious architecture that maximizes the use of natural light. You could use a regular wall panel, but why stop there? If you need a surface that can make great use of careful lighting, then translucent wall panels might go well with your project. Our collection of advanced translucent panels will bring in light to any space they are used in.
Laminates
Octopus Products carries a full range of laminate products for surfacing. We stock both plastic and wood laminate products in an assortment of different styles, and they are suitable for finishing and adding more design to an existing space. Our high pressure laminates are extremely durable, and will resist minor impacts, weather effects, temperature changes, moisture, and so on.
Flooring
Granite flooring is incredibly hard-wearing, low maintenance, and highly aesthetic to add. If you need such flooring, Octopus Products has you covered. We also carry flooring products produced from durable Murano glass, achieving a similar look to granite, but in a wider variety of colors.
Contact Us
Octopus Products is based in North America, serving customers in Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, New York, and Dallas/Houston. If you have any questions for us about our products, call or email our office closest to you.

What do you get when you take Grath and Azeem from The Steinways and put them in a band with Zack Off With Their Dear Landlord Heads and Mike-d To Die Erg [SA]? House Boat, that's what you get! More specifically, The Delaware Octopus. And what's The Delaware Octopus? Shit if I know! But I can tell you it's catchy, it's clever, it's cynical and it's one of the best pop punk albums you're ever going to hear! Short, sweet and the point... whatever that point may be!

OCEAN REEF NEPTUNE SPACE PREDATOR WITH COMMUNICATION

MSRP: $2,950.00
OCEAN REEF NEPTUNE SPACE PREDATOR WITH COMMUNICATION













SCUBAPRO MK25T EVO/S620Ti

$2,200.00

SCUBAPRO‚Äôs top regulator is a high performing,¬† ultra-light, corrosion-resistant reg system.
The MK25T EVO is machined from a solid block of titanium which will not corrode, even in concentrated saltwater conditions, promising a century of trouble-free use. It offers excellent resistance to freezing, superb inhalation sensitivity and instant delivery of air on demand. The new S620 Ti embraces the best features of SCUBAPRO‚Äôs renowned S600 in an upgraded, state-of-the-art design.¬† Smaller and lighter than the S600 but using the same-sized diaphragm, the S620 Ti delivers excellent performance; work of breathing has been reduced by 37% over the S600, providing effortless airflow under all dive conditions. The full titanium inlet tube is ultra-light, the large purge button improves water circulation, and the new exhaust tee increases performance while directing bubbles out of the field of view for the ultimate in lightweight performance.

Technical Information
First Stage

Air-balanced flow-through piston in a full titanium body provides effortless airflow unaffected by depth, tank pressure, or breathing rate.
Patented XTIS (Extended thermal Insulating system) thermally insulates the inner mechanism from the environment, improving cold-water resistance by 30% and delaying ice formation in extreme cold-water conditions without compromising breathing performance. Key insulation system components are visible in blue.
Anti-freeze protection radically increases breathing reliability when diving in the most extreme water temperatures.
Two opposing high pressure ports allow the first stage to be positioned either up or down.
Four high-flow and one axial super high-flow low pressure ports on a swivel turret maximize hose routing options.
External intermediate pressure adjustment enables technicians to fine-tune performance quickly and easily.
Available in 3364psi/232bar INT.
Weight: INT 232 (oz/g): 16.8/475.
Airflow at 2900psi/200bar: (l/min/SCFM): >8500/301.
Intermediate pressure (psi/bar): 133-142/9.2-9.8.

Second Stage

Air-balanced valve smoothes out the inhalation effort at varying depths and supply pressures.
Rugged reinforced technopolymer case and front cover with stainless steel frame looks good plus is able to withstand years of aggressive diving.
Titanium barrel is rugged, anti-corrosion and lightweight for long-term reliability.
Diaphragm fits inside a more compact casing for maximum breathing sensitivity.
User controls include an easy-grip diver-adjustable inhalation effort knob and Venturi-Initiated Vacuum Assist (VIVA) lever.
New exhaust tee increases performance while directing bubbles out of the field of view.
Newly designed Compact Hi-Flow mouthpiece, exclusive to the S620 Ti, is mounted on an enlarged mouthpiece pipe to improve airflow as well as mouth comfort.
Super-flow hose features an oversized bore that allows more air to flow on each inhalation.
Specific matching colors (blue, pink, yellow, purple, white and orange) on mouthpiece and hose protector are available as an accessory.
Weight (without mouthpiece) (oz/g): 6.3/179.
Airflow at 2900psi/200bar: 1850 l/min.

SCUBAPRO MK25T EVO/S620Ti

$2,200.00

SCUBAPRO‚Äôs top regulator is a high performing,¬† ultra-light, corrosion-resistant reg system.
The MK25T EVO is machined from a solid block of titanium which will not corrode, even in concentrated saltwater conditions, promising a century of trouble-free use. It offers excellent resistance to freezing, superb inhalation sensitivity and instant delivery of air on demand. The new S620 Ti embraces the best features of SCUBAPRO‚Äôs renowned S600 in an upgraded, state-of-the-art design.¬† Smaller and lighter than the S600 but using the same-sized diaphragm, the S620 Ti delivers excellent performance; work of breathing has been reduced by 37% over the S600, providing effortless airflow under all dive conditions. The full titanium inlet tube is ultra-light, the large purge button improves water circulation, and the new exhaust tee increases performance while directing bubbles out of the field of view for the ultimate in lightweight performance.

Technical Information
First Stage

Air-balanced flow-through piston in a full titanium body provides effortless airflow unaffected by depth, tank pressure, or breathing rate.
Patented XTIS (Extended thermal Insulating system) thermally insulates the inner mechanism from the environment, improving cold-water resistance by 30% and delaying ice formation in extreme cold-water conditions without compromising breathing performance. Key insulation system components are visible in blue.
Anti-freeze protection radically increases breathing reliability when diving in the most extreme water temperatures.
Two opposing high pressure ports allow the first stage to be positioned either up or down.
Four high-flow and one axial super high-flow low pressure ports on a swivel turret maximize hose routing options.
External intermediate pressure adjustment enables technicians to fine-tune performance quickly and easily.
Available in 3364psi/232bar INT.
Weight: INT 232 (oz/g): 16.8/475.
Airflow at 2900psi/200bar: (l/min/SCFM): >8500/301.
Intermediate pressure (psi/bar): 133-142/9.2-9.8.

Second Stage

Air-balanced valve smoothes out the inhalation effort at varying depths and supply pressures.
Rugged reinforced technopolymer case and front cover with stainless steel frame looks good plus is able to withstand years of aggressive diving.
Titanium barrel is rugged, anti-corrosion and lightweight for long-term reliability.
Diaphragm fits inside a more compact casing for maximum breathing sensitivity.
User controls include an easy-grip diver-adjustable inhalation effort knob and Venturi-Initiated Vacuum Assist (VIVA) lever.
New exhaust tee increases performance while directing bubbles out of the field of view.
Newly designed Compact Hi-Flow mouthpiece, exclusive to the S620 Ti, is mounted on an enlarged mouthpiece pipe to improve airflow as well as mouth comfort.
Super-flow hose features an oversized bore that allows more air to flow on each inhalation.
Specific matching colors (blue, pink, yellow, purple, white and orange) on mouthpiece and hose protector are available as an accessory.
Weight (without mouthpiece) (oz/g): 6.3/179.
Airflow at 2900psi/200bar: 1850 l/min.

SCUBAPRO MK25 EVO BT/G260 BT

$949.00


RUGGED, ALL-ROUND REG SYSTEM
Technical divers will love the solid breathing performance and proven reliability of this noted reg combo.
No doubt about it, the MK25 EVO/G260 BLACK TECH is a serious reg system designed for the most demanding divers. The air-balanced flow-through piston-style MK25 EVO BLACK TECH is consistently ranked as the top-performing first stage on the market. Its patented Extended Thermal Insulating System (XTIS) lets you enjoy an ultra-fast breathing response, instant delivery of air on demand, great sensitivity and extra-high airflow ‚Äì regardless of how cold the water is. Add the fins on the machined body that provide extra thermal exchange and you have the ultimate first stage for all water temperatures.
With the G260 BLACK TECH SCUBAPRO engineers have taken the most imitated air balanced second stage design of all time and offered it with a rugged, nylon fiberglass casing with freeze-resistant components and fitted with a dark anodized aluminum ring. Inside you have metal components (inlet tube, orifice, inhalation control knob and hose connector) to ensure excellent cold-water performance. It also offers a left-right hose attachment option, making it a great choice for tech diving configurations.
Both first and second stages have a BLACK TECH scratch-resistant coating that protects against the ravages of salt water and corrosion. This durable coating includes an inner layer of chemical Nickel (FDA approved) and an outer glossy DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) finish. It‚Äôs a rugged reg system that delivers solid breathing performance in all diving conditions and water temperatures. It‚Äôs a serious balanced piston breathing system that‚Äôs as tough as it looks. ¬†You can count on this outstanding reg to deliver top-of-the-line performance in all diving conditions and water temperatures, no matter how hard you‚Äôre breathing, how deep you‚Äôre diving, or how cold the water gets.


Technical Information
MK25 EVO BLACK TECH First Stage:

Air balanced flow-through piston in a chrome-plated brass body provides constant and effortless airflow unaffected by depth, tank pressure, or breathing rate.
Patented XTIS (Extended thermal Insulating system) fully insulates the inner mechanism from the environment, improving cold-water resistance by 30% and delaying ice formation in extreme cold-water conditions without com- promising breathing performance.
New spring insulating coating, body insulating bushing (non-metal cylindrical interface separating metal parts from water), anti-freeze cap, bigger body and cap thread all work in concert with the XTIS to improve cold-water performance (key insulation system components are visible in blue).
Anti-freeze protection radically increases breathing reliability when diving in the most extreme water temperatures.
Two opposing high pressure ports allow the first stage to be positioned either up or down.
Five high-flow low pressure ports on a swivel turret maximize hose routing options.
External intermediate pressure adjustment enables technicians to fine-tune performance quickly and easily.
Available in a 3364psi/232bar INT configuration.
