 Educational Background



BA in Economics 


Bucknell University

                  Established in 1846 as the University at Lewisburg; renamed Bucknell University in 1886 in honor of William Bucknell, a major benefactor. The University is highly selective, private, nonsectarian, coeducational (since 1883), residential, and undergraduate, with a small graduate program.                





 Career History

SCS Capital Management LLC


                  SCS Capital Management designs an asset allocation strategy for each client based on the client’s overall wealth management plan. The strategy takes considers the client’s risk tolerance and return objectives to design a portfolio that combines lower return, lower risk investment classes, such as high quality bonds, with higher return seeking asset classes such as public and private equity investments. Most of the portfolio is invested with external investment managers and in SCS funds. The firm may also purchase securities directly to implement a portion of a wealth management program.SCS uses commercially available and proprietary databases to track investment managers in traditional and alternative asset classes. SCS recommends unaffiliated third party investment managers that specialize in the major asset classes, including cash management, fixed income, large-, mid- and small-cap stocks, international securities and alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds.SCS' funds-of-hedge funds programs are designed to preserve and grow capital by producing absolute returns with reduced volatility and low correlation relative to the equity markets. SCS seeks to achieve strong relative performance through an intensive manager selection process while risk is managed through careful portfolio construction and diversification. The SCS invests fund assets among top tier hedge funds managed by new and established external managers. SCS may also invest a portion of certain funds' assets directly in securities and other instruments.In addition to traditional hedge fund strategies, SCS broadly classifies external managers into three categories; Growth, Uncorrelated and Defensive. Growth managers typically have long net exposure to markets. Uncorrelated managers focus on security selection for their returns and do not exhibit a directional bias. Defensive managers construct portfolios designed to offer protection by producing outsized returns in down markets.

SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC  Shareholder Letter  November 29, 2011 
   
  Dear Investors,  The SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC (the “Fund”) returned an estimated 0.56% net of all fees and expenses inception to date through September 30, 2011. 
SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC (the “Fund”) is a multi-strategy fund of hedge funds launched on September 1, 2010. The Fund employs global
research to identify and analyze both established and emerging hedge fund managers. The Fund’s objective is to preserve and grow capital by producing attractive, long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility and lower correlation
relative to the equity markets. The Fund seeks to achieve strong performance relative to its peers or applicable indices through an intensive manager selection process, while risk is managed through thoughtful portfolio construction and
diversification across strategies, geographies and sectors. The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC (the “Master Fund”). The Master Fund pursues the same investment objective as the
Fund. Both the Fund and the Master Fund are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified closed-end management investment companies.  The third quarter market adjustments were likely due in Q4 2010, but delayed by last year’s QE2 operations. As a whole, 2011 played out in a very similar fashion to 2010, with one major exception: global
financial liquidity fell significantly and was not offset by central banks in any of the three major economic regions of Asia, North America or Europe. That was a warning sign that results this quarter might reveal the weakest links in the
financial system. To explain: a series of global events in each region over the last three quarters combined to squeeze global liquidity. These
events began last fall and gathered momentum and strength over the course of 2011. It started in Asia with China’s tightening measures to fight domestic inflation pressures last fall. Europe’s “inflation-phobes” introduced a
double-whammy of monetary and fiscal tightening at the same time by raising short-term rates for the first time since 2008 while the politicians demanded austerity to balance budgets of near bankrupt governments of southern Europe. In the meantime,
during much of 2011 U.S. politicians wrangled over the debt ceiling and proposed fiscal cuts and higher taxes instead of more quantitative easing. And the list goes on. Subsequently, the United States went into a current account surplus (ex-China, ex-oil), with US dollars coming home, as opposed to circulating through international trade and international banking systems, thus
confirming the draining of liquidity abroad.  All of these factors led us to bring in portfolio risk in areas most sensitive to a withdrawal of liquidity
(Europe, credit and emerging markets). We still lost money for the quarter, as our higher volatility managers, which we use for up-market capture, reinforced that they are good for down-market capture as well. The good news is that our expectation
for these managers fell into our range of expected outcomes, and we believe that their portfolio investments still offer the potential for attractive future returns.  Our goal throughout this crisis period is the same as it was 2008: protect capital while generating reasonable returns, so that we can buy cheap assets in chaos, without limiting upside in a normal market
environment. Easier to say than to implement, but it can be done. That is the magic of good hedge fund investing. Let us break apart our portfolio in those segments and highlight some of the techniques we use to do this. 
  1 


Table of Contents
“Protect capital while generating reasonable returns.” 
Technique: allocate to “all-weather” managers who we believe, regardless of the markets, will have the potential to generate solid returns. Our relative
value suite and low net, moderate gross exposure long/short equity managers serve as the primary examples. Year to date, our relative value suite has gained over 3% and our low-net long short managers are performing well. These managers are the
equivalent of a baseball player with great on-base-percentage.  “Buy cheap assets in chaos.” 
Technique: allocate to opportunistic managers skilled in distressed assets and sector specialists. These managers have lost minimal money this year. These are our
sluggers.  “Capture excess returns in normal markets”  Technique: blend skilled managers who find mispriced securities and market inefficiencies over the long term, but tend to carry market and liquidity risk. Examples are bankruptcies, complex securities, litigation
processes, soft-catalyst merger and acquisitions, value equities. We believe these managers have the potential to generate solid long-term returns, but carry more symmetric returns relative to the short-term market moves (beta). Over time, however,
they tend to capture what we call “time arbitrage”. The assets they own tend to correlate to stressed markets.  Exhibit
A: Lehman Brothers Holding Company Bonds. A current example of the time arbitrage trade is the Lehman Brothers Holding Company bonds. Although positive news came out on August 30th regarding the plan of reorganization, the bonds traded down 12% in the third quarter after being overwhelmed by macroeconomic
news and rumored selling pressure from a large fund receiving redemption requests. In addition, these bonds are so attractive that many large funds already own full positions in their portfolios, so they could not buy incremental positions. On the
valuation side, our managers believe with total recoveries, a base case return is 31%, with a low case of 21% and reasonable upside case of 44%. On June 30, 2010 the LBHI bonds traded hands at a price of 27. On January 3, 2011 they changed
hands at 25. On September 30, they traded at 23.88. With a Plan of Reorganization confirmation hearing scheduled for the first two weeks of December, and cash distributions expected in the first half of 2012, in a normalized environment, we
believe that the bonds will likely trade up as more certainty is known surrounding the bankruptcy outcome. In short, we believe this example highlights the value embedded in the portfolio that can be masked by short term volatility. 
We thank our investors as we strive to provide rewarding risk adjusted long-term returns.  Sincerely,  SCS Financial

Important Definitions and Disclosures  “Correlation” — a correlation coefficient is a measure of the interdependence of two random variables that ranges in value from -1 to +1, indicating perfect negative correlation at -1, absence of
correlation at zero, and perfect positive correlation at +1.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. 
Opinions expressed are subject to change at any time, are not guarantees and should not be considered investment advice. 
This material is not an invitation to subscribe for interests in the Fund and is by way of information only. Sales of interests shall be made on the basis of the
Fund’s Confidential Offering Memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) only and are not offered to any prospective investor who does not satisfy certain minimum financial and sophistication criteria, or in any jurisdiction in which such
offer is not authorized.  An investment in alternative investments can be highly illiquid, is speculative and not suitable for all investors. Investing
in alternative investments is only intended for experiences and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high economic risk associated with such an investment. Performance may be volatile and there is no guarantee or assurance that an
investment in the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
 Before making an investment decision, investors should consider the suitability of this investment with respect to their investment objectives and
personal situation and consider factors such as-their personal net worth, income, age, risk tolerance and liquidity needs.  An investment in the Fund,
and the underlying funds in which the Fund invests through its investment in the Master Fund (collectively, “Alternative Investment Funds”), involves risks, including the following: 
 


•
 
 Past performance of the Fund, as well as any Alternative Investment Fund in which it invests, is not indicative of future performance. The value of the
Fund’s investments will fluctuate, and there is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.   


•
 
 Investing in the Fund and the Alternative Investment Funds involves a significant degree of market risk. No assurance can be given that the strategy or
strategies utilized by the Fund or an Alternative Investment Fund will be successful under any or all future market conditions. Changes in general economic conditions may affect the profitability of the Fund or an Alternative Investment Fund or
specific strategies used by such funds.   


•
 
 An investment in an Alternative Investment Fund may be highly illiquid. Such funds are subject to lock up periods and restrictions on redemptions, including in
some cases suspensions. In addition, there is no secondary market for the interests in Alternative Investment Funds, including the Fund, and none is expected to develop. There are substantial restrictions on transferring of the interests in the
Fund.   


•
 
 Alternative Investment Funds generally are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as more conventional investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, and
involve risks not associated with more conventional investments.   


•
 
 Due to the early life-cycle of some Alternative Investment Funds, such funds may experience significant loss as a result of declines in an economic sector,
industry group, stock market or for portfolio infrastructure failure.

 The Fund and the Alternative Investment Funds in which it invests may be leveraged and may involve other speculative investment practices that may increase the
risk of investment loss. Short selling for example involves the risk of potentially unlimited increase in the market value of the security sold short, which could result in potentially unlimited losses. In addition, investments in commodities
contracts and all derivative instruments, including futures and options, involve investment exposure that may exceed the original cost and a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact in the performance of the Fund or
Alternative Investment Fund. The prices of such investments are highly volatile and they are subject to the risk of failure of any exchanges on which the positions trade or of a clearing house. 
 


•
 
 Investments in foreign securities involve greater risk, including currency risk, different accounting standards and are subject to political instability.
  


•
 
 Neither the Fund, nor the Alternative Investment Funds in which they invest, are required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors with
respect to individual investments.   


•
 
 Because of the complex nature of Alternative Investment Funds’ investments, the distribution of tax information to investors may be subject to delays, which
may result in the need to request an extension.   


•
 
 The Fund is subject to multiple layers of fees and expenses, which may offset trading profits. By investing in a fund-of-fund such as the Fund, an investor will
indirectly bear his or her share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to the fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund also bears its pro rate share of any fees or expenses incurred by the Master Fund.
 For a complete description of the investment objectives, risks (including additional risks related to certain potential Fund
investments and/or strategies such as Margin Borrowing, Arbitrage, Swap Agreements, Call and Put Options and other Hedging Transactions), as well as conflicts of interest, fees and expenses associated with an investment in the Fund please review the
relevant sections in the Fund’s Offering Memorandum which should be reviewed in its entirety prior to investment.  This document has been prepared

SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC  Notes to Financial Statements  September 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 
   
   


1.
Organization  SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC (the
“Fund”) was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 7, 2010, and commenced operations on September 1, 2010. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “1940 Act”), as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Fund’s investment objective is to seek attractive, long-term capital appreciation with volatility that is lower than that of the equity
market and returns that demonstrate a low correlation to both the equity and fixed income markets. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in the SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC (the
“Master Fund”), a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that is registered under the 1940 Act. The Master Fund pursues its investment objective by allocating its assets among a diversified group of hedge funds managed
by portfolio managers with differing styles and strategies (“Portfolio Funds”).  The financial statements of the Master Fund, including the
Schedule of Investments, are attached to this report and should be read in conjunction with the Fund’s financial statements. The percentage of the Master Fund owned by the Offshore Fund at September 30, 2011 was 66.91%. 
The Fund and Master Fund are managed by SCS Capital Management, LLC (the “Adviser”). The Adviser is a registered investment adviser with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The Fund has a Board of Directors (the “Board”) that has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the
Fund’s investment program and its management and operations. A majority of the members of the Board are not “interested persons” (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund or the Adviser. The same directors also serve as the Master
Fund’s Board.   


2.
Significant Accounting Policies  The Fund prepares its
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America. Following are the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund:  A. Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in The United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of income and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  B. Fund Expenses 
The Fund bears its own operating expenses and, through its investment in the Master Fund, its portion of the Master Fund’s operating expenses. These operating
expenses include, but are not limited to: all investment-related expenses, registration expenses, legal fees, audit and tax preparation fees and expenses, administrative and accounting expenses and fees, transfer agent fees, custody fees, costs of
insurance, fees and travel-related expenses of the Board of Directors, all costs and expenses of preparing, setting in type, printing and distributing reports and other 
  10 


Table of Contents

communications to shareholders, and such other expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board. Expenses allocated to the Fund for its indirect investments in the Portfolio Funds are
not included in the Fund’s Statement of Operations or Financial Highlights.  The Adviser and the Fund have entered into an expense limitation and
reimbursement agreement (the “Expense Limitation Agreement”) under which the Adviser has agreed to waive its fees, and/or to pay or absorb the ordinary operating expenses of the Fund (including all organization and offering expenses, as
well as the portion of the Master Fund’s fees and expenses borne by the Fund, but excluding any Portfolio Fund fees and expenses), to the extent that they exceed 2.5% per annum of the Fund’s average monthly net assets (the
“Expense Limitation”). In consideration of the Adviser’s agreement to limit the Fund’s expenses, the Fund will carry forward the amount of expenses waived, paid or absorbed by the Adviser in excess of the Expense Limitation for a
period not to exceed three years from the end of the fiscal year in which they were incurred and will reimburse the Adviser for such amounts. Reimbursement will be made as promptly as possible, but only to the extent that it does not cause the
Fund’s ordinary operating expenses to exceed the Expense Limitation. The Expense Limitation Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by the Fund. For the period ended March 31, 2011 and the six months ended September 30, 2011,
the Adviser waived expenses in the amount of $684,198 and $152,417, respectively.  C. Organizational and Offering Costs 
The Master Fund incurred organizational and offering costs. The Master Fund expensed all of its organizational costs of $250,363 in the first two months of
operations. The portion of the Master Fund’s organizational costs allocated to the Fund totaled $248,569. The Master Fund had total offering costs of $271,405, which it amortized over its first twelve months of operations, $156,111 in the
period ended March 31, 2011 and $115,294 in the six months ended September 30, 2011. The portion of the Master Fund’s offering costs allocated to the Fund in the period ended March 31, 2011 totaled $138,120 and in the six months
ended September 30, 2011 totaled $88,888.  D. Investments in the Master Fund  The Fund records its investment in the Master Fund at fair value which is represented by the Fund’s proportionate indirect interest in the net assets of the Master Fund as of September 30, 2011. Valuation
of Portfolio Funds and other investments held by the Master Fund is discussed in the notes to the Master Fund’s financial statements. The Fund records its pro rata share of the Master Fund’s income, expenses and realized and unrealized
gains and losses. The performance of the Fund is directly affected by the performance of the Master Fund. The financial statements of the Master Fund, which are attached, are an integral part of these financial statements. Please refer to the
accounting policies disclosed in the financial statements of the Master Fund for additional information regarding significant accounting policies that affect the Fund.  E. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  F. Fair Value  The fair values of the Fund’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under the Accounting Standards Codification 825, Financial Instruments, approximate the carrying amounts presented in
the statement of assets and liabilities.  G. Income Taxes  The Fund’s tax year end is December 31. The Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Each member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating to such member’s

  11 


Table of Contents

distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 
The Fund is subject to authoritative guidance related to the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under U.S. GAAP. This guidance sets forth a
minimum threshold for the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken based on the technical merits of such positions. Management is not aware of any exposure to uncertain tax positions that could require accrual. As of September 30,
2011, the Fund’s tax years since inception remain open and subject to examination by relevant taxing authorities.  H. Indemnifications
 Under the Fund’s organizational documents, its officers and directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts that provide general indemnification to other parties. The Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred, and may not occur. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
 


3.
Investment Transactions  For the six months ended
September 30, 2011, the Fund purchased (at cost) and sold interests (proceeds) of the Master Fund in the amount of $10,123,371 and $0, respectively.   


4.
Management and Performance Fees, Administration Fees and Custodian Fees  The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with SCS Capital Management, LLC. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Master Fund pays the Adviser a quarterly fee, which is calculated and
accrued monthly, (the “Advisory Fee”) at the annual rate of 1.25% of the Master Fund’s net assets. So long as substantially all of the assets of the Fund are invested in the Master Fund, the Fund does not pay the Adviser a separate
fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Fund does however, due to its investment in the Master Fund, bear its proportionate percentage of the Advisory Fee paid to the Adviser by the Master Fund. 
The Fund has engaged U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to serve as the Fund’s administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent. The Master Fund pays the
administrator a monthly fee computed at an annual rate of 0.070% of the first $150,000,000 of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets, 0.050% on the next $250,000,000 of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets and 0.030% on the
balance of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets with a minimum annual fee of $70,000. There is no fee directly attributable to the Fund other than its allocated portion of the Master Fund’s expenses. 
The Fund has engaged U.S. Bank, N.A. to serve as the Fund’s custodian. The Master Fund pays the custodian a monthly fee computed at an annual rate of 0.001% of
the Master Fund’s portfolio market value with a minimum annual fee of $5,000. There is no fee directly attributable to the Fund other than its allocated portion of the Master Fund’s expenses. 
 


5.
Directors and Officers  The Board has overall responsibility
to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund and the Master Fund, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund’s and the Master
Fund’s business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Fund and the Master 
  12 


Table of Contents

Fund as are customarily exercised by the board of directors of a registered investment company organized as a corporation. A listing of the Board members is on the back cover of this report. The
Independent Directors are each paid (in the aggregate) by the Fund and the Master Fund an annual retainer of $20,000, and per meeting fees of $5,000 in the case of regular meetings, $2,000 in the case of telephonic meetings. All Directors are
reimbursed by the Fund and the Master Fund for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Directors do not receive any pension or retirement benefits from the Fund or the Master Fund. Two of the Directors are employees of the Adviser and receive
no compensation from the Fund or Master Fund for serving as Directors.  All of the Officers of the Fund and Master Fund are affiliated with the Adviser.
Such Officers receive no compensation from the Fund or Master Fund for serving in their respective roles. The Board appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to the Company in accordance with federal securities regulations. 
 


6.
Shareholder Transactions  No shareholder will have the right
to require the Fund to redeem shares, although the Fund may from time to time repurchase shares as of the last day of a calendar quarter pursuant to written tenders by shareholders. Whether repurchases will be made during any given quarter will be
determined by the Board in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Fund should offer to repurchase shares from shareholders, the Board will consider the recommendations of the Adviser. The Adviser expects that it will generally recommend to
the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase shares on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The minimum initial investment required is $25,000. At September 30, 2011, $492,500 investor capital subscriptions were received in advance.
 The Fund had 1,380,301 shares outstanding at September 30, 2011. The Fund has issued 1,007,779 and 372,522 shares through shareholder subscriptions
during the period ended March 31, 2011 and the six months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.   


7.
Risk Factors  Because of the limitation on rights of
redemption and the fact that the Shares will not be traded on any securities exchange or other market and will be subject to substantial restrictions on transfer, and because of the fact that the Adviser may invest the Master Fund’s assets in
Portfolio Funds that do not permit frequent withdrawals and may invest in illiquid securities, an investment in the Fund is highly illiquid and involves a substantial degree of risk. Portfolio Funds are riskier than liquid securities because the
Portfolio Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates, or may be able to dispose of the illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Portfolio
Funds may cause investors to incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund during or following periods of negative performance. Although the Fund may offer to repurchase shares from time to time, there can be no
assurance such offers will be made with any regularity. The Master Fund invests primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the 1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using different
strategies and investment techniques, including leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater investment
return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Master Fund’s net
asset value. Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Fund, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Master Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to limited liquidity of the
shares. The Portfolio Funds 
  13 


Table of Contents

provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock-up provisions of up to three years from initial investment. 
 


8.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Fund has adopted
authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation
techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion in changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 
Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
risk, etc.).  Level 3 — Valuations based primarily on inputs that are unobservable and significant. The Master Fund utilized
the Portfolio Funds’ month-end NAVs as of the reporting date for fair value. The Portfolio Funds require a redemption notice, and generally include a lock-up period, which results in significant unobservable inputs as of the reporting date.
 The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of September 30, 2011;

SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC  Notes to Financial Statements  September 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 
   
 


1.
Organization  SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC (the
“Master Fund”) was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 7, 2010, and commenced operations on September 1, 2010. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Fund’s investment objective is to seek attractive, long-term capital appreciation with volatility that is lower than that of the equity
market and returns that demonstrate a low correlation to both the equity and fixed income markets. The Master Fund pursues its investment objective by allocating its assets among a diversified group of hedge funds managed by portfolio managers with
differing styles and strategies (“Portfolio Funds”).  The SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is
registered under the 1940 Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company (the “Feeder Fund”) pursues its investment objectives by investing substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Feeder Fund has the
same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies as the Master Fund (except that the Feeder Fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in the Master Fund).  The SCS Hedged Opportunities (TE) Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is registered under the 1940 Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company (the “TE Feeder
Fund”, together with the “Feeder Fund” the “Feeder Funds”) pursues its investment objectives by investing substantially all of its assets in the SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LDC (the “Offshore Fund”), a Cayman
Islands limited duration company. The Offshore Fund is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Offshore Fund in turn invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The TE Feeder Fund and Offshore
Fund have the same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies as the Master Fund (except that they pursue their investment objectives by investing in the Master Fund).  The Master Fund and Feeder Funds are managed by SCS Capital Management, LLC (the “Adviser”). The Adviser is a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The Master Fund has a Board of Directors (the “Board”) that has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the Fund’s investment program
and its management and operations. A majority of the members of the Board are not “interested persons” (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund or the Adviser. The same directors also serve as the Feeder Funds’ Board. 
 


2.
Significant Accounting Policies  The Master Fund prepares its
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America. Following are the significant accounting policies adopted by the Master Fund:  A. Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in The United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
  25 


Table of Contents

the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of income and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  B. Fund Expenses  The Master
Fund bears its own operating expenses. These operating expenses include, but are not limited to: all investment-related expenses, registration expenses, legal fees, audit and tax preparation fees and expenses, administrative and accounting expenses
and fees, transfer agent fees, custody fees, costs of insurance, fees and travel-related expenses of the Board of Directors, all costs and expenses of preparing, setting in type, printing and distributing reports and other communications to
shareholders, and such other expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board. Expenses allocated to the Master Fund for its investments in the Portfolio Funds are not included in the Master Fund’s Statement of Operations or Financial
Highlights.  C. Organizational and Offering Costs 
The Master Fund incurred organizational and offering costs. The Master Fund expensed all of its organizational costs of $250,363 in the first two months of
operations. The Master Fund had total offering costs of $271,405, which it amortized over its first twelve months of operations, $156,111 and $115,294 in the period ended March 31, 2011 and the six months ended September 30, 2011,
respectively.  D. Investments in Portfolio Funds 
In accordance with the terms of the Master Fund’s Prospectus, the investments in the Portfolio Funds are valued at their fair value. 
The Fund has the ability to liquidate its investments periodically, ranging from monthly to annually, depending on the provisions of the respective Portfolio Fund
agreements. Generally, the General Partners and/or Investment Managers of the Portfolio Funds can suspend redemptions.  Certain Portfolio Funds incur
annual management fees ranging from 1% to 2% of a Portfolio Fund’s net assets. The Portfolio Funds also receive performance allocations of up to 20% of their net profits as defined by the respective Portfolio Fund agreements. 
The Portfolio Funds in which the Fund has investments utilize a variety of financial instruments in their trading strategies including equity and debt securities,
options, futures, and swap contracts. Several of these financial instruments contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk, whereby changes in fair value of the securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the amounts
recorded on each of the Portfolio Fund’s balance sheets. In addition, the Portfolio Funds may sell securities short whereby a liability is created to repurchase the security at prevailing prices. Such Portfolio Funds’ ultimate obligations
to satisfy the sale of securities sold short may exceed the amount recognized on their balance sheets. However, due to the nature of the Master Fund’s interest in the Portfolio Funds, such risks are limited to the Master Fund’s invested
amount in each investee.  Of the Portfolio Funds listed on the Schedule of Investments, 9 were acquired during the period and 14 remained subject to
lock-up periods expiring in one to three years from their respective purchase dates. Of these investments, 8 can be redeemed prior to the lock-up period for a penalty ranging from 1% to 5% of the redemption amount. 
E. Investment Valuation  The Master Fund primarily invests
in private Portfolio Funds that are not listed on a securities exchange. Prior to investing in any Portfolio Fund, the Adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the Portfolio Fund. 
 
  26 


Table of Contents
The Master Fund’s valuation procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant information available at the
time the Master Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board will consider such information, and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by a Portfolio Fund manager does not represent the fair value of the
Company’s interests in that Portfolio Fund. Although redemptions of interests in Portfolio Funds are subject to advance notice requirements, Portfolio Funds typically will make available net asset value information to holders representing the
price at which, even in the absence of redemption activity, a Portfolio Fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if, in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Fund’s governing documents, it would be
necessary to effect a mandatory redemption. Following procedures adopted by the Board, in the absence of specific transaction activity in interests in a particular Portfolio Fund, the Master Fund would consider whether it was appropriate, in light
of all relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as reported at the time of valuation, or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to net asset value. For example, when a Portfolio Fund imposes
extraordinary restrictions on redemptions, or when there have been no recent transactions in Portfolio Fund interests, the Adviser may determine that it is appropriate to apply such a discount. Any such decision would be made in good faith, and
subject to the review and supervision of the Board.  The Adviser assesses the accuracy of each Portfolio Fund’s reported monthly net asset value
using various means. These may include comparing a reported valuation with one or more strategy-specific benchmarks that the Adviser believes correlate with the strategy of the Portfolio Fund; discussing the performance of the Portfolio Fund with
the manager’s personnel; or reviewing and analyzing the Portfolio Fund’s audited financial statements.  The valuations reported by the
Portfolio Funds’ managers, upon which the Master Fund calculates its month-end net asset value and net asset value per share may be subject to later adjustment, based on information reasonably available at that time. For example, fiscal
year-end net asset value calculations of the Portfolio Funds are audited by those Portfolio Funds’ independent public accountants, during their respective fiscal year end, and may be revised as a result of such audits. Other adjustments may
occur from time to time. To the extent these adjustments materially impact the Master Fund’s net asset value, management will appropriately adjust participants’ transactions to ensure they are not materially harmed. 
F. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents
include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  G. Fair Value 
The fair values of the Master Fund’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under the Accounting Standards Codification 825, Financial
Instruments, approximate the carrying amounts presented in the statement of assets and liabilities.  H. Income Taxes 
The Master Fund’s tax year end is December 31. The Master Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Each member is responsible for
the tax liability or benefit relating to such member’s distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 
The Master Fund is subject to authoritative guidance related to the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under U.S. GAAP. This guidance sets forth a
minimum threshold for the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken based on the technical merits of such positions. 
  27 


Table of Contents

Management is not aware of any exposure to uncertain tax positions that could require accrual. As of September 30, 2011, the Master Fund’s tax years since inception remain open and
subject to examination by relevant taxing authorities.  I. Indemnifications  Under the Master Fund’s organizational documents, its officers and directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund may enter into contracts that provide general indemnification to other parties. The Master Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Master Fund that have not yet occurred, and may not occur. However, the Master Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
 


3.
Investment Transactions  For the six months ended
September 30, 2011, the Master Fund purchased (at cost) and sold interests (proceeds) in Portfolio Funds in the amount of $22,835,985 and $1,435,985 (excluding short-term securities), respectively. The Master Fund purchased (at cost) and sold
interests (proceeds) in investment securities in the amount of $165,428 and $0 (excluding short-term securities), respectively.   


4.
Management and Performance Fees, Administration Fees and Custodian Fees  The Master Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with SCS Capital Management, LLC. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Master Fund pays the Adviser a quarterly fee, which is calculated and
accrued monthly, (the “Advisory Fee”) at the annual rate of 1.25% of the Master Fund’s net assets.  The Master Fund has engaged U.S.
Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to serve as the Master Fund’s administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent. The Master Fund pays the administrator a monthly fee computed at an annual rate of 0.070% of the first $150,000,000 of the Master
Fund’s total monthly net assets, 0.050% on the next $250,000,000 of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets and 0.030% on the balance of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets with a minimum annual fee of $70,000. 
The Master Fund has engaged U.S. Bank, N.A. to serve as the Master Fund’s custodian. The Master Fund pays the custodian a monthly fee computed at an annual
rate of 0.001% of the Master Fund’s portfolio market value with a minimum annual fee of $5,000.   


5.
Directors and Officers  The Board has overall responsibility
to manage and control the business affairs of the Master Fund and the Feeder Funds, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Master Fund’s and the
Feeder Funds’ business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Master Fund and the Feeder Funds as are customarily exercised by the board of directors of a registered investment company organized as
a corporation. A listing of the Board members is on the back cover of this report. The Independent Directors are each paid (in the aggregate) by the Master Fund an annual retainer of $20,000, and per meeting fees of $5,000 in the case of regular
meetings, $2,000 in the case of telephonic meetings. All Directors are reimbursed by the Master Fund for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Directors do not receive any pension or retirement benefits

  28 


Table of Contents

from the Master Fund or the Feeder Funds. Two of the Directors are employees of the Adviser and receive no compensation from the Master Fund or Feeder Funds for serving as Directors. 
All of the Officers of the Master Fund and Feeder Funds are affiliated with the Adviser. Such Officers receive no compensation from the Master Fund or Feeder Funds
for serving in their respective roles. The Board appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to the Company in accordance with federal securities regulations.   


6.
Shareholder Transactions  The Master Fund from time to time
may offer to repurchase Interests pursuant to written tenders by Investors. Any such repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its complete and exclusive discretion. In determining
whether the Master Fund should repurchase Interests or portions thereof from Investors pursuant to written tenders, the Board will consider the recommendation of the Adviser. The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the
Master Fund offer to repurchase Interests from Investors, on a quarterly basis, on or about March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st of each year.  The Master Fund had 2,110,651 shares outstanding at September 30, 2011. The Master Fund has issued 1,256,681 and 853,970 shares through shareholder subscriptions during the period ended March 31, 2011 and
the six months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.   


7.
Risk Factors  Because of the limitation on rights of
redemption and the fact that the Shares will not be traded on any securities exchange or other market and will be subject to substantial restrictions on transfer, and because of the fact that the Adviser may invest the Master Fund’s assets in
Portfolio Funds that do not permit frequent withdrawals and may invest in illiquid securities, an investment in the Master Fund is highly illiquid and involves a substantial degree of risk. Portfolio Funds are riskier than liquid securities because
the Portfolio Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates, or may be able to dispose of the illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Portfolio
Funds may cause investors to incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Master Fund during or following periods of negative performance. Although the Master Fund may offer to repurchase shares from time to time,
there can be no assurance such offers will be made with any regularity. The Master Fund invests primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the 1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using
different strategies and investment techniques, including leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater
investment return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Master
Fund’s net asset value. Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Master Fund, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Master Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to
limited liquidity of the shares. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock-up provisions of up to three years from initial investment. 
 


8.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Master Fund has
adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and
valuation techniques used to develop the 
  29 


Table of Contents

measurements of fair value and a discussion in changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
 Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 
Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
risk, etc.).  Level 3 — Valuations based primarily on inputs that are unobservable and significant. The Master Fund utilized
the Portfolio Funds’ month-end NAVs as of the reporting date for fair value. The Portfolio Funds require a redemption notice, and generally include a lock-up period, which results in significant unobservable inputs as of the reporting date.
 The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Master Fund’s investments as of September 30, 2011;
