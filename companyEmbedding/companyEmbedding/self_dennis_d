 Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body Review      
   Home10 Best Self TannersAll ReviewsBlogHow To Self Tan You are here: Home » Self Tanning Reviews » Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body ReviewDr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body ReviewReview of: Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for BodyReviewed by: Emily AndrewsRating:3On Last modified:Summary:Comprehensive review of Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body.  See what real experts and actual users have to say about this self tanning product.Product Name:  Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for BodyOverall Rating:  Product Type: Pad/towelettesSize: 8 towelettesPrice:  $45.00Cost Per Ounce:  $5.63 per toweletteWhere To Buy:  Click HereTop 10 Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethoxydiglycol, Dihydroxyacetone, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Larrea Divaricata Extract, Caffeine, Ascorbyl Palmitate Overall Opinion:I’ve tried many self tanners, and one trend I’ve noticed is that most tanning “wipes” are more for convenience, rather than achieving a deep tan.Most wipes I’ve tried have produced a color that’s almost non-existent.  So that’s what I was expecting when I tried Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body.I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up with a smooth, light to medium shade tan.  I actually looked about 2 shades darker which is more than I can say for other tanning wipes.There were a few things I didn’t like about these though.  For one, the price is outrageous!  One box of 8 wipes sells for $45.00, that works out to $5.63 per wipe.  And then you need to take into account that you’ll use more than one wipe each time you tan.  So it ends up being a pricey tan.I also didn’t like how long these took to dry once I applied them.It took a good 30-40 minutes for me to feel dry enough to crawl into bed.  I actually woke up in the middle of the night feeling like my legs were sticking to each other….so I don’t feel like that “sticky” feeling ever really went away.These wipes not only give you a nice glow, but they also claim to help smooth your skin and “minimize shaving”.I noticed my skin looked smooth and even, but I didn’t notice any effect on shaving at all.I do like how they added in ingredients that are good for your skin, along with the DHA to give you a tan.These pads smelled nice, produced a nice color and are SO convenient and easy to apply….so I gave them 3 out of 5 stars.Detailed Opinion:Look and FeelDr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pads for Body are large, pre moistened wipes.I liked these because they are huge, so you don’t need to use 5 of them for your whole body…I only used 2.I also liked that these are pretty wet compared to other wipes, they don’t dry out easily and there is enough product on them to cover a big area.The towelettes are white, there is no guide in them.ApplicationApplying these pads was very easy.  There is no dark guide, so these aren’t messy at all.You also don’t need to wear a glove while applying these.You just wipe down your entire body with the towelette (it takes under 3 minutes), and then you’re done!Like I mentioned earlier, these towelettes and more soaked then other wipes I’ve tried, so one wipe will cover almost half your body which is nice.I used one wipe on my upper body and one wipe on my lower body, which worked nicely.Drying TimeMost wipes/towelettes dry pretty quickly (in under 10 minutes).Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case with these.  The product stayed relatively sticky on my skin for 35-40 minutes.I even woke up in the middle of the night noting that my legs felt sticky when they touched each other.So, I didn’t like that part, I wish these had dried quicker and didn’t have that sticky feeling.Smell (Before Application)Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pads for Body smelled pretty good.You can smell some DHA in there, but they did a good job covering it up with a citrus, perfume smell.I liked the citrus smell, it was very light and girly.  I just wish I couldn’t smell the DHA in there.Smell (After Several Hours And The Next Day)The next morning, all smells were gone.  I couldn’t smell anything at all.The scent of these is very light, so I think it faded away overnight.Color ProducedMost towelettes produce a very light tan, so thats what I was expecting from Dr Dennis Gross Alpa Beta Glow Pads.After one use I had a light-medium shade tan.  I liked the way my tan looked, it was light but it was smooth and natural looking.You guys all know how dark I like to be, so personally I’d use these more as a tan extender.  But I know many of you out there like a lighter tan, and these produce a really nice color.These claim to “smooth bumpy skin, and minimize shaving” as well.  I definitely didn’t see them minimize shaving, I needed to shave just as often.But they did make my legs look very smooth and bump free.These include AHA which exfoliates your skin and helps the appearance.I like that they made them good for your skin, but you’ll have to apply these every other day or so to maintain your color.How Long It LastsMy tan didn’t last too long, I’d say about 2-3 days.You’ll have to apply these about 3 times a week to keep your tan.As the color faded I got a little bit splotchy, but nothing too bad.OK For Men?Yes, I think men would like these.The application is as easy as it gets, and the color is a natural light shade.If you’re looking for a darker tan I don’t think men will like these, but if you’re looking for a subtle tan these work great.PriceThese are verrryyy pricey.The box of 8 sells for $45.00, which makes each towelette $5.63.  Talk about expensive!So if you use 2 towelettes, every time you tan is over $11.00.And I’d say one box will last you about 2-4 weeks if you are actively maintaining your tan.That’s almost as much as having a monthly spray tanning membership!Where To BuyTo buy Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body, Click Here.Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pad for Body:  SummaryFactorDr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta

Exceeded My Expectation

I am 60 years old with gray hair.  My life is not slowing down.  The fact that I can start the cleansing process before I get in the shower is a time saver, if that wasn't enough; styling was a breeze.  I couldn't believe how silky and manageable it left my hair.  Couldn't stop touching it.

Wonderful! Please make in chocolate if possible.

Love this product and the scent. I have fine blonde color treated hair. This is a wonderful product. It soaks right in. I have tried the cream as well however I don't feel it penetrates the hair as well as the foam. Quick tip: I have oily scalp and dry hair. I find it best to use this product as instructed prior to washing my hair. After the first rinse I use a couple of drops of natural health food store shampoo to the scalp only just to soak up the oil. Then I proceed with the second application. Is it possible to make the foam in a chocolate scent as well?

Love this...Love my hair

This shampoo-conditioner-detangler is the best I have ever used. As I age, my hair is thinning somewhat so each time I have a tangle, the hair breaks or comes out. Not fun for a woman. I originally purchased this in the jar but I like the cleansing foam better. It smells delicious too. It is very unusual for me to be able to comb through my hair after I washed it without hairloss. Twead-d made all the difference.   My hair remains silky and shinny too.   Not to mention how nice it smells.  I hope HSN carries this product forever. Don't want to be without it.
