Code of Conduct
Responsible Investing

Overview
Direct Engagement Activities
Collaborative Initiatives
Proxy Voting





As a long-term investor, PSP Investments believes in the importance of establishing strong governance oversight of its investments. PSP Investments uses its ownership positions to promote good corporate governance practices  by exercising its proxy voting rights and actively engaging with companies individually and through collaborative initiatives with other like-minded institutional investors. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Considerations
PSP Investments recognizes that a broad range of financial and non-financial considerations are relevant in terms of making investment decisions. PSP Investments has adopted a Responsible Investment Policy that embodies its belief that responsible corporate behaviour with respect to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can have a positive influence on long-term financial performance. In analyzing the risks inherent in any investment, PSP Investments undertakes to identify, monitor and mitigate ESG issues which are or could become material to long-term financial performance. These risks are discussed in the business plans of PSP Investments’ various asset classes. They are considered part of the due-diligence process and addressed in each investment recommendation submitted to the Board of Directors’ Investment Committee, the President and CEO, or other approving officers. The monitoring of ESG risks is also part of an ongoing dialogue with external managers, Boards of Directors and senior management of the private and public companies in which PSP Investments invests.
Direct Engagement Activities
With the assistance of a service provider, PSP Investments actively engages in direct dialogue with public companies to improve their ESG practices. Public companies are selected for engagement based on a process that takes into account such factors as ability to create shareholder value, prospects for successful engagement and relevant ESG issues. The intensity of PSP Investments’ involvement with public companies evolves over time. Some engagements entail one or two meetings over a period of months; others are more complex and warrant multiple meetings with board members and senior management over several years. PSP Investments tracks its engagement objectives primarily on issues for which it believes changes in behaviour are justified.
Proxy Voting
PSP Investments has adopted Proxy Voting Guidelines to address issues of corporate governance on which it may be requested to vote from time to time, as well as the principles on which it will rely in determining a response to such requests. PSP Investments will give due consideration to corporate governance principles when assessing the merits of an issue and will exercise its voting rights with a view to maximizing the value of its shareholdings. As part of the active management of its proxy voting, PSP Investments reviews proxy circulars and research from service providers when voting the equities held in accounts managed internally, as well as those in segregated accounts managed by external managers.

Overview

Code of Conduct
Responsible Investing




PSP Investments is a Crown corporation which operates at arm’s length from the Government of Canada. Its governance framework is outlined in the Public Sector Pension Investment Board Act and includes its mandate, the responsibilities of its Board of Directors and its accountability to the Government and to its contributors.
Mandate
PSP Investments’ mandate is twofold:

Manage the funds transferred to it by the Government of Canada for the Public Service, the Canadian Armed Forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Reserve Force pension plans (the “Pension Plans”) in the best interests of the contributors and beneficiaries.

Invest its assets with a view to achieving a maximum rate of return without undue risk of loss, having regard to the funding, policies and requirements of the Pension Plans and their ability to meet their financial obligations. 

Duties and Responsibilities of our Board of Directors
PSP Investments’s operations and activities are overseen by a Board of Directors composed of 11 members. The Board adopts, amends and repeals by-laws governing the conduct and management of PSP Investments' business and affairs and prescribes the duties and responsibilities for all facets of the administration and operations of PSP Investments. It is also responsible for the selection, appointment, performance evaluation and compensation of the President and CEO, who reports to the Board of Directors. 
The  Terms of Reference describing the respective duties and responsibilities of the  Board, its committees and the Chair of the Board are approved by the Board and reviewed  on a regular basis. The Terms of Reference can be found in the Board of Directors section of this website. 
Accountability and Reporting 
PSP Investments  reports to the ministers responsible for the Pension Plans through its  quarterly financial statements and annual report. The annual report must also  be made available to contributors to the Pension Plans and is tabled in each  House of Parliament by the President of the Treasury Board.
The President and CEO, and the Chair of the Board are required to meet  once a year with advisory committees appointed to oversee the Pension Plans. PSP Investments is also required to hold an annual public meeting. In  addition, we communicate on an ongoing basis with the Chief Actuary of Canada,  Treasury Board officials and other Government of Canada officials in the  execution of our statutory mandate.
Pursuant to the Financial  Administration Act (FAA), PSP Investments must undergo a yearly external audit. The Auditor General of Canada and Deloitte LLP serve as our joint external auditors   and are also responsible for conducting Special  Examinations at least once every 10 years. The last Special Examination was performed in fiscal year 2011; its report is available  in the News Room section of this website.

Strive for Excellence
At PSP Investments, excellence is achieved through a commitment to lifelong learning and attention to detail. It is our aspiration to be the best in the world at what we do, both individually and collectively. 

Delegate Responsibility and Embrace Empowerment
Our objective is to get decisions made where expertise resides through accountability at all levels. Empowerment means pushing obstacles aside, generating options and executing on the best choice among them.  
Act with Integrity
Acting with integrity means doing what is right. At PSP Investments, it also means keeping our word. Keeping our promises establishes a high level of respect among employees within our organization, as well as for PSP Investments in the marketplace. 
Act as One Team
To “Act as one team” means to cooperate and draw on our collective infrastructure of support and ideas. It refers to building on each other’s skills and pooling expertise. It requires a commitment to learn what is needed to work together and to develop the trust to depend on each other. 
Be Results Driven
To “Be results driven” at PSP Investments means to focus on effectively and efficiently achieving our objectives and fulfilling our mandate, while upholding all of our core organizational values.

PRESS RELEASE
CHARLOTTE, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–AmWINS Group, Inc. (“AmWINS”), announced today that its shareholders have reached a definitive agreement to partner with Dragoneer Investment Group (“Dragoneer”). In this transaction, which values AmWINS at approximately $2.6 billion, New Mountain Capital (“New Mountain”) will successfully exit its investment in AmWINS, which it made in 2012. Upon completion, Dragoneer will own 35% of AmWINS, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (“PSP Investments”) will own 30% and more than 440 AmWINS employee shareholders will own the remaining 35%. Other terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., AmWINS is a leading specialty insurance broker placing in excess of $13 billion in premiums through its relationships with more than 20,000 retail brokerage firms and over 1,000 insurance markets. AmWINS’ expertise covers a wide range of specialty insurance products and services in the property/casualty and group benefits insurance marketplace. With over 3,900 employees in more than 100 offices located across 12 countries, AmWINS’ deep industry knowledge and capabilities, extensive geographic reach, and independent relationships with insurance carriers and retail insurance brokers allow it to serve as a critical, independent intermediary in the complex and highly fragmented specialty insurance market. 





“With this transaction, we have achieved yet another phase in building a long-term capital base,” said M. Steven DeCarlo, CEO of AmWINS. “Dragoneer’s investment philosophy, deep expertise in the technology industry, and global investment experience, combined with our employee ownership, positions us to be able to focus on our clients and enhances our ability to execute on our 150-year strategic vision. We also want to thank New Mountain for being a great partner over the past four years.”
“We are delighted to meaningfully increase our stake in AmWINS following our initial investment in 2015,” said Marc Stad, Founder and Managing Partner of Dragoneer. “I have personally followed AmWINS’ success for over 10 years and firmly believe there is tremendous opportunity ahead as technology plays a bigger role in the business and the company expands its independent distribution platform. AmWINS’ exceptional management team and competitive differentiation in the insurance industry align well with our investment philosophy. We look forward to forging a long-term partnership.”
The transaction completes the successful partnership between AmWINS and New Mountain. “We are very pleased with our investment in AmWINS,” said Robert Mulcare, Director at New Mountain Capital. “We are fortunate to have had the opportunity to partner with such a unique company, its outstanding management team, and its talented and dedicated employees. During the past four years the value of the company has more than doubled, and we believe the company will continue its tremendous growth and success into the future. We would like to thank the AmWINS team for their partnership.” 





“We welcome Dragoneer’s increased investment in AmWINS. Dragoneer shares our vision of providing long-term ownership to AmWINS and we look forward to collaborating with them and AmWINS’ management and employees to support the company’s continued success,” said Guthrie Stewart, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Private Investments at PSP Investments.
Subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close within the next two months. Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson served as legal adviser to AmWINS.

Pension Investments













      Pension Investments    

Public sector pension systems invest contributions to hedge against future risk and to strengthen their promise to deliver retirement benefits to plan participants. Traditional pension investments fall into the classes of equities, fixed income and cash. Some pension systems have sought to invest in alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, real estate, and real assets to diversify, which carries greater risk than traditional pension investments.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
