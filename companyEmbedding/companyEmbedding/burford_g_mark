Product Safety, Quality, and Performance Certification Marks
Certification marks are evidence that a product conforms to applicable standards, and that there is a program of ongoing factory inspections. For more than 100 years, Intertek has guided its clients through the challenging certification process, making it faster, simpler and more efficient.

In most markets, conformity to local requirements is mandatory before products can be sold. In other instances, it can be a powerful marketing tool that helps build confidence throughout distribution and end-user channels. Our global Marks and Certifications include:ASTABEAB Approved MarkBEAB Care MarkCB SchemeCCC MarkCE MarkENEC MarkETL-EU MarkETL Listed MarkETL Sanitation MarkETL Verified MarkGreen Leaf MarkGS MarkGulf Mark ("G" Mark)NOM MarkProduct Conformity for Exports to Saudi ArabiaManagement Systems Auditing and CertificationQuality and Performance MarkHealth and Environmental ServicesS MarkTick MarkWarnock Hersey (WH) MarkFood Safety and Quality Certification MarksVOC / VOC+ Indoor Air Quality CertificationExporter and Importer ServicesIntertek can help you comply with export and import requirements, ensuring smooth customs clearance of your products.

Burford is a font family that was sketched while traveling through Europe. During my time in Amsterdam, I found myself spending 2-3 hours per day sketching characters inspired by all the incredible typography I had seen. Back in the states I digitalized Burford and decided it would make a beautiful layer-based font. 
Burford Pro package was created for users who work with premiere design programs (Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, etc.) The pack comes with all 18 layering fonts including 5 base layers, 3 top layers, 5 bottom layers and 2 sets of graphic elements. They are strategically made to build on top of each other, creating a cohesive and easy-to-use layer-based family. Each font also comes with a set of Stylistic Alternatives for letters A C E F G H P Q R. You can access these using using the Opentype Panel (WINDOW - TYPE - OPENTYPE) and pressing the button 'aa'. The Pro pack includes webfonts as well.
The Burford Extras set uses all basic keyboard characters - around 100 total elements per set. They are designed to go specifically with Burford and complement its varying styles perfectly. The set includes: banners, borders, corners, arrows, line breaks, catchwords, anchors and many more!
For users who do not use premiere design programs, please check out the Burford Basic pack which includes every font file that doesn't require a layering effect.
The font pack is extremely multilingual, including alphabets for Cyrillic, Catalan, Cornish, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Macedonian, Polish, Portugese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and many more!
Check out the new BURFORD RUSTIC Family, a worn and weathered version of Burford, but with the same layering styles and features. https://creativemarket.com/KimmyDesign/238633-Burford-Rustic-Pro-60-0FF

Hi @Nicasiri Design, my apologies, I fixed the image above to reflect the cost. Currently right now the Burford Rustic pack is on a introductory promotional sale, but Burford Pro is not.

Nicasiri Design

Hi, it's being advertised at 75% off, but when I try and pay it doesn't give the discount?

I purchased the pack, but for some reason the base font and 2 or 3 others either don't show up in my menu or if they do, they substitute a different font. all the rest work fine. ANy ideas?

Steve Krantzman
Purchased 
Not only a great looking font, but being able to layer to create unlimited options is awesome.  The amount of time I can save using this font is more than worth the price.
