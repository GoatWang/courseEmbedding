	Welcome - CKX Lands, Inc.

Welcome to CKX Lands, Inc.

                CKX Lands, Inc. is a Louisiana corporation organized in 1930 as Calcasieu Real Estate & Oil Co., Inc., to receive 
                non-producing mineral royalties spun off by a southwest Louisiana bank. Over the years, as some of the royalties 
                yielded oil and gas income, the Company used the proceeds to purchase land. On May 17, 2005, the Company changed its 
                name from Calcasieu Real Estate & Oil Co., Inc. to CKX Lands, Inc. The primary reason for the change was to help 
                clarify that the Company is not directly involved in oil and gas exploration or operations. As used herein, 
                the "Company" or "CKX" refers to CKX Lands, Inc.
            

                The Company owns land and mineral interests and collects income through its ownership in the form of oil and gas 
                royalties, surface leases for farming, right of way and other uses, and timber sales. The Company is not involved 
                in the exploration or production of oil and gas nor does it actively farm its lands or manage its timber. These activities are performed by others for royalties and management fees.
            

                CKX Lands, Inc.'s office is located at 1508 Hodges Street, Lake Charles, LA 70601. Our phone number is (337) 493-2399 
                and our email is admin@ckxlands.com.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Welcome to CKX Lands, Inc.

                CKX Lands, Inc. is a Louisiana corporation organized in 1930 as Calcasieu Real Estate & Oil Co., Inc., to receive 
                non-producing mineral royalties spun off by a southwest Louisiana bank. Over the years, as some of the royalties 
                yielded oil and gas income, the Company used the proceeds to purchase land. On May 17, 2005, the Company changed its 
                name from Calcasieu Real Estate & Oil Co., Inc. to CKX Lands, Inc. The primary reason for the change was to help 
                clarify that the Company is not directly involved in oil and gas exploration or operations. As used herein, 
                the "Company" or "CKX" refers to CKX Lands, Inc.
            

                The Company owns land and mineral interests and collects income through its ownership in the form of oil and gas 
                royalties, surface leases for farming, right of way and other uses, and timber sales. The Company is not involved 
                in the exploration or production of oil and gas nor does it actively farm its lands or manage its timber. These activities are performed by others for royalties and management fees.
            

                CKX Lands, Inc.'s office is located at 1508 Hodges Street, Lake Charles, LA 70601. Our phone number is (337) 493-2399 
                and our email is admin@ckxlands.com.
