Extreme Networks Provides Update on its Acquisition of Brocade's Data Center Networking Business
PR Newswire






SAN JOSE, Calif., July 18, 2017


 SAN JOSE, Calif., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Extreme Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXTR) today provided an update regarding its acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.'s ("Brocade") data center networking business from Broadcom Corporation ("Broadcom"). Today, in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Brocade announced the delay of the closing of its anticipated acquisition by Broadcom. The parties agreed to re-file their joint voluntary notice to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS"). Brocade stated it now expects to close during its fourth fiscal quarter ending October 28, 2017.  

  

At this time, Extreme expects to close its transaction with Broadcom within 2-3 business days of the completed acquisition of Brocade by Broadcom. "As we march toward becoming the third largest end-to-end enterprise networking provider, we are confident our acquisition of Brocade's data center networking business will move forward," said Ed Meyercord, President and CEO of Extreme Networks. "Last Friday, we closed our acquisition of Avaya's networking business and the response from customers, partners and our new employees is very positive. The delay will provide us with additional time to integrate Avaya operations and prepare for our business combination with Brocade. We are working to ensure a smooth transition for new and existing employees, customers and partners from both Avaya and Brocade."
Extreme expects the anticipated Brocade transaction will be accretive to cash flow and earnings for its fiscal year 2018 and expects to generate over $230 million in annualized revenue from the acquired assets.

How Risky Is Extreme Networks, Inc.?
The network equipment company is building a much larger and more complete beast through a basket of pending acquisitions.











                Anders Bylund
            

                (TMFZahrim)



            
            Jul 9, 2017 at 8:14AM
            
            





Shares of Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) have soared 166% higher over the last 52 weeks, including a 79% gain in 2017 alone. Is the networking equipment provider's stock getting too hot to handle, or do Extreme's shares truly belong at these higher altitudes?
Let's find out.

Extreme's rise
This is one of those overnight sensations that were years in the making.
Extreme has been building a complete portfolio of networking solutions by way of many small but needle-moving acquisitions. The company you see today includes networking operations that formerly were part of industry giants such as Siemens, Motorola, Nortel, and Cabletron Systems.
Right now, Extreme is looking to close a $100 million buyout of Avaya's networking division, followed by a still-pending agreement to shoulder Brocade Communications Systems' (NASDAQ:BRCD) data center networking operations for $55 million. The Brocade buyout is part of the closing conditions for a larger deal, as semiconductor titan Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is picking up the rest of Brocade for a cool $5.5 billion.





When the dust settles around the Avaya and Brocade transactions, Extreme hopes to gain a total of $430 million in annual revenues from the two new assets. Both deals are also expected to deliver positive operating earnings and cash flows from day one. Piece by piece, Extreme Networks is joining a very select group of companies with a top-to-bottom portfolio of enterprise networking solutions. From Ethernet and coaxial cable to wireless and cloud computing, "The New Extreme" can do it all.
What's next?
The Brocade and Avaya deals are set to expand Extreme's annual sales by a staggering 77%. Neither one of those acquisitions has actually closed yet, so investors need to keep a close eye on that progress. There's no reason to believe that these game-changing buyouts will fail, but uncertainty is next to business risk.
And there seems to be plenty of risk baked into Extreme's share prices at the moment. Despite the massive share prices gains I noted earlier, the stock trades at just 19 times forward earnings and 23 times trailing free cash flows. Assuming that the post-merger version of Extreme should be able to reap cross-selling and cost-cutting synergies from its newfound economies of scale, well, these ratios are starting to look mighty low. Market makers don't like sources of uncertainty like unsigned buyout deals.
So I don't see a ton of valuation risk here, and the execution risk is also relatively low when you consider Extreme's long history of successful buyout deals. The company fell out of favor a few years ago, when it still focused on old-school Ethernet networking, but the acquisition strategy has already turned Extreme in a whole new direction.





There's no such thing as a risk-free investment, but having Extreme Networks in your portfolio should not make you lose sleep or send you on a fidget-spinner buying spree. It's actually a good-looking investment idea right about now.

        Extreme Networks Closes Avaya Acquisition        
Extreme Networks CEO emphasizes his confidence that he can succeed where Avaya failed.

Extreme Networks closed on its acquisition of networking assets from Avaya this week. Extreme emerged as the winning bidder for Avaya's enterprise networking business unit in a deal valued at $100 million. Avaya had itself acquired the enterprise networking business from Nortel Networks for $900 million in December 2009.

In a webinar detailing the how the newly combined assets from Avaya would be integrated with Extreme Networking, CEO Ed Meyercord emphasized that the plan was to have as little disruption as possible for clients.
Meyercord recounted that it was just over a year ago that he had his first conversation with Avaya CEO Kevin Kennedy about the networking assets. Kennedy told Meyercord that the networking business was a solid area, to which Meyercord retorted asking if that was the case, why was Avaya selling it?
Meyercord said that Kennedy noted that the problem at Avaya is focus and much of the company's efforts have been in Unified Communications and not networking.




In contrast Meyercord emphasized that Extreme is all about networking.
"We're really excited to be focused on networking," Meyercord said. "This is our sweet spot and this is all that we're doing and we're focused."
With bringing on Avaya's technology, Meyercord said that Extreme Networks will now have over 3,000 employees and well over 30,000 customers. The plan is to have all of the existing Avaya products become Extreme product, with new branding to roll out as new devices are built.
Dan Dulac, VP of Product Management and Marketing at Extreme Networks detailed a comprehensive roadmap of innovations that the combined company is planning over the remainder of 2017.
Among the new product set to debut is the VSP 8600 which is an extension of the popular Virtual Services switching platform from Avaya. Extreme's X690 high-density 10/100G switch is also set for an update in September 2017 providing more power to customers.
Extreme also plans on updating its ExtremeCloud management solution to provide integrated wired and wireless cloud management of networking gear from both Avaya and Extreme.
The other big item on Extreme Networks roadmap is the acquisition of data center networking assets from Brocade in a deal valued at $55 million that was first announced in March 2017, but has not yet closed.

Extreme Networks Inc. plans to lean on its recently acquired Avaya fabric software to provide centralized management and control of large wired and wireless campus networks.








Extreme released this week a product roadmap for the rest of the year that encompasses the software and hardware of both companies. Late last week, Extreme completed the acquisition of the networking business of Avaya Inc., which sold the unit as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
In November, Extreme plans to add Avaya's Fabric Attach technology to its campus wireless products, which include controllers and access points, and to switches running the company's ExtremeXOS network operating system, executives said in an online webinar aimed at Avaya customers and partners. The vendor also plans to add Fabric Attach to the Extreme Management Center.
Fabric Attach is an extension of Avaya's Fabric Connect, which enables simpler provisioning, management and troubleshooting of switches. Fabric Connect was Avaya's software-defined networking product. It is supported in many of Avaya's campus and data center switches, which Extreme acquired.
Fabric Attach extends automatic provisioning to non-Avaya switches and endpoints, including wireless LAN access points. An agent is deployed on the devices, so they can receive the configurations from the Avaya Fabric Connect system.
In September, Extreme plans to release 802.11ac Wave 2 access points under a new brand, called Superspec. Also, the company will release version 4.11 of ExtremeCloud, the company's cloud-based network management software for small and midsize wired and wireless LANs built on Extreme technology.

Avaya customers as important as technology
Besides technology, Extreme's acquisition of Avaya's networking business brought a customer base that Extreme wants to hold. The company plans to keep those customers by honoring all Avaya contracts and continuing to support and service all products.
Catering to Avaya customers is important because Extreme would have had difficulty acquiring them on its own, given the maturity of the networking market, said Jim Duffy, an analyst at 451 Research. "It's more of a customer grab than any benefit from the Avaya technology."



    I don't see them taking any Cisco share, I don't see them taking any HPE share, and I don't see them taking any Huawei share.

Indeed, Extreme has been growing its customer base through a buying spree that started in September 2016 with the $55 million acquisition of Zebra Technologies' WLAN business. Extreme announced the $100 million Avaya acquisition in mid-March of this year, roughly two weeks before agreeing to buy Brocade's data center business from Broadcom, also for $55 million. The Brocade portfolio includes switches, routers, and network automation and analytics software.
Extreme's combined revenue from the acquisitions will reach about $1 billion, according to the company. However, Duffy said he is skeptical the company will be able to grow much larger, given that Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Huawei and other rivals have similar products. 
"I don't see them taking any Cisco share, I don't see them taking any HPE share, and I don't see them taking any Huawei share," he said.  Also, Extreme still has to effectively integrate all the technologies it has acquired and demonstrate that it can hold onto the new customers.


Brocade deal delayed
Extreme also has to complete the Brocade acquisition, which hit a snag with government regulators this week. Brocade, which sold itself to Broadcom last year for $5.9 billion, has yet to win approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. CFIUS reviews the national security implications of a foreign entity acquiring a U.S. business. Broadcom has headquarters in Irvine, Calif., and Singapore.

At CFIUS's request, Brocade and Broadcom have refiled for a 30-day review, which the agency could extend for an additional 45 days. Brocade said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that there are "no assurances" CFIUS would approve the deal.
CFIUS nixing the transaction would stop Extreme's plans for Brocade. Nevertheless, Extreme is optimistic and believes it can complete the deal by Oct. 28, Extreme CEO Ed Meyercord said during the webinar. Once the Broadcom-Brocade sale is complete, Extreme will take control of its piece of Brocade within a few days.
"Having the extra time to the extent that it's there isn't going to hurt us," Meyercord said. "It's just going to give us more time for our operations team to prepare for the business integration."

If your company is using Avaya networking products, why has it decided to stay with, or leave, Extreme Networks?

The $5.9 billion Broadcom-Brocade acquisition has been delayed 30 days, which may turn into a 75-day delay. That’s if the deal happens at all.
SAN switching vendor Brocade Tuesday evening said the companies have re-filed for a 30-day review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Another 45-day review may follow that 30-day period. Brocade said the vendors withdrew their original notices to CFIUS under the Defense Production Act of 1950 after discussions with CFIUS.

CFIUS reviews national security implications of transactions that could hand control of a U.S. business to a foreign person. Broadcom has headquarters in Irvine, California, and Singapore.
“Brocade and Broadcom remain fully committed to the proposed acquisition and will continue to work diligently and cooperatively to close the proposed acquisition,” Brocade said in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).








The filing also states: “There can be no assurances, however, that CFIUS will ultimately agree that the parties may proceed with the proposed acquisition.”
Semiconductor conductor Broadcom agreed to buy Fibre Channel (FC) and Ethernet switching vendor Brocade in November 2016. Back then, Broadcom executives said they did not expect the deal to close before the middle of 2017. They knew they were in for a long slog to complete the international deal. And CFIUS is not the final hurdle. While the Broadcom-Brocade deal has received regulatory clearance in the U.S, European Union and Japan, the vendors still await antitrust approval in China.

Brocade and Cisco are the only FC switching vendors remaining.
Brocade said in its SEC finding Tuesday that it expects the deal to close before Oct. 28. Either side can terminate the deal if it fails to close by Nov. 1.
The Broadcom-Brocade deal directly involves other networking vendors. Because Broadcom only wants Brocade’s Fibre Channel networking products, it has sold off other pieces of Brocade’s business. Arris agreed to buy Brocade’s Ruckus Wireless and ICX Switch business for $800 million, and Extreme Networks agreed to purchase Brocade’s Ethernet switch and router business for $55 million. Those deals are contingent on the Broadcom-Brocade deal closing.

Pending Broadcom-Brocade deal hurting FC switch sales?
Brocade’s sales have taken a hit while Broadcom waits to close it out, especially on the FC end of the business. Its revenue of $581 million for the quarter that ended Jan. 28 dropped 12% year-over year, and its Fibre Channel director and switches sales declined 20%. Brocade’s $553 million in revenue for the quarter ending April 29 fell 5% year-over-year, with FC director sales down 6% and embedded switches falling 12%.
After both of the last two quarters, Brocade blamed poor SAN switching sales on “competition from alternative storage networking technologies and architectures, and customer uncertainty surrounding the pending acquisition of Brocade by Broadcom.”

        Extreme Networks Closed the Avaya Deal. Now What?
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Anders Bylund)

            Jul 21, 2017
        Updated Jul 21, 2017





























































































Networking equipment maker Extreme Networks (NASDAQ: EXTR) is almost done with its latest round of game-changing buyouts. The $100 million buyout of bankrupt rival Avaya's networking business closed on Monday.Image source: Getty Images.What's going on?
Avaya is expected to add $200 million of annual revenues to Extreme's sales, which currently stand at $559 million on a trailing-12-month basis. The deal should also add to Extreme's earnings and cash flow in its fiscal year 2018, which started three weeks ago.That leaves just one large deal in Extreme's "pending" basket. Separately, the company provided an update on the acquisition of Brocade Communication Systems' (NASDAQ: BRCD) data-center networking business. That $55 million deal is tied to a larger agreement where Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is picking up the rest of Brocade for a cool $5.9 billion, but was forced to hand off the data-center piece in order to satisfy regulatory requirements.The Broadcom/Brocade merger has been delayed by another regulatory process, but is still expected to close before the end of Brocade's fiscal year, which would be Oct. 28 this year.If the Broadcom merger falls through, that would also stop Brocade's deal with Extreme Networks. Assuming that everything works out as planned, albeit a bit later than expected, this agreement would provide another $230 million in annual sales along with positive earnings and cash flow.Image source: Getty Images.What's next?To recap, Extreme stands to add a grand total of $430 million in yearly sales by closing these acquisitions, which would be a 77% boost from the company's current revenue levels. The final revenue tally would land near $990 million.
Management calls this post-merger beast "the third largest end-to-end enterprise networking provider," behind industry titans Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). Juniper's annual sales added up to $5.1 billion over the last four quarters, and Cisco's revenues tower over the sector at $48.5 billion.So, Extreme has some catching up to do if it wants to challenge the true giants of the networking sector. But it's pretty clear that the Avaya and Brocade buys will improve Extreme's economies of scale, and bolster the company's stature at the negotiating table with prospective clients.
Closing that elusive Brocade deal could be seen as the culmination of Extreme Networks' turnaround story, turning the page to a new chapter of less desperate maneuvering. Shares have soared 158% higher in just 52 weeks, and Extreme Networks is now trading at prices not seen since the spring of 2004.10 stocks we like better than Extreme NetworksWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

History[edit]
Extreme Networks was established by co-founders Gordon Stitt, Herb Schneider and Stephen Haddock in 1996 in California, USA, with its first offices located in Cupertino, which later moved to Santa Clara, and later to San Jose.[1] Early investors included Norwest Venture Partners, AVI Capital Management, Trinity Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[4]
Gordon Stitt was a co-founder and served as chief executive officer until August 2006, when he retired and became chairman of the board of directors. In October 1996 Extreme Networks acquired Mammoth Technology. In September 1997 Extreme Networks aided in providing the first multi-vendor Gigabit Ethernet backbone at the Networld+Interop trade show. The company's first product was the Summit1 Gigabit Ethernet switch, a 6 Port Ethernet Layer 3 switching device featuring dual gigabit interface converter (GBIC) 1000BASE-SX interfaces. This product shipped in 1997 and won the "Best of Show" award at Networld+Interop. The Summit1 was also named the "Best of the Best Grand Winner" for the event. Extreme Networks won Best of Show awards at Networld+Interop five consecutive years, 1997 through 2001 with its Summit PX1 application switch, a Layer 4-7 device.
Extreme Networks introduced its first modular switching products, including the BlackDiamond 6800 and Alpine 3800 switches, in 1999. The initial public offering in April 1999, was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange as ticker "EXTR."[4] Extreme Networks acquired Optranet in February 2001 and Webstacks in March 2001. Extreme had been investors in both companies, which were purchased for about $73 million and $74 million respectively.[5] Extreme Networks announced its first 10 Gigabit Ethernet product in 2002, available with its BlackDiamond 6800 switch.
Extreme Networks' high capacity switch is the BlackDiamond X8, supporting 2.56 Terabits per line card, for data center and enterprise networks. Extreme also produces Summit and ExtremeSwitching branded switches.
In April 2013, Charles W. Berger (from ParAccel as it was acquired by Actian) replaced Oscar Rodriguez as CEO.[6] On September 12, 2013, Extreme Networks announced they would acquire Enterasys Networks for about $180 million cash.[7]
On April 19, 2015, Charles W. Berger resigned as CEO, and was replaced by Board Chairman Ed Meyercord.[8]
On May 20, 2015, Extreme Networks announced a restructuring initiative which included plans to cut approximately 285 positions (around 18% of the global workforce, inclusive of contractors.)[9]
On October 28, 2015, Extreme introduced their new "Connect Beyond the Network" tagline. They also renamed their product lines (ExtremeWireless, ExtremeSwitching, ExtremeControl, ExtremeAnalytics, ExtremeManagement, ExtremeWorks) to better reflect the company branding across the portfolio. 2016 saw Extreme enter a new market with the introduction of ExtremeCloud.
On October 31, 2016, Extreme Networks announced that it completed the acquisition of Zebra Technologies[10]' Wireless LAN business for about $55 million.
On March 7, 2017, Extreme Networks announced that it was acquiring Avaya's networking business.[11]
On March 29, 2017, Extreme Networks announced that is was acquiring Brocade's SRA (Switch Routing Analytics) business from Broadcom. [12]

History[edit]
Extreme Networks was established by co-founders Gordon Stitt, Herb Schneider and Stephen Haddock in 1996 in California, USA, with its first offices located in Cupertino, which later moved to Santa Clara, and later to San Jose.[1] Early investors included Norwest Venture Partners, AVI Capital Management, Trinity Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[4]
Gordon Stitt was a co-founder and served as chief executive officer until August 2006, when he retired and became chairman of the board of directors. In October 1996 Extreme Networks acquired Mammoth Technology. In September 1997 Extreme Networks aided in providing the first multi-vendor Gigabit Ethernet backbone at the Networld+Interop trade show. The company's first product was the Summit1 Gigabit Ethernet switch, a 6 Port Ethernet Layer 3 switching device featuring dual gigabit interface converter (GBIC) 1000BASE-SX interfaces. This product shipped in 1997 and won the "Best of Show" award at Networld+Interop. The Summit1 was also named the "Best of the Best Grand Winner" for the event. Extreme Networks won Best of Show awards at Networld+Interop five consecutive years, 1997 through 2001 with its Summit PX1 application switch, a Layer 4-7 device.
Extreme Networks introduced its first modular switching products, including the BlackDiamond 6800 and Alpine 3800 switches, in 1999. The initial public offering in April 1999, was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange as ticker "EXTR."[4] Extreme Networks acquired Optranet in February 2001 and Webstacks in March 2001. Extreme had been investors in both companies, which were purchased for about $73 million and $74 million respectively.[5] Extreme Networks announced its first 10 Gigabit Ethernet product in 2002, available with its BlackDiamond 6800 switch.
Extreme Networks' high capacity switch is the BlackDiamond X8, supporting 2.56 Terabits per line card, for data center and enterprise networks. Extreme also produces Summit and ExtremeSwitching branded switches.
In April 2013, Charles W. Berger (from ParAccel as it was acquired by Actian) replaced Oscar Rodriguez as CEO.[6] On September 12, 2013, Extreme Networks announced they would acquire Enterasys Networks for about $180 million cash.[7]
On April 19, 2015, Charles W. Berger resigned as CEO, and was replaced by Board Chairman Ed Meyercord.[8]
On May 20, 2015, Extreme Networks announced a restructuring initiative which included plans to cut approximately 285 positions (around 18% of the global workforce, inclusive of contractors.)[9]
On October 28, 2015, Extreme introduced their new "Connect Beyond the Network" tagline. They also renamed their product lines (ExtremeWireless, ExtremeSwitching, ExtremeControl, ExtremeAnalytics, ExtremeManagement, ExtremeWorks) to better reflect the company branding across the portfolio. 2016 saw Extreme enter a new market with the introduction of ExtremeCloud.
On October 31, 2016, Extreme Networks announced that it completed the acquisition of Zebra Technologies[10]' Wireless LAN business for about $55 million.
On March 7, 2017, Extreme Networks announced that it was acquiring Avaya's networking business.[11]
On March 29, 2017, Extreme Networks announced that is was acquiring Brocade's SRA (Switch Routing Analytics) business from Broadcom. [12]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
