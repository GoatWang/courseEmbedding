A Real Gone Music/The Second Disc Release 


In a Grammy, Oscar and Golden Globe-winning career that’s taken him from Tiny Tim to Daft Punk, Paul Williams has seen his songs recorded by Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Elvis Presley, David Bowie, The Carpenters, and of course, Kermit the Frog. During his reign as perhaps the Seventies’ most in-demand songwriter, Williams also kept busy as an actor, television personality and recording artist. He came into his own as a vocalist at Reprise and A&M Records on albums such as Someday Man and Just an Old-Fashioned Love Song before moving to Epic Records’ sister label, Portrait. At Portrait – also the home of Heart and, briefly, Ringo Starr – Williams recorded what he later described as “one of the most listenable and good-feeling records I’ve ever been associated with.”  That record was A Little on the Windy Side. The album was recorded in Nashville with Paul’s brother Mentor Williams—the songwriter of Dobie Gray’s Top 5 hit “Drift Away” and Paul’s onetime bandmate in The Holy Mackerel—and featured Music City’s top session cats including David Briggs, Reggie Young and Troy Seals (a talented songwriter in his own right.)  Despite a wealth of strong material including movie tunes “Here’s Another Fine Mess” and “My Fair Share,” fan favorite “For Goodness Sake,” and a collaboration with Brill Building legend Jeff Barry, A Little on the Windy Side all but disappeared when the Portrait label was briefly shuttered.  Years later, a limited edition Japanese CD release came and went, too.  Real Gone Music and Second Disc Records have come to the rescue with this freshly-remastered first-ever American reissue.  Even better, four bonus tracks have been added to this Expanded Edition!  Three never-before-heard outtakes (including Paul’s own rendition of “When the River Meets the Sea” from the beloved holiday special Emmet Otter’s Jug-Band Christmasand “Love Conquers All,” originally performed by Seals & Crofts) and a rare mono single round out this package, which features new liner notes from The Second Disc’s Joe Marchese and remastering by Sean Brennan at Battery Studios in New York.

					    Director Stephen Kessler sets out to profile the prolific singer/songwriter/actor who seemed ubiquitous in the 1970s and '80s, only to disappear from the spotlight following a protracted battle with drugs and alcohol. Convinced that the once-prolific Paul Williams has passed away as he scours the Internet to purchase one of his albums, Kessler discovers to his surprise that not only is Williams alive and well, but he's also still performing regularly to adoring fans around the world. Like many teens of the 1970s and '80s, Kessler connected with Williams' pensive, poetic songs about love and loneliness, and upon learning that he would be performing at a Winnipeg screening of Phantom of the Paradise (panned by critics, the notorious Brian De Palma bomb was a massive hit in just two cities: Winnipeg and Paris), the filmmaker convinces Williams to be profiled in a documentary. At first Williams is somewhat aloof, yet Kessler persists and, in time, makes a breakthrough by bonding with the performer over his favorite seafood. Meanwhile, as Kessler begins exploring the highs and lows of Williams' career, the subject pulls the storyteller into the film, and a close friendship begins to develop. Later, Kessler tags along with Williams for a concert in the Philippines, where their bond is cemented during a tense bus ride through the Mindanao jungle. As a result, the filmmaker gets the one thing he's craved since one of his earliest meetings with Williams, though when it seems to go awry he fears that he may have betrayed his new friend's trust.

Career[edit]
Williams created the first national US magazine of rock music criticism Crawdaddy![1] in January 1966[2] on the campus of Swarthmore College with the help of some of his fellow science fiction fans (he had previously put out some science fiction fanzines).[3] The first issue was ten mimeographed pages written entirely by Williams.[4][5] He left the magazine in 1968 and reclaimed the title in 1993, but had to end it in 2003 due to financial difficulties.
He was also the author of more than 25 books, of which the best-known are Outlaw Blues, Das Energi, and Bob Dylan: Performing Artist, the acclaimed three-part series. Williams was a leading authority on the works of musicians Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Neil Young, and science fiction writers Philip K. Dick (serving as the executor of his literary estate)[6] and Theodore Sturgeon. His final published books were The 20th Century's Greatest Hits (a "Top 40" list that includes movies, books & other documents)(2000)[7] and the last volume of his critical look at the music of Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan: Mind Out of Time (Performing Artist Vol. 3, 1987-2000) (2004).
In 1981 he edited and published, with David G. Hartwell, the first book edition of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a foreword by Jimmy Carter.
Association with Philip K. Dick[edit]
In the spring of 1967 Williams was introduced to the fiction of Philip K. Dick by Trina Robbins, Bhob Stewart and Art Spiegelman.[8] In August 1968 at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention he introduced himself to Dick, beginning a friendship that lasted through the rest of Dick's life.[9]
In 1974 Williams interviewed Dick for Rolling Stone magazine. The resulting article, "The True Stories of Philip K. Dick" which appeared in the November 6, 1975 issue of Rolling Stone magazine covered many theories of the 1971 break-in of Dick's San Rafael home in Northern California, a 1972 suicide attempt in British Columbia, his subsequent move to Orange County, California, politics, the relationship of Dick's lengthy amphetamine use and slight LSD use to his writing career and many other subjects in addition to Dick's fiction and writing career.[10]
Williams was Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and used that position to get several of the author's previously unpublished neorealist novels into print.
From 1983 to 1992 Williams ran the Philip K. Dick Society along with Andy Watson and Keith Bowden in the UK. PKDS had some thousands of members internationally and was a significant influence in publicising Dick's work internationally. It published 30 quarterly Newsletters including some previously unpublished Dick material.
In 1986, Williams published one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick.
Williams is a featured interviewee in three documentaries about Dick: a biographical documentary BBC2 released in 1994 as part of its Arena arts series called Arena - Philip K Dick: A Day in the Afterlife,[11] The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick, which was produced in 2001, and The Penultimate Truth About Philip K. Dick, another biographical documentary film produced in 2007.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Williams was a long time friend and associate of Mel Lyman, and lived and worked at Lyman's intentional community at Fort Hill, Boston for a few months in 1971. According to Rolling Stone's David Felton, Williams told him he had actually had to escape under cover of darkness, as he had been told he was being watched and would not be allowed to leave.[13] According to his official website, he also lived in a wilderness commune at Galley Bay in British Columbia.
In 1972, Williams married Sachiko Kanenobu, Japanese female singer-songwriter; they raised two children.[14]
In the 1980s, he was married to Donna Nassar[15] who provided many illustrations for Crawdaddy!'s second incarnation.
In 1992 Williams began a relationship with anti-folk co-founder and singer Cindy Lee Berryhill[2], who became his wife.
In 2009, Williams lived in Encinitas, California with Berryhill and their son, Alexander, part of the year but eventually had to enter a nursing home due to dementia.[16] He was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the early onset of which was attributed to a brain injury Williams sustained in a 1995 bicycle accident.[17][18] The medical bills were enormous, and the family asked for donations toward his continued medical care.[19] On December 14, 2009 Paul Williams was accepted for Medi-Cal (Medicaid) coverage.[20]
Death[edit]
Williams died on March 27, 2013, at his home in California at age 64 from complications related to a 1995 bicycle accident.[21] Williams, according to a note on his official website, "suffered a traumatic brain injury in a bicycle accident, leading to early onset of dementia, and a steady decline to the point where he now requires full-time care. The burden on his immediate family has been immense."[22]

Career[edit]
Williams created the first national US magazine of rock music criticism Crawdaddy![1] in January 1966[2] on the campus of Swarthmore College with the help of some of his fellow science fiction fans (he had previously put out some science fiction fanzines).[3] The first issue was ten mimeographed pages written entirely by Williams.[4][5] He left the magazine in 1968 and reclaimed the title in 1993, but had to end it in 2003 due to financial difficulties.
He was also the author of more than 25 books, of which the best-known are Outlaw Blues, Das Energi, and Bob Dylan: Performing Artist, the acclaimed three-part series. Williams was a leading authority on the works of musicians Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Neil Young, and science fiction writers Philip K. Dick (serving as the executor of his literary estate)[6] and Theodore Sturgeon. His final published books were The 20th Century's Greatest Hits (a "Top 40" list that includes movies, books & other documents)(2000)[7] and the last volume of his critical look at the music of Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan: Mind Out of Time (Performing Artist Vol. 3, 1987-2000) (2004).
In 1981 he edited and published, with David G. Hartwell, the first book edition of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a foreword by Jimmy Carter.
Association with Philip K. Dick[edit]
In the spring of 1967 Williams was introduced to the fiction of Philip K. Dick by Trina Robbins, Bhob Stewart and Art Spiegelman.[8] In August 1968 at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention he introduced himself to Dick, beginning a friendship that lasted through the rest of Dick's life.[9]
In 1974 Williams interviewed Dick for Rolling Stone magazine. The resulting article, "The True Stories of Philip K. Dick" which appeared in the November 6, 1975 issue of Rolling Stone magazine covered many theories of the 1971 break-in of Dick's San Rafael home in Northern California, a 1972 suicide attempt in British Columbia, his subsequent move to Orange County, California, politics, the relationship of Dick's lengthy amphetamine use and slight LSD use to his writing career and many other subjects in addition to Dick's fiction and writing career.[10]
Williams was Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and used that position to get several of the author's previously unpublished neorealist novels into print.
From 1983 to 1992 Williams ran the Philip K. Dick Society along with Andy Watson and Keith Bowden in the UK. PKDS had some thousands of members internationally and was a significant influence in publicising Dick's work internationally. It published 30 quarterly Newsletters including some previously unpublished Dick material.
In 1986, Williams published one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick.
Williams is a featured interviewee in three documentaries about Dick: a biographical documentary BBC2 released in 1994 as part of its Arena arts series called Arena - Philip K Dick: A Day in the Afterlife,[11] The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick, which was produced in 2001, and The Penultimate Truth About Philip K. Dick, another biographical documentary film produced in 2007.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Williams was a long time friend and associate of Mel Lyman, and lived and worked at Lyman's intentional community at Fort Hill, Boston for a few months in 1971. According to Rolling Stone's David Felton, Williams told him he had actually had to escape under cover of darkness, as he had been told he was being watched and would not be allowed to leave.[13] According to his official website, he also lived in a wilderness commune at Galley Bay in British Columbia.
In 1972, Williams married Sachiko Kanenobu, Japanese female singer-songwriter; they raised two children.[14]
In the 1980s, he was married to Donna Nassar[15] who provided many illustrations for Crawdaddy!'s second incarnation.
In 1992 Williams began a relationship with anti-folk co-founder and singer Cindy Lee Berryhill[2], who became his wife.
In 2009, Williams lived in Encinitas, California with Berryhill and their son, Alexander, part of the year but eventually had to enter a nursing home due to dementia.[16] He was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the early onset of which was attributed to a brain injury Williams sustained in a 1995 bicycle accident.[17][18] The medical bills were enormous, and the family asked for donations toward his continued medical care.[19] On December 14, 2009 Paul Williams was accepted for Medi-Cal (Medicaid) coverage.[20]
Death[edit]
Williams died on March 27, 2013, at his home in California at age 64 from complications related to a 1995 bicycle accident.[21] Williams, according to a note on his official website, "suffered a traumatic brain injury in a bicycle accident, leading to early onset of dementia, and a steady decline to the point where he now requires full-time care. The burden on his immediate family has been immense."[22]

Career[edit]
Williams created the first national US magazine of rock music criticism Crawdaddy![1] in January 1966[2] on the campus of Swarthmore College with the help of some of his fellow science fiction fans (he had previously put out some science fiction fanzines).[3] The first issue was ten mimeographed pages written entirely by Williams.[4][5] He left the magazine in 1968 and reclaimed the title in 1993, but had to end it in 2003 due to financial difficulties.
He was also the author of more than 25 books, of which the best-known are Outlaw Blues, Das Energi, and Bob Dylan: Performing Artist, the acclaimed three-part series. Williams was a leading authority on the works of musicians Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Neil Young, and science fiction writers Philip K. Dick (serving as the executor of his literary estate)[6] and Theodore Sturgeon. His final published books were The 20th Century's Greatest Hits (a "Top 40" list that includes movies, books & other documents)(2000)[7] and the last volume of his critical look at the music of Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan: Mind Out of Time (Performing Artist Vol. 3, 1987-2000) (2004).
In 1981 he edited and published, with David G. Hartwell, the first book edition of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a foreword by Jimmy Carter.
Association with Philip K. Dick[edit]
In the spring of 1967 Williams was introduced to the fiction of Philip K. Dick by Trina Robbins, Bhob Stewart and Art Spiegelman.[8] In August 1968 at the 26th World Science Fiction Convention he introduced himself to Dick, beginning a friendship that lasted through the rest of Dick's life.[9]
In 1974 Williams interviewed Dick for Rolling Stone magazine. The resulting article, "The True Stories of Philip K. Dick" which appeared in the November 6, 1975 issue of Rolling Stone magazine covered many theories of the 1971 break-in of Dick's San Rafael home in Northern California, a 1972 suicide attempt in British Columbia, his subsequent move to Orange County, California, politics, the relationship of Dick's lengthy amphetamine use and slight LSD use to his writing career and many other subjects in addition to Dick's fiction and writing career.[10]
Williams was Dick's literary executor for several years after Dick's death and used that position to get several of the author's previously unpublished neorealist novels into print.
From 1983 to 1992 Williams ran the Philip K. Dick Society along with Andy Watson and Keith Bowden in the UK. PKDS had some thousands of members internationally and was a significant influence in publicising Dick's work internationally. It published 30 quarterly Newsletters including some previously unpublished Dick material.
In 1986, Williams published one of the first biographies of Dick, entitled Only Apparently Real: The World of Philip K. Dick.
Williams is a featured interviewee in three documentaries about Dick: a biographical documentary BBC2 released in 1994 as part of its Arena arts series called Arena - Philip K Dick: A Day in the Afterlife,[11] The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick, which was produced in 2001, and The Penultimate Truth About Philip K. Dick, another biographical documentary film produced in 2007.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Williams was a long time friend and associate of Mel Lyman, and lived and worked at Lyman's intentional community at Fort Hill, Boston for a few months in 1971. According to Rolling Stone's David Felton, Williams told him he had actually had to escape under cover of darkness, as he had been told he was being watched and would not be allowed to leave.[13] According to his official website, he also lived in a wilderness commune at Galley Bay in British Columbia.
In 1972, Williams married Sachiko Kanenobu, Japanese female singer-songwriter; they raised two children.[14]
In the 1980s, he was married to Donna Nassar[15] who provided many illustrations for Crawdaddy!'s second incarnation.
In 1992 Williams began a relationship with anti-folk co-founder and singer Cindy Lee Berryhill[2], who became his wife.
In 2009, Williams lived in Encinitas, California with Berryhill and their son, Alexander, part of the year but eventually had to enter a nursing home due to dementia.[16] He was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the early onset of which was attributed to a brain injury Williams sustained in a 1995 bicycle accident.[17][18] The medical bills were enormous, and the family asked for donations toward his continued medical care.[19] On December 14, 2009 Paul Williams was accepted for Medi-Cal (Medicaid) coverage.[20]
Death[edit]
Williams died on March 27, 2013, at his home in California at age 64 from complications related to a 1995 bicycle accident.[21] Williams, according to a note on his official website, "suffered a traumatic brain injury in a bicycle accident, leading to early onset of dementia, and a steady decline to the point where he now requires full-time care. The burden on his immediate family has been immense."[22]
