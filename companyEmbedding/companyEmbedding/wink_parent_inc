Nathan Smith knew that Wink would have to go. It was early in 2015, and the smart home company he'd started less than a year earlier was being held back by the very thing that brought it into existence: Quirky. "We knew that Wink needed a parent other than Quirky to achieve its full potential," Smith tells The Verge. In under a year, Smith had gone from founding Wink inside of Quirky to looking for a way to escape it.


 
"Quirky was very much a launchpad for us."
The reasons were obvious. Quirky, the ambitious tech incubator, was a wildly mismanaged sinking ship. It was going broke, and little of its business seemed sustainable outside of Wink. So months before Quirky declared bankruptcy, Wink started searching for a suitor. "We were out looking at either raising some money to spin Wink out as a separate company or a potential acquisition for Wink," Smith says.
In November of 2015, Wink sold to the component manufacturer Flex (formerly known as Flextronics), for $15 million, an unglamorous transition that struck many as a last-ditch bid for survival. Flex had been manufacturing Wink’s smart home hubs, so the pairing wasn’t entirely out of nowhere. But to Wink customers, it seemed like their smart home service might just disappear amid the chaos.
Now Smith contends that, free from Quirky's baggage, Wink is better-positioned than ever  to take on the smart home market. "We've always thought that Wink was best suited to use the resources and scale of a good parent company," says Smith, who is today Wink's chief technical officer. "Quirky was very much a launchpad for us."

Wink, which launched in 2014 with a smart home hub tying together several competing standards, now has 1.3 million devices on its network, with another 20,000 coming online every week (Wink declined to say across how many homes). Smith says growth hasn't slowed down, continuing throughout Wink's ejection from a failing parent. "We never lost a step as far as user and device growth," he says.
Flex can seem like a strange bedfellow for continuing that journey. But the truth is Wink didn’t have much choice. As Smith notes, Quirky’s financial situation "encumbered Wink to a certain extent." Though it had been looking for a buyer for months — and though Quirky technically put it up for auction — Wink largely ended up in Flex’s lap because Quirky owed Flex a ton of money; nearly $18.7 million, according to its bankruptcy filing, making it Quirky’s single largest creditor. By handing over Wink for $15 million, Quirky was able to write off a big portion of its debt, and Flex ensured it didn’t walk away empty handed.
Unlike Quirky, Flex doesn't focus on consumers
 
Wink's new parent company focuses on making electronics for other businesses, not on selling electronics and services to consumers like Wink does. That means Wink doesn't inherit powerful retail relationships like it did under Quirky. One of those partnerships, with Home Depot, plays a big role in Wink's existing and continued success; it’s maintained that relationship even after the separation.
Flex does have its advantages. It's profitable, for one, so Wink doesn't have to worry about disappearing next year (so long as Flex stays interested in the smart home market). And Smith says that Flex can direct companies with smart home aspirations toward Wink, allowing Flex to build their products and integrate them with Wink's system. Wink remains independent inside of Flex, but Smith implies that the two will work together closely when the right products come along; it has nothing to announce along those lines just yet, however.

In the future, Smith suggests that the Wink hub could go away, eventually being integrated with any number of hardware devices. (When the hub first launched, in 2014, a Wink VP commented to The New York Times that "We'd love not to be in the hub business.") That makes Flex's acquisition feel a bit more logical, opening up opportunities for Wink to embeds the hub inside more practical smart home products, though Smith still sees this as a few years down the line.
Smith says Wink's immediate goal isn't to ramp up user growth or available products — it's to make using smart home products on its network easier for homeowners. That's an increasingly important battle, as the smart home landscape has become far more competitive over the past two years, attracting entrenched tech giants. Apple is now in the market ("I try to think on my good days that we're not in competition with Apple," Smith says. "I certainly don't like betting against them."); and Samsung bought a company called SmartThings that offers a product that's almost identical to Wink. That's why Smith views building a smoother smart home experience as the key to Wink's continued expansion. "If you look at SmartThings on the App Store, and you look at us on the App Store, you'll see [the difference] right away," Smith says. "It's a 1.5 star app. I think people will gravitate toward experiences that make things simple for them."
Wink's competition is getting stronger, but it now has time to compete
Wink's plan to get there involves, essentially, making its users forget it even exists. "We're gonna be rolling out features that sort of allow you to use Wink more but use the app less," Smith says. The hope is that Wink can make the smart home legitimately smart, letting products automate themselves, rather than requiring homeowners to program in everything they want to happen. Imagine if your lights just knew your schedule, and turned on and off automatically. "We've been working on this for two years internally," Smith says. "These features are actually going to live up to the promises the smart home has been making for years."
Of course, there are good reasons no one has gotten there yet. The smart home landscape is still a mess, and Wink's solution for it — tie together multiple standards — is functional but inelegant; not to mention something that can be reproduced by competitors. But going into 2016, Wink very much seems to be in a better place. It's growing. It's planning new features. And it doesn’t have Quirky’s black cloud hanging over its head. Wink isn't a profitable company yet (it's working out a timeline with Flex for when that might happen), but it now has a stretch of road to get there. The smart home landscape is far from settled, and it seems like Wink is still in the fight over what it'll look like.

Quirky is on a mission to bring the smart home to everyone through it’s own platform Wink. Thanks to partnerships with the Home Depot and General Electric, Quirky says it’s got 100,000 people using the Wink app alongside compatible products. It’s been a rapid ascent for the small startup and Quirky wants to keep it going. The company announced seven new products on Tuesday at an event held in its headquarters in Manhattan, New York.
Quirky aims to help average, every day people build their own personal smart home, one connected device at a time. Every device is relatively cheap, especially in comparison with big-name products like Nest and others. Of course, many of the more expensive products, including Nest, are compatible with the Wink app. Quirky introduced the Wink Hub a few months ago, which aims to connect all the different smart devices in your home, regardless of the frequency they’re on, be it Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, or what have you.






With the help of GE, Quirky is continuing in the same vein. Its seven new products range from the fully customizable Spotter Uniq, to the basic Tapt light switch and Outlink outlet. You can pre-order all of the following products on Wink’s website, but here’s a description of each one:


Quirky+GE Tripper window/door sensor ($40)

Tripper is an incredibly tiny sensor that you can attach to any door or window. It detects when a door or window has been opened, closed, or otherwise tampered with, and can alert you of the disturbance. The battery should last for two years before you need to replace it. Quirky says it’ll cost $40 for two and they’ll ship in December.


Quirky+GE Overflow water sensor ($35)

Overflow is a water sensor that detects moisture levels in your home and warns you if you have a serious leak. It costs $35.


Quirky+GE Outlink wall outlet and energy monitor ($50)

Outlink is a smart outlet that not only helps you keep track of the amount of electricity you’re using, but also turns any appliance into a smart appliance. All you have to do is plug a device into the outlet and you can turn it on or off remotely. Outlink will cost $50 and is available now.


Quirky+GE Tapt light switch ($60)

Tapt is a light switch that can connect any button-powered device on with the tap of a button. It costs $60 and is available now.


Quirky+GE Ascend garage door controller ($100)

Ascend is essentially a sensor that you place on your garage door, which allows you to open and close it. It also sends you alerts if it’s been disturbed or you accidentally left the garage door open. You can also set it up for guest use, removing the need to give your house-sitter keys. Quirky says 71 percent of people enter homes through the garage door, and at $90, it’s a bargain. You’ll have to wait until next year to get one, but you can pre-order it now.


Quirky+GE Spotter multipurpose sensor ($60)

Spotter Uniq is perhaps the most interesting device Quirky unveiled today. The inventor, Denny Fong, previously made the original Spotter for Quirky, but wanted to make one that was more customizable. The Spotter Uniq is fully customizable from the ground up. You can choose any of four different sensors, including options like barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, motion, carbon monoxide, and many more. You can also choose what color you want it to come in, so that it matches your wallpaper. Depending on which sensors you choose, it’ll cost between $30 and $120. The Spotter Uniq ships in December.


Quirky+GE Norm thermostat ($80)

Norm is “the death of the thermostat,” according to Quirky. It’s just a small, white box that you tack on your wall, but it communicates with all the other devices in the house to access information from the sensors. The sensors then help Norm determine the best way to control the climate of your entire house. The anti-thermostat will cost you just $80, but it works best if you have multiple Wink products, of course. It’ll ship in a few weeks.




The Wink app (free and available for iOS and Android)
The Wink app also got a few big updates, so users can now access a few more features, including Activity, Shortcuts, and Robots. Under the Activity section, you’ll see every action you told a connected device to do on that day. The Shortcuts section lets you program settings for multiple devices at the same time. That way, if you’re having a movie night, Wink will automatically dim or turn off the lights, close the shades, turn on your TV, and so on. The Robots section is really the part of the app where you can set up home automation. In that part of the app, you can tell the lights to come on at a certain hour, cue the doors to lock at 10 p.m. before you go to bed, and so on. Apparently, automation is actually pretty popular with Wink users, as 28 percent of them are already using the feature.











Wink now has its own website, where all the compatible products are listed, videos of the products in action are posted, and the company gives advice to would-be smart home builders. It’s all part of its hope to build awareness and convince Americans that the smart home can be affordable and accessible to all. Quirky jokes that “the light bulb is the gateway drug to the connected home,” because 40 percent of devices on the Wink platform are light bulbs. However, Quirky believes that once you see how easy and effortless it is to control your lights with the Wink app, you’ll be inspired to try smart outlets like Outlink, sensors like Spotter, and switches like Tapt. The approach seems to be working, too; about 50 percent of Wink users own three or more devices.
Quirky, Wink, and GE are really just getting started in the space, but it’s clear that they mean business.

Wink began in 2004 as a social search engine to use input from other people to influence the relevance of Web pages. But in 2006 Wink changed directions to become a people search engine.  At the time there were numerous growing social networks and other places online with limited ability to search. Serving those looking to find old friends or anyone with an active online life, Wink searches about one billion profiles across popular social networks and other destinations.
Wink merged with Reunion.com in November, 2008.
