Services
Tax Controversies
Allen and his team have extensive experience in many aspects of tax controversies. Recent assignments included numerous representations of individuals and companies in the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program and Initiative. These complex cases required attention to many years of financial transactions to assess and accurately report them to the IRS and many States. 

In addition, representations include appeals of IRS Audit findings, negotiations of Offers In Compromise, assistance in IRS audits and assisting Counsel in criminal tax investigations as a Kovel retained CPA.

Often, the criminal matters result in conferences with Assistant U.S. Attorneys in conjunction with counsel to address tax aspects of cases.

We prepare delinquent returns, amended returns and consult on appropriate tax positions on transactions. 

The range of work entails Income Tax, Estate Tax, Corporate Tax, International Tax Issues and compliance with U.S. Treasury FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reporting).

Civil Audit Representation
Collection Matters
Delinquent Return Preparation

Whether in the trenches of a courtroom or a firm's war room, our presentation is credible and clear, helping us achieve the best outcome for our clients.



Services
Kovel Assignments
A core competency of our practice is serving as a Kovel accountant in both civil and criminal matters, assisting lawyers in developing a case and evaluating 
      potential defenses. Our team has substantial experience partnering with some of the nation's premiere white collar defense teams in criminal tax cases and investigations. 
      We are actively involved at every stage of the litigation or investigation process, from examining and developing a defense against the Governmen's case, to delivering expert testimony. 
      In civil matters, we handle situations involving tax and financial issues and are similarly experienced at offering expert testimony at depositions and trial. 

      From a bet-the-company dispute involving Fortune 100 organizations to a dispute over the dissolution of a family business, an expert witness can have a profound influence 
      on the outcome of a case. Identifying the right expert, however, is often a complicated matter. Serving as an expert witness requires not only a complete grasp of multi-faceted, 
      complex issues, but also requires the ability to distill, clarify and communicate complicated matters in simple, accessible and concise language. Our understanding of 
      courtroom procedure and the role of expert witnesses is the result of our involvement in dozens of cases in state and federal courts and other tribunals. 



Areas of expertise include:

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Banking & Financial Services Claims
Bankruptcy Investigations
Claims Evaluation and Defense
Cross Examination & Deposition Preparation 
Damages Calculations, Discovery and Reports
Matrimonial Matters
Probate Matters
Settlement Negotiation
