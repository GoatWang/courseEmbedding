We are a locally owned company who is excited to offer a unique vacation experience in Whitehall, Michigan. We have spent four years remodeling our vessel to offer our guests a comfortable and relaxing experience while staying on the water!
Our 33 foot houseboat has accommodations for 8, with a functional kitchen, bathroom, TV with DVD player, complete with a sundeck and slip. Our mission is to offer families, couples and small groups a vacation that will provide a relaxing atmosphere mixed with adventure and creating lifelong memories. Stay-A-Float houseboat rental is located on almost 2600 acres of beautiful White Lake in Whitehall Michigan, within walking distance to optional activities in the down town area.
With pricing comparable to renting a cottage and a boat separately, we can provide a vacation that offers both for one price that the whole family will enjoy! Prices reflect staying aboard with operation of the boat, but you may also stay dockside for a discounted rate!
What we offer:

Rent the company’s 33 foot houseboat by the night, weekend, or week.
Accommodations for eight: Two tables that fold down into beds, a jack knife bed, cuddy cabin
Kitchen- mini-fridge, sink, faucet, cupboards, counter top, microwave, coffee pot, cutting board
