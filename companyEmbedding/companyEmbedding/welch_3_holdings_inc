Inspiration
When William Noah Allyn and Dr. Francis Welch invented the world’s first hand-held illuminating ophthalmoscope in 1915, they were looking not only into patient’s eyes, but into the future. Dr. Welch knew that a patient’s eye provided a unique look into their general state of health and, with Allyn, they firmly believed every physician should have the tools needed to make a proper assessment. Today, Welch Allyn holds firmly to that promise, especially as medical products become more complex. Our pride and inspiration stems from knowing that the Welch Allyn brand can be found in almost any healthcare setting and that almost every patient-doctor encounter starts with one of our many medical diagnostic devices.
