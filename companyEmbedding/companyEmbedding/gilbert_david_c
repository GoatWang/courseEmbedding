  Interval Leisure Group (ILG) (NASDAQ: IILG), a leading global provider of membership and leisure services to the vacation industry, today announced the appointment of David C. Gilbert as president of Interval International, effective September 1. He will report to Craig M. Nash, ILG’s chairman, president, and CEO.   David C. Gilbert, President of Interval International (Photo: Business Wire)   Gilbert previously served as Interval International’s executive vice president of resort sales and marketing and has been instrumental in the growth of the Interval resort network and in the development and marketing of major products and programs. He was a trustee of the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), the ARDA International Foundation, and the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association Education Foundation. With the goal of attracting new entrants to the industry, Gilbert also spearheaded the establishment of the prestigious Shared Ownership Investment Conferences now hosted around the world.  “Over his 25-year career, David has played a pivotal role in Interval’s sales and marketing success, as well as in creating new business opportunities,” said Nash. “His proven track record and leadership skills will be invaluable in overseeing this business unit, while I continue to concentrate on broadening ILG’s footprint and driving shareholder value.”  Jeanette Marbert, ILG’s chief operating officer, added, “As I expand my focus on helping to execute ILG’s strategic plan and optimize cross-functional efficiencies, I am confident that David’s knowledge of the company and the industry will serve him well as he takes on the day-to-day responsibilities at Interval.”  In his new position, Gilbert will direct the implementation of Interval’s global strategy, which includes enhancing the overall value proposition, member engagement, and client relationships.  “I am very excited to head such a talented and dedicated group. I look forward to working with everyone on the team, to take Interval International into the future,” Gilbert said.

            The David C. Cook Journey through the Bible is a unique resource that approaches the Bible story by story. In these pages you will discover around 250 of your favorite Bible stories presented with background information in word and picture.


This book is excellent. It was written well and covered a lot of ground with interesting insights and comments. I recommend it to all who have an interest in the Bible. For those of you who have little interest, read it and you will learn and find interesting things you never dreamed of.


Excellent, comprehensive, and very readable walk through the Bible. Anyone interested in understanding the story within the Bible will find this book a fascinating read. It was so informative, and inspirational.


Wish I could give it more stars...great insights and very interesting! Truly fascinating, very good reading, and makes me love to read the Bible.

            Wow! I love this book! I like to buy it for friends as gifts, especially for those who are taking their child's spiritual education seriously!! It helps put familiar Bible texts and stories into historically accurate perspective. It also is a HUGE help in understanding the culture of the times. The info is arranged in small bites and could be used daily. If I was rich I would buy this for all my friends for Christmas!

            This book is used as a resource with Veritas Press Bible cards.  The VP cards correlate very nicely with the book.  The book has wonderful colorful pages to keep my son's attention while I'm reading.
