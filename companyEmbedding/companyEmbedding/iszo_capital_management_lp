NEW YORK, Aug. 31, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- IsZo Capital Management LP and Black Horse Capital Advisors LLC, two of the largest minority shareholders of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:   TARO), announced today that they delivered the following letter to Taro exercising their respective legal rights under Israeli law to demand certain information relating to the approval by Taro's Board of Directors, Special Committee and Audit Committee of the Agreement of Merger, dated as of August 12, 2012, by which Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (BSE: SUNPHARMA), Taro's controlling shareholder, proposes to take Taro private and squeeze out Taro's minority shareholders.

Re: Pending Sun/Taro Going Private, Squeeze-Out Merger 
       IsZo Capital Letters dated November 29, 2011, December 13, 2011, 
       December 23, 2011, February 15, 2012 and May 10, 2012
Ladies and Gentlemen:                                                           
IsZo Capital Management LP ("IsZo") and Black Horse Capital Advisors LLC ("Black Horse"), two of Taro's largest minority shareholders, write to you as follows: 
1.  On August 13, 2012, Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ("Taro" or the "Company") announced that it had entered into an Agreement of Merger, dated as of August 12, 2012 (the "Merger Agreement"), with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and certain of its affiliates ("Sun"), pursuant to which it is intended that a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun merge with and into Taro (the "Merger"), whereupon Taro will become a private company, wholly owned by Sun, and its shares will cease to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). The purpose of the Merger is for Sun, Taro's controlling shareholder, to squeeze out Taro's minority shareholders and acquire Taro's remaining share capital not already owned by Sun at the bargain price of $39.5 per share.
2.  We would like to remind Taro that Sun's previous inadequate and opportunistic offer to purchase the minority shares of Taro for $24.5 per share (the "Previous Offer") was rejected by Taro's Special Committee, which was formed to evaluate the Previous Offer, ten months after the date on which the Previous Offer was first disclosed publicly.
Remarkably, in contrast to the protracted delay by Taro's Special Committee in determining that the Previous Offer was grossly inadequate, substantially undervalued Taro and was clearly deserving of rejection, Taro's Special Committee, Audit Committee and Board of Directors moved quickly to approve the Merger Agreement, under which it is proposed that Taro be taken private by its controlling shareholder and its minority shareholders be squeezed out at what appears to be an egregiously inadequate price, only three weeks after the Previous Offer was rejected by the Special Committee.  
These actions raise serious concerns about the process conducted by Taro's Special Committee, Audit Committee and Board of Directors in connection with the Merger, including questions relating to the (a) information examined and discussions held by Taro's Special Committee, Audit Committee and Board of Directors prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement, (b) compliance by Taro with the U.S. disclosure requirements that apply to it as a public company with shares traded on the NYSE and (c) exercise of fiduciary duties by Taro's directors for the benefit of Taro's minority shareholders, as required by law.
3.  In accordance with Sections 184(3) and 185(a)(1) of the Companies Law, 1999 (the "Companies Law"), as shareholders of the Company, IsZo and Black Horse have the right to review each document relating to acts or transactions that are required to be approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 275 of the Companies Law.
Accordingly, as the consummation of the Merger requires the approval of Taro's shareholders pursuant to the provisions of Section 275 of the Companies Law, as Taro shareholders we have the right to review each document relating to the Merger.  This includes, for the avoidance of doubt, any document relating to the Previous Offer, as the Previous Offer set the stage for the discussions conducted between Sun and Taro with respect to the Merger, as well as any document (including proxies, powers of attorney and voting cards, in each case, whether submitted electronically or in physical form, as well as copies of the Related Documentation (as such term is defined in the letters, dated February 12, 2012 and April 3, 2012, sent by our counsel on our behalf to Taro's counsel)) relating to voting at the Company's 2011 General Meeting (the "2011 General Meeting"), at which Taro's shareholders allegedly approved the grant of indemnification, insurance and exculpation protections to Taro's directors and officers, including for violations in connection with a merger or other going private transaction.   
4.0  In light of the foregoing, pursuant to Sections 184(3) and 185(a)(1) of the Companies Law, we demand that Taro provide us, within seven days from the date of this letter, copies of each document relating to the Merger, the Previous Offer and the 2011 General Meeting, including and without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, the following documents and information (the "Related Documents"):
4.1.  The minutes of all meetings of Taro's Board of Directors, Audit Committee and/or Special Committee, in which the agenda included the discussion and/or approval of the Merger and/or the Previous Offer.
4.2.  All schedules (including disclosure schedules) and exhibits to the Merger Agreement and any confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, voting agreements, side letters and any other ancillary agreements relating to the Merger Agreement.
4.3.  All materials (including background materials) prepared, presented or conveyed in any manner to Taro's Board of Directors, Audit Committee and/or Special Committee with respect to the Merger and/or the Previous Offer, including financial valuations, fairness opinions, financial projections (including pro forma reports), legal opinions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any legal opinion relating to the obligation of Taro to file publicly any reports with respect to the Merger and the Previous Offer), any information upon which Taro's management has based its repeated assertions that Taro's financial performance is not or is not likely to be sustainable and any other information relevant to the decision of Taro's Board of Directors, Audit Committee and Special Committee to recommend the Merger to Taro's minority shareholders, including any information and documents prepared or furnished by the advisors and legal counsel to the Special Committee, including Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldfarb Seligman & Co and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.  
4.4.  Taro's current registry of shareholders and the most up to date list of Taro's shareholders in its possession.
4.5.  A list of shareholders of Taro with respect to which Taro and/or any of its directors and/or officers is aware of any "personal interest" (as defined in the Companies Law) that any such shareholders may have in the proposed Merger.
4.6.  All benefit plans, option agreements, warrants and any other compensation agreements, arrangements or understandings between Taro and its directors and officers, including a description of all other benefits granted to Taro's directors and officers that will take effect if the Merger is consummated.  
5.    We are exercising our legal right as shareholders of Taro to review all of the relevant information in connection with the Merger and the Previous Offer in order to ensure that we make an informed decision as shareholders at the Company's Shareholders Meeting, which will be convened to vote upon the Merger.
6.    Please send copies of all Related Documents to our counsel at Herzog Fox & Neeman copied to this letter below. 
7.    This letter does not derogate or exhaust any of our rights, including the right to assert a claim for any damages or seek any fees and costs we may sustain or incur, including attorneys' fees, in enforcing our legal rights as Taro shareholders.
Sincerely,

Did Sun and Taro Under-Report 3rd Quarter Results by Gaming Reserves?

NEW YORK, Nov. 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- IsZo Capital Management LP, one of the largest minority shareholders of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:   TARO), announced today that it delivered the following letter to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Taro, citing evidence that raises the question of whether Taro's management may be under-reporting Taro's third quarter net sales data by artificially inflating reserves for product returns, chargebacks, rebates and other sales-related items, just a month ahead of the special meeting of Taro shareholders to vote upon the proposed merger with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (BSE: SUNPHARMA) at the grossly inadequate below-market price of $39.50 per Taro share. 
Re:   3rd Quarter Financial Results; 
Did Taro Under-Report 3rd Quarter Results by Gaming Reserves? 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Recently, rumors have been circulating that Taro and Sun were intentionally trying to understate their financial results by over-reserving; all ahead of the special December 6th shareholder meeting to vote upon the Sun merger.  We have been busy using our forensic accounting skills and broad industry knowledge attempting to evaluate the veracity of these rumors.  To our dismay, Taro and Sun delivered such evidence with the reported 3rd quarter financial results; results suspiciously inconsistent with readily available commercial sources of Taro's prescription and sales data. 
Taro's reported financials and IMS's reporting of Taro's sales have had nearly perfect correlation over the last year until Taro's 3rd quarter results.  Based on IMS reported data, Taro should have reported net sales of $176.4 mm vs. the $160.9 mm that Taro reported.  So Taro's results are missing roughly $15.4 mm of sales and a similar amount of EBITDA and Profit.  For example, Taro reported QOQ growth of 1% vs. IMS's 11%.
It's easier to see this in table form, bearing in mind that capture rate ("Capture %") per quarter is defined as IMS reported net sales divided by Taro reported net sales. Differences between IMS and Taro sales should be due to rebates, chargebacks, returns, reserves, etc. 





Q3 2011


Q4 2011


Q1 2012


Q2 2012


Q3 2012



IMS Reported Sales ($mm)


204,426


216,349


213,840


234,540


260,202



Taro Reported Sales ($mm)


138,250


148,110


145,140


159,152


160,974



Capture %


67.63%


68.46%


67.87%


67.86%


61.87%

Clearly, Taro's recently reported Q3 2012 numbers are inconsistent with the historic correlation between IMS and Taro net sales data, substantiating market rumors that Taro is gaming its reserves for returned products and similar items to artificially deflate net sales data, conveniently, just a month prior to the December 6th special shareholder meeting to vote upon the proposed Sun merger.
Without this apparent change in product reserves, Taro should have reported $176.5 mm of sales and 110.5 mm of EBITDA for the 3rd quarter.  Consistent with underreporting actual financial results, management has also grossly under-forecasted future Taro results.  In Taro's 13E-3, management's projections for the 6 months ended 2012 were EBITDA of $112.9 mm.  Based on IMS sales data, it looks like management will be roughly 100% too low in its 6 month projections.   Even using reported EBITDA, management is 68% too low for its forecast.  Given that Taro management's 6 month 2012 forecast will be between 68% and most likely 100% too low, we don't believe that the Special Committee and Citigroup can rely on management's projections.
Dilip Shanghvi appears tired of being famous and prefers to join the founding Levy family in becoming infamous.  Despite Shanghvi's promises filed publicly several times in SEC 13Ds to protect minority shareholders, Taro's minority shareholders have and continue to face the unprecedented threat of a take under.  In addition, Taro has refused to allow minority shareholders to verify the results of the voting at the December 2011 shareholder meeting, in violation of Israeli law.  To date, IsZo capital and other minority shareholders have not been able to identify any minority shareholders that voted for the indemnification provisions at the December 2011 meeting.  Taro has also refused minority shareholder document requests regarding the Sun merger in violation of Israeli law.  And most egregiously, the Special Committee has relied on a financial advisor that is clearly not independent under Israeli law.  Furthermore, the Special Committee and its non-independent financial advisor continue to rely on financial projections that are clearly wrong.  In addition, despite our diligent efforts, we can't find a single minority shareholder that supports the Sun merger.  
2013 will be the 5th calendar year that IsZo capital and its predecessors will be Taro shareholders.  We are more excited than ever on Taro's future.  Taro is currently the #1 Generic Dermatology Company in the U.S.; and the recent EU-Israel legislation doubles the market opportunity available to Taro without almost any additional cost.  We are very confident that in the long term, great financial reward will accrue to Taro's minority shareholders if the Sun merger offer is rejected.
Sincerely,





/s/ Brian Sheehy

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
