Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
