Company Summary


JMP Securities is a full-service investment bank that provides equity research, institutional brokerage and investment banking services to growth companies and their investors.

Headquartered in San Francisco, JMP Securities was founded in January 2000 in response to the consolidation of established independent research boutiques by large commercial banks. Since the mid-1990s nearly 50 regional investment banks--including San Francisco's Montgomery Securities, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson Stephens--have been acquired by major financial institutions. Such industry consolidation has pressured a new breed of bulge-bracket investment banks to compete for large market-capitalization clients and has greatly reduced Wall Street's focus on the middle market. JMP Securities was formed in the mold of its independent, research-driven predecessors as a growth-oriented, entrepreneurial firm dedicated to serving the needs of small and midsized companies and the institutions that invest in them.

Today JMP Securities specializes in four broad growth industries: Technology, Healthcare, Financial Services and Real Estate. Many of JMP's senior professionals previously held ranking positions at leading investment banks, and this collective experience is reflected in the firm's results.

Equity research forms the backbone of the firm. JMP's research department covers primarily small and mid-cap public companies and identifies winning opportunities for investors. JMP's senior research analysts are charged with developing proprietary investment themes, anticipating secular and cyclical changes and producing action-oriented reports.

JMP's institutional sales and trading platform provides insight to institutional brokerage clients who rely on JMP's informed, differentiated investment recommendations. Together the firm's sales and trading professionals form a powerful distribution network with exceptional client focus.

JMP prides itself not only on its capital markets sophistication and underwriting capabilities but also on its ability to provide timely, knowledgeable strategic advice and creative financing solutions. The firm's investment banking group is composed of seasoned professionals, each with proven expertise and long-standing industry relationships.

In just eleven years, JMP Securities has established itself as a premier institutional brokerage and middle-market investment banking platform. The firm's tremendous success is due to the spirit and excellence of its people and the support of its clients. We invite you to learn more about our company and our culture of achievement.
