Tableau Software (/tæbˈloʊ/ tab-LOH) is a software company[2] headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States which produces interactive data visualization products[3] focused on business intelligence.[4] It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[5] It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes.[6] The product queries relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types.
Tableau has a mapping functionality,[7][8] and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates.[9] It has been criticized for being overly US-centric.[10] They also offer custom geocoding,[11] as well as five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use.[12] Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015.[13]

Public company[edit]
On May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange,[14] raising more than $250 million USD.[15] Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as NEA and Meritech.[15]
The company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million.[16] In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.[17] The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in October, 2003, where it remains headquartered today.[18] In August 2016, Tableau announced the appointment of Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16, 2016, replacing co-founder Christian Chabot as CEO.[19]
Wikileaks and policy changes[edit]

Population pyramid created by Tableau Software


On December 2, 2010, Tableau withdrew its visualizations from the contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, with Tableau stating that it was directly due to political pressure from US Senator Joe Lieberman.[20][21]
On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[22] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[23] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[23] Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tableau Software has won awards including "Best Overall in Data Visualization" by DM Review, "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" by PC Magazine,[25] and "2008 Best Business Intelligence Solution (CODiE award)" by the Software & Information Industry Association.[26]

            About
          

            Leadership
          



    Board members Chris Stolte, Pat Hanrahan and Christian Chabot founded Tableau with a simple mission: help people see and understand their data. Our world-class leaders have the ingredients to deliver on that mission. Along with our entire Board of Directors, their passion, experience and dedication make Tableau a great place to work. And they love working with customers.
  














Adam Selipsky
President and CEO

      Adam Selipsky is the President and CEO at Tableau. He sets the vision and direction for Tableau, and oversees all company strategy, business activities and operations. Selipsky spent over a decade building Amazon Web Services, one of the most successful technology platforms in the world. His leadership helped grow AWS from a start-up into a multi-billion dollar business and establish it as the undisputed market leader in cloud computing. Selipsky served as Vice President of Marketing, Sales and Support for AWS. Prior to joining Amazon, he was an executive at RealNetworks, leading the video subscription and media player division. Before that, he was a Principal at Mercer Management Consulting, a strategy consulting firm. He holds an A.B. in Government and an MBA from Harvard University.
    
Upon joining Tableau, Adam commented "Tableau has that rare combination of a passionate customer base, leading products, amazingly talented people, dedication to technology innovation, and momentum in the market. I’m honored to join the leadership team and all the great people that have fueled Tableau’s disruption of business analytics."









Tom Walker
CFO
Tom Walker is Tableau's Chief Financial Officer. He is responsible for finance, operations, administration, human resources, and IT functions at Tableau. Tom brings over 19 years of experience in finance, operations, strategic planning, and acquisitions. Prior to joining Tableau in 2004, he held finance positions at private and public companies including Time Warner and IDG Books (since acquired by John Wiley and Sons). He holds a bachelor's degree in finance from Arizona State University, and a master's degree in business administration from Baruch College.
Tom was Tableau's first customer. "When I saw how Tableau helped my previous company with its data analytics challenges, I knew I had to be part of this company." 








Andrew Beers
CDO
Andrew Beers is Tableau's Chief Development Officer, and is responsible for product strategy, design, and engineering. During his tenure at Tableau, he has led many of the engineering teams, created new products for the company, and personally written pieces of the product code. Andrew has been at the very heart of Tableau's engineering for most of the company's existence. Prior to joining Tableau in 2004, Andrew ran the engineering group at Align Technology, makers of the Invisalign system, building software to support large-scale customized manufacturing. He holds a Masters degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, where he worked in Pat Hanrahan's computer graphics research group.
When Andrew was first introduced to a very early version of Tableau Desktop, he knew he had seen the future. "My previous company and I personally were doing data analysis using old, traditional systems that I knew Tableau would replace. But it wasn't until I got to see under the hood that I realized how incredible Tableau really was. VizQL was a technology that I had to get my hands on."








Dan Miller
EVP Sales & Support
Dan Miller is the Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Sales, Services and Support for Tableau. Miller is an industry veteran with 30 years of experience. Most recently, he led the global go-to-market strategy, sales and operations for Oracle’s ISV/OEM and Java businesses.  Previously, he led Juniper’s Enterprise business and spent nearly 20 years at Sun Microsystems where he held a variety of senior sales management positions. As SVP, Global Systems and Storage for Sun, Dan led the server and storage field sales and engineering unit.  Dan also brings to Tableau a global leadership background, including a three-year period as President and Chairman of Sun Microsystems K.K., Sun Microsystem’s subsidiary in Japan. He holds a B.S. in Business with an emphasis in Information Systems and Marketing from the University of Colorado.
When Dan joined Tableau he immediately went out to the field to meet the teams and customers, “It’s been phenomenal to witness the teaming, energy, winning, and results. From Seattle to Palo Alto to Dallas to Washington D.C. to New York to London to Paris to Frankfurt, it’s been inspiring getting to know how the team has created a passionate following in a unique Tableau way and I’m so excited to continue to cultivate that energy with the entire team.”








Elissa Fink
CMO
Elissa Fink is Tableau's Chief Marketing Officer. With 20+ years helping companies improve their marketing operations through applied data analysis, Elissa has held executive positions in marketing, business strategy, product management, and product development. Prior to Tableau, Elissa was EVP Marketing at IXI Corporation, now owned by Equifax. She has also served in executive positions at Tele Atlas (acquired by TomTom), TopTier Software (acquired by SAP), and Nielsen/Claritas. Elissa also sold national advertising for the Wall Street Journal. She's a frequent speaker and has spoken at conferences including the DMA, NCDM, PSAMA and others. Elissa is a graduate of Santa Clara University and holds an MBA in Marketing and Decision Systems from the University of Southern California. In 2013, Elissa joined the Board of the Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA).
Elissa first discovered Tableau late one afternoon at her previous company. Three hours later, she was still "at play" with her data. "After just a few minutes using the product, I was getting answers to questions that were taking my previous company's programmers weeks to create. It was instantly obvious that Tableau was on a special mission with something unique to offer the world. I just had to be a part of it."








Francois Ajenstat
CPO

He is also responsible for evangelizing Tableau's products with customers and partners and incorporating customer and partner feedback into the strategic vision of the Tableau portfolio. Francois brings a wealth of product management experience in the business intelligence industry. Prior to joining Tableau, Francois worked at Microsoft for 10 years in a number of different groups including SQL Server, Office and Trustworthy Computing. Before that, he worked for Cognos Corporation (acquired by IBM) leading strategic alliances with key industry partners such as IBM, HP, and Microsoft.
The first time Francois saw Tableau, over 10 years ago, he recognized the potential to transform the industry and revolutionize how people work with data. "I knew I needed to be part of what was to become an entire new era in business analytics and it's been incredible to be part of the team that is making that vision a reality."








Jay Peir
Executive VP, Corporate Development and Strategy

He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in electrical engineering, and an MBA from Stanford University.
While at SunPower, Jay had the opportunity to work with individuals determined to make solar a meaningful part of our global energy mix.  "I saw that same passion and desire to make a difference at Tableau and knew I had to be a part of the company that is revolutionizing how people see and understand data."








Keenan Conder

He also held positions at Travelocity.com and Sabre Inc.  He began his legal career as a commercial litigator and is a graduate of Wake Forest University Law School.
Keenan has experienced first-hand the acute problems people face in trying to analyze data productively. "Tableau's mission of making data easy to see and understand can be fundamentally game-changing – as it accelerates the time from data analysis to data utilization. I am honored to be a part of the team."

GeekWire Summit: Early-bird tickets here!

For the first time since it launched nearly 14 years ago, Tableau Software has a new leader.
The Seattle-based data analytics and visualization company just announced that Amazon Web Services veteran Adam Selipsky will become Tableau’s new CEO, effective Sept. 16.

Christian Chabot, who co-founded Tableau in 2003 and ran the company as CEO since then, will remain as chairman.
In an interview on Monday with GeekWire, Chabot called Selipsky a “sensational new leader,” pointing to his experience at Amazon, where he helped grow the company’s cloud computing arm from the ground floor into a business that is now on track to generate $10 billion per year in sales.
GeekWire previously reported last week that Selipsky had left Amazon — now we know where the longtime Amazon executive and former RealNetworks vice president is headed.
“Clearly, that has been a sensational success,” Chabot said of AWS, calling it one of the ‘most successful tech platforms’ in the world. “Adam will be helping lead Tableau through a similar journey, hopefully.”
[Follow up: Why Tableau just hired Amazon Web Services guru Adam Selipsky to be its new CEO]
In a statement, Selipsky said that he is “incredibly excited” to join Tableau. An SEC filing shows that he will earn an annual base salary of $500,000 and will be eligible for an annual incentive bonus of up to 100 percent of that base salary. He will also receive a cash signing bonus of $1 million.
“Tableau has that rare combination of a passionate customer base, leading products, amazingly talented people, dedication to technology innovation, and momentum in the market,” said the 49-year-old. “The company is positioned to become the new world standard in analytics. I’m honored to join the leadership team and all the great people that have fueled Tableau’s disruption of business analytics. As we add capabilities for our customers, deepen our enterprise presence, and expand into the cloud, our mission remains unchanged — to help people see and understand their data.”

The executive shuffle comes during a rocky year for Tableau on Wall Street. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company posted a record $203 million in revenue, but took a $41 million loss. As a result, its stock lost about half its value and has yet to fully recover. The company’s stock fell again the following quarter and has dropped nearly 50 percent in the past year, now trading at $54.87.
Tableau, which is facing increased competition in the data analytics industry, also scaled back hiring plans by 50 percent earlier this year.
Asked about the timing of the leadership changes, Chabot said the 3,200-person company (60 percent of employees are based in the Seattle area) is “well positioned for its next stage — becoming one of the most important technology companies on the planet.”
“We have not expanded our leadership team since before our IPO in 2013, and since then, the company and opportunity have grown tremendously,” he said. “These moves expand our executive ranks and positions us well for our next stage of growth.”
Shares of Tableau are up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.
The hiring of Selipsky also points to Tableau’s new focus on its cloud product, Tableau Online.
Chris Stolte.
“Our expansion in cloud is particularly germane to the next five years — it’s more important to the next five years than the last five years,” Chabot said. “In fact, one of the reasons we recruited Adam is his exceptional expertise in the cloud. I wouldn’t be surprised if he decides to really supersize that part of the strategy.”
Tableau co-founder and chief development officer Chris Stolte will also step down from his leadership position and transition to “technical advisor.” Andrew Beers, Tableau’s seventh employee who was most recently vice president of product development, will replace Stolte as the company’s new chief development officer.
Chabot said that he and Stolte, who started Tableau in Silicon Valley in 2003 before moving the company to Seattle a few years later, will spend more time focused on long-term strategy and customer evangelism — “areas where we can have the biggest impact,” he noted.
“Chris and I will be assisting Adam and the executive team in the areas where we are best at,” Chabot added.
Tableau went public in 2013.
Despite the decreasing stock price, Chabot said that Tableau is “one of the fastest-growing technology companies out there,” noting that it closed more new accounts during Q2 than any quarter in its history. He added that Tableau, which has more than 46,000 customer accounts, “has a very small share” of the visual data and analytics market, pinning it at about 5 percent.
“Tableau’s size and scale continues to increase,” Chabot said. “As we look forward into next year and the 5-year plan, it seems like an opportune time to have the best of both worlds: bring in additional executive leadership for a much bigger company, while also focusing me and Chris on the things we most enjoy and do best.”
This past May, Chabot hinted that he wanted to bring on a president or COO, but it wasn’t clear then that he would ultimately step down as CEO. Tableau sales chief Kelly Wright, who helped build the company into a data visualization powerhouse, will retire at the end of this year. There is no longer a search for a president, but the company is still searching for a new sales chief, Chabot said today.
Chabot on Monday also explained how successful software companies come in three acts: going from $0 to $100 million in annual revenue, going from $100 million to $1 billion, and then beyond.
He said Tableau, which just launched Tableau 10 and has 16 offices worldwide, is nearing the end of Act 2, closing in on $1 billion in annual sales — its guidance for 2016 revenue is more than $800 million.
“The question for our board, which has been thinking about this for some time, was what our ‘Act 3’ plan was, and if we were going for it or not,” Chabot explained. “We are going for it.”
Tableau’s stock over the past year.

Shares of Tableau plunge nearly 50% after company posts $41M loss in Q4

Shares of Tableau Software fell more than 35 percent in after-hours trading Thursday after the data visualization company reported a $41 million loss for the fourth quarter. (Update 9:30 a.m. Friday: The shares continued to fall on Friday morning, down more than 45 percent).
Analysts expected earnings of $0.16 per share, but Tableau posted a loss of $0.57 per share. The Seattle-based company reported a record $203 million in revenue, which narrowly beat expectations of $200 million and was up 42 percent from last year.

“In Q4, a record 3,600 new customer accounts chose Tableau, bringing our total to more than 39,000 worldwide,” Tableau CEO Christian Chabot said in a statement. “This speaks to the immense popularity of Tableau’s products and continued strong demand from customers around the world. I remain optimistic that Tableau is best positioned to address the large and growing market opportunity for self-service visual analytics.”
In the year-ago quarter, Tableau posted net income of $20.7 million on earnings of $0.30 per share. During Q3 2015, the company reported $170.8 million in revenue, beating analyst expectations, but missed on earnings expectations with a net loss of $0.19 per share.
In an earnings call with financial analysts, Tableau CFO Tom Walker said that customer acquisition is “quite strong” with 39,000 customer accounts, but he said they saw some “softness in spend” with larger customers in the fourth quarter.  “It was not at the same clip that we saw historically,” said Walker, especially as it related to the strong fourth quarter in 2014.
Chabot added that Tableau is well positioned with its data visualization tools, since it operates a “hybrid model” where customers can choose to purchase products on-site for their own data centers or purchase cloud-based offerings. While he’s bullish on the prospects going forward, Chabot added that it is “too early to say that there is some pause” that has impacted Tableau. Over the years, Chabot said that the competitive landscape has gotten “more crowded and more difficult.”
“It has gotten thicker and thicker over the years,” said Chabot, adding that the company’s “win rates” remain stable against rivals. Microsoft launched its PowerBI data analytics tool last summer, creating a new competitive threat for Tableau.
Chabot said that Tableau has the most robust data visualization product on the market, and it is competitively priced versus the competition. But he admitted that the lower-priced alternatives may have had a minor role in the softness that Tableau experienced.

“The large number of competitive alternatives that are available for customers to check out versus a few years ago probably had some role in expansion ratios,” said Chabot. “It is very hard to measure that from our perch…. I will leave you with the hypothesis that the number of things that customers are checking out has increased, probably played some role, but it doesn’t feel to us that is an overwhelming factor.”
Even so, Tableau plans to continue investing heavily in building out its marketing, sales and engineering force, taking advantage of what the company believes is an enormous opportunity.
“We have seen a lot of competitors get attracted to the overall market space, and so it is very, very important for us to recognize … what a rich opportunity it is and how much beyond (business intelligence) it is, and so we want to continue to go and be the leader there. And we think the best way to do that is through investing,” said Walker. “There will be a time when we don’t think the opportunity is as rich, and I believe that is when we would turn towards more operating leverage in the model. But right now we are actually bullish on the overall opportunity, and the long-term opportunity.” He said they are focused on growing to more than $1 billion in top-line revenue in the next few years.
Chabot told GeekWire in December that his 3,008-person company planned to grow by another 1,000 workers in 2016. It hired 1,051 net employees last year. Tableau now occupies or has inked leases at 10 buildings in the Seattle area — seven in Fremont, and three in Kirkland. The company already employs 1,200 in the region, and will add another 600 in 2016 alone.
Looking ahead, Tableau expects to bring in $160 million to $165 million in revenue for Q1 2016, and annual revenue of $830 to $850 million for 2016 as a whole — up 30 percent year-over-year.
Here’s the full press release:

SEATTLE, Feb. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Tableau Software, Inc. (NYSE: DATA) today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

International revenue grew to $53.7 million, up 63% year over year.
Added more than 3,600 new customer accounts.
Closed 414 transactions greater than $100,000, up 36% year over year.
Diluted GAAP net loss per share was $0.57; diluted non-GAAP net income per share was $0.33.
Recognized a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets of $46.7 million.

License revenue grew to $423.8 million, up 51% year over year.
International revenue grew to $164.3 million, up 75% year over year.
Added more than 12,500 new customer accounts.
Closed 1,192 transactions greater than $100,000, up 53% year over year.
Diluted GAAP net loss per share was $1.17; diluted non-GAAP net income per share was $0.62.

“In Q4, a record 3,600 new customer accounts chose Tableau, bringing our total to more than 39,000 worldwide. This speaks to the immense popularity of Tableau’s products and continued strong demand from customers around the world,” said Christian Chabot, Chief Executive Officer of Tableau. “I remain optimistic that Tableau is best positioned to address the large and growing market opportunity for self-service visual analytics.”
Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2015
Total revenue increased 42% to $202.8 million, up from $142.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. License revenue increased 31% to $133.1 million, up from $101.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. International revenue grew to$53.7 million, up 63% from $32.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
GAAP operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $7.1 million, compared to a GAAP operating income of $16.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $41.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, compared to a GAAP net income of $20.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014.
The fourth quarter income tax expense was $34.1 million due to the recognition of a valuation allowance. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $46.7 million on the deferred tax assets relating to these jurisdictions. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the income tax benefit was $12.7 million for the fourth quarter primarily as a result of the permanent extension of the federal R&D tax credit.
Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was $30.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $31.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related income tax adjustments, was$26.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, or $0.33 per diluted common share, compared to a non-GAAP net income of $31.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014.
Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015
Total revenue increased 58% to $653.6 million, up from $412.6 million in 2014. License revenue increased 51% to$423.8 million, up from $279.9 million in 2014. International revenue grew to $164.3 million, up 75% from $93.8 million in 2014.
GAAP operating loss for 2015 was $52.0 million, compared to a GAAP operating income of $6.3 million for 2014. GAAP net loss for 2015 was $83.7 million, or $1.17 per diluted common share, compared to a GAAP net income of$5.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share, for 2014.
Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was $67.4 million for 2015, compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $53.3 million for 2014. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related income tax adjustments, was $48.1 million for 2015, or $0.62 per diluted common share, compared to a non-GAAP net income of $38.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted common share, for 2014.

Christopher Stolte is a co-founder of Tableau and served as its original Chief Development Officer from inception until August 2016. It was Dr. Stolte’s seminal work as a Ph.D. candidate in the Stanford University Computer Science department that formed the basis of the patented technology behind Tableau, VizQL. Working with Professor Pat Hanrahan, Stolte developed VizQL as the core invention of his thesis project, Polaris. Funded by a Department of Defense (DOD) project, Polaris aimed at increasing people’s ability to analyze information visually. In 2003, Stolte, together with Hanrahan and Christian Chabot, decided to commercialize Polaris under the name Tableau Software. Chris then led product development at Tableau for 13 years. He has served as a member of our board of directors since 2003. His early career as a database programmer helped him see the problems with existing data analysis tools.
Chris currently serves as Tableau’s Technical Advisor. Prior to joining us, he was the Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of BeeLine LLC. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University and a B.S. from Simon Fraser University.
