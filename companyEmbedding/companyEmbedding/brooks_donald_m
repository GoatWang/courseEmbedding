#WinningCombos: pair a white non-iron shirt with a metallic skirt like @t_doriana








Wednesday, you've been served. Channeling our inner @johnrisner from the #delltechopen last weekend








A spread collar is best when you must dress to impress. The extra space accommodates a larger tie knot such as a half or full windsor. #WednesdayWisdom
(📸: @tysevere)








Hang on tight— these @RedFleece silk camis will slip right through your fingers if you wait #TapToShop








Today's #TieTuesday pick: A Golden Fleece Textured Wool Tie worn by @matthewzorpas. The subtle check pattern gives it a textured look and feel. Made from 100% wool woven in Italy and expertly crafted in New York City.

Investing carries risk. Investment means that your capital is at risk and that there is no certainty that you will receive your capital back or that a positive return on your investment will be made. Past performance is no guide to future performance. There is no guarantee that the tax efficient nature of any investment will remain. Investment may not be suitable for everybody and potential investors should take their own independent advice.

My Go To Shoe!


										2017/07/20 | Nashville | ScottK


At work or when I run, these are the shoes for me. I love the fact there's been very little change in the design the last few years.  This is my 17th pair and I will continue to buy them as long as they are available.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

i would buy this again


										2017/07/20 | New Jersey | Runs like the Wind


performing as advertised.  lots of cushioning and spring.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

sleek design - just needs improved grip for the outsole


										2017/07/16 | NYC | Zac - everyday


Great aesthetics. Only qualm is the grip of the outsole, specifically in wet weather conditions. Slightly less grip than a NB pair of shoes, but aesthetically more pleasing.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

Extremely comfortable shoe


										2017/07/15 | Pittsburgh Pa | Bucky


I don't run but walk 3 to 4 miles a day.
This is the best shoe I have ever owned..I knew it the moment I tried them on..
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★

Best Running Shoe I have Ever Owned


										2017/07/11 | Chicago | JMS


I suffer from shin splints and have tried other support shoes from competitors. Nothing compares to this shoe.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

Great shoe!


										2017/07/11 | Forney, TX | Donald the Marine


So light, it's almost like it's not there. Tongue is a tad wider than the Beast, which I like.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

Same great shoe...only snugger.


										2017/07/06 | Rochester, NY | Goldy


I've been wearing the Adrenaline GTS series for at least 4 years. I use this running shoe for its versatility. I'm not a runner, but the great cushioning helps my knees and hips when I walk, work or occasionally shoot hoops (not play basketball; just shoot hoops). 
The only drawback to the 2017 model is it seems a little snugger (in length) than previous versions, but not enough to return for a larger size. Unless my feet grew, which doesn't seem to be the case as my other footwear fit fine.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

Happy overall


										2017/07/06 | Salem, OR | Happy Customer


This shoe is really comfortable with a great deal of support.  The support is there without being overly corrective. Nice shoe.  The only thing I would change is the interior height of the shoe. I could use a little more room in the middle of the shoe.  I struggle with  toe pain and arch pain.  Brooks is the only shoe that works for me.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

First time buying a REAL running shoe


										2017/07/06 | Minneapolis, MN | Erik the GOAT


I've always enjoyed running but never invested in an actual running shoe until now, it has held up well to running upwards of 40 miles a week and has been perfect for training for my first marathon. Fairly light while giving plenty of support. Looks good, feels fast.
Yes, I would recommend this!











★★★★★
★★★★★

Unbelievablely comfortable!


										2017/07/04 | Dallas, tx | Dave H.


I took these on vacation with me because I knew I would be walking at least 5-10 miles a day on rough cobblestone roads.  They worked out better than I anticipated!  These are an excellent pair of shoes,
Yes, I would recommend this!

#WinningCombos: pair a white non-iron shirt with a metallic skirt like @t_doriana








Wednesday, you've been served. Channeling our inner @johnrisner from the #delltechopen last weekend








A spread collar is best when you must dress to impress. The extra space accommodates a larger tie knot such as a half or full windsor. #WednesdayWisdom
(📸: @tysevere)








Hang on tight— these @RedFleece silk camis will slip right through your fingers if you wait #TapToShop








Today's #TieTuesday pick: A Golden Fleece Textured Wool Tie worn by @matthewzorpas. The subtle check pattern gives it a textured look and feel. Made from 100% wool woven in Italy and expertly crafted in New York City.

In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
