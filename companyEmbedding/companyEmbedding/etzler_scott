Kelley Love Runs Deep for InterCall President
Scott Etzler BS'75
President, Intercall

 
�Kelley graduates have that good Midwest work ethic coupled with the right academic underpinnings. They don�t just work hard�they work smart."

Read about other corporate partners >>

Scott Etzler is one of the Center for Global Sales Leadership�s biggest champions. And one of its most prominent.
Etzler is President of InterCall, the world�s largest provider of audio, video, and Web-based business services. The company brings in over $1 billion in revenue every year. InterCall serves over 400,000 individual conference leaders in more than 40,000 organizations around the globe, with 26 U.S. sales offices and a global reach that extends from Canada to the United Kingdom to India and more.
Etzler knows the value of a Kelley education�having earned his degree there in 1975�and he makes sure InterCall�s recruiters visit Kelley. When a potential new hire�s resume reflects experience with the Center for Global Sales Leadership and its student group, the Global Sales Workshop, Etzler knows he has found a top-notch employee.
InterCall is also a corporate sponsor of the Center, which gives the firm access to top students who have the desire to become successful sales leaders�just what InterCall needs to maintain its dominance in the field, says Etzler.
�InterCall is a sales and marketing driven company, and we have become the largest provider in the world because we have the best sales and marketing people working for us,� says Etzler. �IU has provided InterCall with exceptional sales talent for years, and the center offers us the opportunity for an even closer tie-in to IU�s highly-trained students. We have a great deal of belief in the product that the Kelley School of Business brings forward�and we definitely look for that center experience on resumes when we�re interviewing.�
InterCall recruits from many universities, but Etzler says that Indiana University is one of their favorite places to discover new talent. Each year, the company hires 15 to 20 IU graduates, most from Kelley. And those grads tend to stick around�and ascend through the ranks. After all, Etzler himself is Kelley graduate as are InterCall�s executive vice president of sales and the executive vice president of marketing and business development. Coincidence? Hardly.
�Kelley graduates have that good Midwest work ethic coupled with the right academic underpinnings. They don�t just work hard�they work smart,� says Etzler.

In Their Words
"The benefits of partnering with the IU Global Sales Workshop have been tremendous for InterCall. Through the various interactive events the Workshop hosts, we have been able to see how the students operate in a breadth of situations and been able to determine how well they could represent our company as new hires."
Maria Isabella Aiello
International Project Manager
InterCall
 


The Center for Global Sales Leadership is where corporations come to find outstanding sales and marketing talent—and where students come to learn the most innovative methods for success in a sales career.
When our corporate partners talk, we listen. We strive to anticipate their needs and even craft our curriculum to reflect current selling and sales management best practices and trends. Here are the benefits of corporate partnership:

Gain access to Kelley's best and brightest students. Only the top students are admitted to the Global Sales Workshop, and our corporate partners have many opportunities to recruit them for internships and jobs.
Shape sales curriculum. Firms that partner with the center are invited to become involved with sales courses, especially through presentations and case studies.
Increase your sales goals. By hiring a Kelley student who has been active with the center, you'll get an ambitious self-starter who already has real-world selling experience and will become an instant asset to your firm.

We also listen to our students, of course. We work to increase their interest in professional sales and sales management careers, and we provide a wealth of opportunities to nurture this budding sales talent.

About Us
Shaping the Future Sales Force
Established in 1996, the Center for Global Sales Leadership is one of the nation�s first educational sales research centers located at a nationally ranked business school. Funded exclusively through corporate sponsorship, the Center works closely with its sponsors to create programs and events that get students excited about careers in professional selling and sales management. By investing in the Center, corporations are connected to students who may one day make significant contributions to their organization.
By bringing students, faculty, and business leaders together, the Center:

shapes Kelley's curriculum to reflect real-world sales and business practices
discusses contemporary issues facing the sales force
engages professional sales people in student networking and learning activities

At the heart of our success is the stellar reputation and rankings of the Kelley School of Business, a world-renowned marketing faculty, highly successful students who are the �best of the best,� and strategic partnerships with leaders in the business sector.
Our success depends on our ability to listen to and anticipate the needs of our corporate partners, and to develop relationships with new ones. After all, we are in the business of connecting tomorrow's sales leaders, our students, with the world's top corporations, our sponsors.
Top Students = Top Employees
The Kelley School of Business has a solid history for developing top-notch students for sales and marketing positions with the world�s most successful companies. More than half of our undergraduate marketing majors, as well as students in other majors, pursue careers in sales � that's about 200 students every year who graduate and go on to numerous careers in professional sales, such as New Business Development, Account Management, Distribution Sales, Consultive System Sales, Relationship Sales and System Specialists.
Outstanding students are encouraged to apply for membership in the exclusive Global Sales Workshop. Funded by the Center, this student-run group connects Kelley undergraduates with sales professionals to learn about real-world opportunities as well as challenges and expectations through case studies, round-table discussions, and networking events such as etiquette dinners and corporate tours and lunches.
Our Sales Cred
Our affiliations with the world's biggest corporations and Kelley's top-ranked marketing department are the secrets to our success, and we have the accreditation to prove it:

A certified collegiate sales program in the University Sales Center Alliance (USCA)
Sales curriculum certified by the Professional Society for Sales & Marketing Training (SMT)
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)
2009 HR Chally-verified as a top University Sales Education Program by University Sales Education Foundation
