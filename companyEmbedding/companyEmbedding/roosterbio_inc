Share Article

















Well-characterized and high-volume living cell systems provide engineered solutions for rapid product development and commercial translation






Frederick, MD (PRWEB)
April 09, 2015
 Based upon strong market demand, RoosterBio Inc has announced the commercial launch of RoosterVial-hBM-50M MSC, a single vial containing 50 million human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. This unprecedented, ultra-high cell number product configuration enables Regenerative Medicine organizations to accelerate scale-up and product development activities. RoosterBio’s core technology, which includes cell and media systems, allows tissue engineers, biofabricators, 3D bioprinters and cell therapy developers to instantly scale up, using simplified and standardized methods.
The 50 million hMSC vial delivers immediate cell biomass without the need for prior expansion. This results in saving significant time, resources and expense during bioprocess scale-up optimization. Since the system contains the most well-characterized hMSCs available on the market, the industry is assured robust and reproducible results. As with other RoosterBio products, this 50 million cell product is capable of greater than 100-fold expansion (>5 billion cells) within two weeks when cultured in RoosterBio medium. Prior to this technology, obtaining such cell numbers so rapidly was virtually impossible.
RoosterBio continues to broaden their portfolio of product formats, providing solutions for an extensive range of Regenerative Medicine therapeutic categories. The evolving product portfolio enables researchers and product developers to perform small scale screening studies, large scale development studies, and now, scale-up manufacturing bioprocess experiments using the 50 million cell product. Rapid prototyping of 3D bioprinted tissues utilizing hMSCs as the primary component of the cellular “bioink” is also now achievable. The Company offers various product configurations including 1 million cell vials, 10 million cell vials, and high performance media systems, as well as pre-assembled working cell banks and kits for rapidly achieving stem cell biomass.
Jon Rowley, CEO of RoosterBio stated: "The Industry has published a technology roadmap for scalable cell manufacturing and 3D bioprinting, yet the materials needed to test and implement these technologies are not readily available. RoosterBio is addressing this major roadblock with innovative product formats that enable users to do more work, faster, and with much less out-of-pocket expense."
RoosterBio’s mission is to accelerate the development and commercialization of Regenerative Medicine products, by providing standardized stem cell product platforms that enable rapid translation of discoveries into product development.

RoosterBio Inc. Launches Industry’s First Ready-to-Print Stem Cell Product



Share Article


















Ready-to-use mesenchymal stem cell reagent enables effortless 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering.










Frederick, Maryland (PRWEB)
October 19, 2015
 RoosterBio Inc today announces the commercial launch of the industry’s first Ready-to-Print (RTP) stem cell product designed specifically for bioprinters and tissue engineers, removing weeks of time from the cellular bioprinting process. The healthcare industry is trying to swiftly capitalize on additive manufacturing technologies, also referred to as 3D printing. Whether developers are creating prosthetic limbs or using living cells to bioprint human tissues and organs, experiments in this industry are progressing at a remarkable pace. RoosterBio’s 50 million cell RTP format is an unprecedented stem cell product configuration that provides significant quantities of high quality human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) in a uniquely designed format to simplify and standardize the most complex and labor intensive aspects of bioprinting. 
The most significant challenge in the advancement of 3D bioprinting is the scarce availability of living cellular biomaterials for printing. RoosterBio’s RTP product allows bioprinters and tissue engineers to thaw and use stem cells for same day experiments, avoiding time-, labor- and cost-intensive cell expansion processes.  By simply thawing and using hMSCs, scientists can minimize time between experiments for rapid experimental turn-around and publication.  Furthermore, the highly standardized starting cellular materials will minimize experimental variability.  This innovative product format allows users to take advantage of RoosterBio’s economies of scale to obtain hMSCs at a fraction of the cost of any other cell systems on the market.  This new product reinforces RoosterBio’s commitment to engineering solutions which remove complexity from adult stem cell research and accelerate customers’ product development efforts.  RoosterRTP-hBM-50M was unveiled at the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society (TERMIS) World Congress in Boston, MA from September 8-11, 2015, where the rapid development of the bioprinting industry was on full display. 
Erik Gatenholm, CEO of CELLINK stated:
“The 3D Bioprinting field is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing scientific areas today. 3D Bioprinting can be explained through the utilization of three components, namely: a 3D Bioprinter, a bioink or hydrogel, and human cells. Currently, generating human cells is a significant bottleneck due to the time needed to culture expand cells for the bioprinting process. With the RoosterBio RTP stem cells, this is no longer the case.  The cells can be thawed and used immediately.  Now, we can finally offer our customers complete ready-to-use solutions. The RTP cells will fast-track bioprinting research and discovery.” 
RoosterBio’s mission is to accelerate the development and commercialization of Regenerative Medicine products, by providing standardized stem cell product platforms that enable rapid translation of discoveries into product development.

Frederick, Maryland (PRWEB)
July 06, 2017
 RoosterBio Inc, today, announces the launch of RoosterReplenish™-MSC-XF, a first-in-class bioreactor feed designed to economically and rapidly scale up 3D culture of its standardized, well-characterized high-quality bioprocess hMSC (human mesenchymal stem/stromal cell) banks. At a CAGR of 23.2% and estimated revenue of $68B by 2020, the Regenerative Medicine (“RM”) industry calls for scalable product platforms that efficiently enable commercialization.
RoosterReplenish-MSC-XF offers an integrated approach to the complex challenges of hMSC suspension cell culture scale-up. The industry’s first Xeno-free (XF) hMSC bioreactor feed, RoosterReplenish-MSC-XF rounds out RoosterBio’s development grade product portfolio to support both suspension and adherent cell culture. A fed-batch culture system removes the need to perform costly and labor-intensive half or full media exchanges and significantly improves the productivity of XF media over traditional batch culture methods (millions of cells produced per Liter of media consumed in 2D and 3D culture). This minimizes media usage, further reduces costs associated with hMSC culture scale-up, streamlines culture processes and mitigates risk introduced by process interventions.
Translational scientists and process and product developers moving towards clinical translation, and eventual commercialization, require robust, reproducible, scalable cell culture manufacturing platforms that lower regulatory burden and that can be implemented with a commercially-viable Bill of Materials. RoosterBio is accelerating customers’ path to the clinic by obviating the need for lengthy and expensive in-house process development efforts. Rather, RoosterBio provides the customer with high quality cell culture scale-up tools as well as established protocols for the rapid and economical implementation of viable hMSC manufacturing processes. With industry-leading functional characterization and superior cell expansion potential, our cell and media systems bridge the gap between benchtop and bedside by providing a fully XF solution to large scale hMSC manufacturing.
Margot S. Connor, RoosterBio's Chief Executive Officer, states, "RoosterBio continues to fuel the RM industry with product platforms engineered to reach the necessary scale and throughput required for our end-users to approach the clinic. In May this year, we launched XF hMSC banks - and now, a XF bioreactor feed. From small scale assay development all the way through large scale biomanufacturing in suspension, our customers can simply and efficiently drive their development programs. Products like RoosterReplenish-MSC-XF increase overall productivity and easily accommodate process optimization by leveraging our expertise in product and process design. Further, early implementation of a completely Xeno-free workflow streamlines and shortens development timelines for hMSC-based products."
The release of these products reinforces RoosterBio’s ongoing mission to support the acceleration of the Regenerative Medicine industry.

Ready-to-use mesenchymal stem cell reagent enables effortless 3D bioprinting and tissue engineering.
Frederick, Maryland (PRWEB) October 19, 2015 
 RoosterBio Inc today announces the commercial launch of the industry's first Ready-to-Print (RTP) stem cell product designed specifically for bioprinters and tissue engineers, removing weeks of time from the cellular bioprinting process. The healthcare industry is trying to swiftly capitalize on additive manufacturing technologies, also referred to as 3D printing. Whether developers are creating prosthetic limbs or using living cells to bioprint human tissues and organs, experiments in this industry are progressing at a remarkable pace. RoosterBio's 50 million cell RTP format is an unprecedented stem cell product configuration that provides significant quantities of high quality human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) in a uniquely designed format to simplify and standardize the most complex and labor intensive aspects of bioprinting. 
The most significant challenge in the advancement of 3D bioprinting is the scarce availability of living cellular biomaterials for printing. RoosterBio's RTP product allows bioprinters and tissue engineers to thaw and use stem cells for same day experiments, avoiding time-, labor- and cost-intensive cell expansion processes.  By simply thawing and using hMSCs, scientists can minimize time between experiments for rapid experimental turn-around and publication.  Furthermore, the highly standardized starting cellular materials will minimize experimental variability.  This innovative product format allows users to take advantage of RoosterBio's economies of scale to obtain hMSCs at a fraction of the cost of any other cell systems on the market.  This new product reinforces RoosterBio's commitment to engineering solutions which remove complexity from adult stem cell research and accelerate customers' product development efforts.  RoosterRTP-hBM-50M was unveiled at the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society (TERMIS) World Congress in Boston, MA from September 8-11, 2015, where the rapid development of the bioprinting industry was on full display. 
Erik Gatenholm, CEO of CELLINK stated:
"The 3D Bioprinting field is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing scientific areas today. 3D Bioprinting can be explained through the utilization of three components, namely: a 3D Bioprinter, a bioink or hydrogel, and human cells. Currently, generating human cells is a significant bottleneck due to the time needed to culture expand cells for the bioprinting process. With the RoosterBio RTP stem cells, this is no longer the case.  The cells can be thawed and used immediately.  Now, we can finally offer our customers complete ready-to-use solutions. The RTP cells will fast-track bioprinting research and discovery." 
RoosterBio's mission is to accelerate the development and commercialization of Regenerative Medicine products, by providing standardized stem cell product platforms that enable rapid translation of discoveries into product development. For more information, please email Dr. Priya Baraniak at priya(at)roosterbio(dot)com or phone 1-412-606-1160.
