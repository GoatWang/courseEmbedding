Suliman Saleh Olayan (Arabic: سليمان العليان‎‎) (November 5, 1918 – July 4, 2002) was among Saudi Arabia's wealthiest businessmen.

Life and Achievements[edit]
Orphaned at the age of six, Olayan had more humble beginnings than most of his business counterparts from the Kingdom. Olayan's rise to great wealth reflected his acumen, an ability to cross cultural barriers, as well as extraordinary timing.
Over a 55-year career as an independent businessman, he served as entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist. Under his guidance and leadership, the Olayan Group became both a leading diversified enterprise in Saudi Arabia and a major participant in global investing.
The story of his entrepreneurial journey begins in the town of Unayzah in north central Saudi Arabia. For centuries, the town had been a haven for caravans venturing across the Najd, Saudi Arabia's heartland. The merchant families of Unayzah had developed important trading links with the world outside central Arabia - the cities on the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast, which had ties to Africa and Asia.
In 1918, Suliman Olayan was born into one of these merchant families. His father, Saleh, had recently returned from Medina, where he had been a spice trader. Suliman spent the first years of his life in his family's ancestral hometown.
Suliman's mother died just a few months after he was born, and his father died when he was still a child. When he was about 10 years old, Suliman traveled with his older brother by camel to the Persian Gulf coast and then by boat to Bahrain. In Bahrain, at the dawn of the age of oil in that part of the Persian Gulf, Suliman attended the American school, where he learned English, and then the Al-Khalifa and Al-Jafariya schools. He proved to be an exceptional student with a prodigious memory and an uncanny ability to see things not just as they were but as they could be. After leaving school in 1936, he went to work for The Bahrain Petroleum Company. A year later, he returned to Saudi Arabia to take a job with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, the forerunner of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco). By 1947, Suliman had risen from transportation dispatcher to storehouse supervisor to a position in Government Relations. During King Abdul Aziz Al Saud's historic visit to Dhahran in April of that year, Suliman served as a company translator.
In the wake of World War II, the oil industry was expanding rapidly. Sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Suliman set out on his own in the summer of 1947. With a personal loan secured on his home, he established General Contracting Company (GCC).
GCC's first customer was Bechtel, which was under contract to Aramco to manage the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line (Tapline), a mammoth project designed to link the oil wells in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province to a terminal in Lebanon on the Mediterranean Sea. GCC handled transportation and related services for the historic project.
Buoyed by GCC's success and with his entrepreneurial instincts and drive now in high gear, Suliman undertook a series of trailblazing projects in the 1950s. He played a key role in developing Saudi Arabia's earliest electrical power companies, founding the country's first public utility, the National Gas Company.
In 1954, he launched General Trading Company (GTC), the Group's food and consumer products distribution business. Also in 1954, Suliman was instrumental in introducing commercial insurance to Saudi Arabia, founding Arab Commercial Enterprises (ACE), which went on to become the largest insurance and reinsurance broker in the Middle East.
In the 1960s, Suliman turned to international equity investing, an activity which would eventually establish the Group as an influential participant in global capital markets.
Meanwhile, Suliman was also developing business alliances, pioneering in Saudi Arabia the concept of strategic partnerships and strengthening his relationship to Bechtel. Moreover, through GTC and GCC he acquired exclusive distributorships for Kimberly-Clark, General Foods, Pillsbury, Hunt Wesson, Cummins Engine, Kenworth and Atlas Copco. In 1969, the Group obtained a license from Kimberly-Clark to construct the first paper tissue converting plant in Saudi Arabia. The same year, GTC established one of the first cold storage and meat processing plants in the Kingdom, and the Group played a leading role with other Saudi and foreign investors to establish a large factory for manufacturing plastic pipe and fittings. Other joint manufacturing ventures with major multinationals followed.
Beginning in the late 1980s, the Group embarked on a series of new activities in Saudi Arabia, focusing on light manufacturing and franchising, reaching beyond the Kingdom to other Persian Gulf countries and the greater Middle East. At the same time, it consolidated and strengthened existing operations, a process that continues to this day.
He is survived by his son Khaled Olayan, his three daughters, Hayat Olayan, Hutham Olayan, Lubna Olayan, and his wife Mary.

March 27, 2017News__detailsRobert Leary to Join Olayan Group as Global CEOThe Olayan Group has named a new chief executive officer to head its global operations.  He is Robert G. Leary, a former top executive at TIAA and its subsidiary, Nuveen.
Mr. Leary’s immediate past position was CEO of Nuveen, a U.S.-based investment management firm that was acquired in 2014 by TIAA-CREF (Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association – College Retirement Equities Fund), now known as TIAA.  Mr. Leary had joined TIAA-CREF in 2013 and was instrumental in the acquisition and invigoration of Nuveen as well as its integration with TIAA’s pre-existing asset management business.
Mr. Leary began his career as a lawyer for White & Case in New York and in 1989 opened that firm’s office in Saudi Arabia, where it still has an active presence.  He then moved into the financial services arena with J.P. Morgan & Co., with AIG Financial Products, and as CEO of ING Investment Management Americas and ING Insurance U.S.  Mr. Leary serves on the board of Intact Financial Corporation, a major insurer publicly listed in Canada.  He also serves on the board of the nonprofit AmeriCares, a global health and disaster relief organization.  Mr. Leary holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Union College and a law degree from Fordham University, both located in New York State.
Mr. Leary takes over from Aziz D. Syriani, a long-serving and highly esteemed senior executive of The Olayan Group.  Mr. Syriani joined the Group in 1976, became Group president in 1978, and assumed the CEO title in in 2002 following the passing of the founder, Suliman S. Olayan.  Mr. Syriani has chaired the Group’s Corporate Board since 2013 and will continue to do so.  He will also work closely with Mr. Leary to ensure a smooth leadership transition.
Speaking for the Corporate Board, Director Khaled Olayan said:
“After a concerted international search, we have found in Rob Leary a talented professional who appreciates our history, will fit in well with our culture, and has the necessary skills and experience to guide us forward.
“We also are profoundly fortunate that we continue to avail ourselves of Aziz Syriani’s invaluable experience, wisdom, generosity, and good humor.
“It is auspicious that this key leadership transition is occurring in 2017, the 70th Anniversary of The Olayan Group.”
The search for a CEO was led by Timothy P. Smucker, an independent director who chairs the Human Resources Committee of The Olayan Group’s Corporate Board.  In addition to Messrs. Olayan, Syriani, and Smucker, the other members of the board are Hutham S. Olayan, Lubna S. Olayan, and independent directors Erik Brenninkmeijer and John Jeffry Louis III.

ING Capital LLC Originates $570 Million Senior Secured Bridge Loan for Olayan America
Jun 2 16
ING Capital LLC originated a $570 million senior secured bridge loan for Olayan America, the US investment arm of The Olayan Group, to purchase 550 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The short-term loan is secured by a first mortgage on the property, an iconic skyscraper known most recently as the Sony Building. The 37-story building in the Plaza District of Manhattan has 852,830 square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The building features approximately 776,000 square feet of office space, prime retail frontage on Madison Avenue, and exhibition and museum space. The property is currently occupied by one restaurant tenant holding 5,000 square feet. It is effectively 100% vacant, providing Olayan and asset manager Chelsfield an opportunity to rebrand the building and create value by renovating and reconfiguring the existing space. Construction of the building was completed in 1984 as the global headquarters of AT&T. It has been sold on just two previous occasions to Sony Corporation in 2002 and in 2013 to the Chetrit Group, the immediate past owner.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student

Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"

"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
