Mma Capital Management, LLC Company Profile

   Municipal Mortgage & Equity (MuniMae) invests in tax-free municipal bonds issued by state and local governments. Those bonds are typically used to build multifamily housing, including units for low-income families, students, and the elderly. The disruption in world credit markets, coupled with a deterioration in the tax-exempt bond market hurt MuniMae. The commercial real estate market also tanked, driving down the values of the company's assets. The company was forced to drastically reduce the size of its business, cut its workforce by 80%, and sell off assets at a loss in order to stay afloat. MuniMae continues to look for ways to reduce debt and raise capital.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls.

Mma Capital Management, LLC Revenue and Financial Data

   Municipal Mortgage & Equity (MuniMae) invests in tax-free municipal bonds issued by state and local governments. Those bonds are typically used to build multifamily housing, including units for low-income families, students, and the elderly. The disruption in world credit markets, coupled with a deterioration in the tax-exempt bond market hurt MuniMae. The commercial real estate market also tanked, driving down the values of the company's assets. The company was forced to drastically reduce the size of its business, cut its workforce by 80%, and sell off assets at a loss in order to stay afloat. MuniMae continues to look for ways to reduce debt and raise capital.

MMA Energy Capital Closes Solar Construction Loan in Puerto Rico

BALTIMORE, June 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- MMA Capital Management, LLC (NASDAQ:   MMAC) ("MMA Capital Management" or the "Company"), a Delaware limited liability company, today announced that its subsidiary, MMA Energy Capital, LLC ("MMA Energy Capital"), has closed a construction loan with one of the largest renewable developers in the world to finance the construction of a solar power project to provide power to the subsidiary of a NASDAQ 100 company located in Puerto Rico.
"Solar continues to grow in Puerto Rico given the extremely high cost of power and the desire to move away from diesel generation.  While the Puerto Rico government has had some credit challenges, the private sector remains a robust market with limited credit risk for the right power buyers, and this is where we've focused our solar lending activities," Bob Hopper, Managing Director of MMA Energy Capital stated. 
Kevin Panzica, Vice President, MMA Energy Capital added, "Electricity costs in Puerto Rico exceed thirty cents a kilowatt hour for business customers and solar is increasingly becoming not only a mechanism for real cost savings but also a hedge against future cost escalations for private companies."
About MMA Energy Capital
MMA Energy Capital provides custom solutions around construction debt and development capital for renewable energy projects that enable its customers to effectively develop and build world class projects through access to efficiently placed capital.
