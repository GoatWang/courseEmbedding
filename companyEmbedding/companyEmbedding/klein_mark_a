History[edit]




A Calvin Klein store in Fairview Mall


The early years[edit]
In 1968, Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000.[5][6] The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of "youthful, understated coats and dresses" featured at the New York City store Bonwit Teller.[5]
In September 1969, Klein appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.[7]
1970s[edit]
By 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers, and lingerie to his women's collection.
In 1973, he received his first Coty American Fashion Critics' Award for his 74-piece womenswear collection - the youngest recipient at that time.[7] Klein won the award again in 1974 and 1975.[7] By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million (equivalent to $119 million in 2017), and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses, and sheets. Klein and Schwartz were making $4 million each. After the company signed licenses for cosmetics, jeans, and menswear, Klein's annual retail volume was estimated[by whom?] at $100 million (equivalent to $395 million in 2017). In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket. Klein's design assistant at the time, Jeffrey Banks, has claimed credit for the logo garments, stating that he had the logo from a press folder silkscreened onto the sleeve of a brown T-shirt as a present for Klein.[8] The gift was assumed by Schwartz to be part of the upcoming line, and similar logo shirts formed the uniform for the front-of-house staff at Klein's next catwalk show, leading to buyer demand.[8]
In the late 1970s, the company also made attempts to set up its own fragrance and cosmetics lines, but soon withdrew from the market with big financial losses. In the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. Calvin Klein's underwear business promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of the pop singer Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as "Calvins".
1980s–1985: Underwear[edit]
In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a "wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be" to one where "the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see".[9]
The stunning growth continued through the early eighties. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974 (equivalent to $116,551 in 2016), had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later (equivalent to $16.83 million in 2017). That year, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million (equivalent to $1383.15 million in 2017). Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries through licensing deals, namely Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. His annual income passed $12 million (equivalent to $27.66 million in 2017).
Financial problems increased pressure from all sides, disagreements with the licensee of the menswear line and its disappointing sales as well as an enormous employee turnover both within Calvin Klein and its licensing partners led to the first rumors that Calvin Klein Industries, as the company had been known by then, was up for sale. And indeed, in late 1987, it was said that the sale of the company to Triangle Industries, a container manufacturer, had only failed because of the crashing stock market.
Although the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the ck sportswear line. During his 1990-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs.[10] Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg,[10][11] they have been called "one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century."[10] Klein was named "America's Best Designer" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993, and it came as a surprise in 1999 when it was announced that CKI was again up for sale. Planning to expand its business, the company had been approached by two luxury goods companies, LVMH and Pinault Printemps Redoute, to join Calvin Klein, but nothing resulted. Other potentials like Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Italy's Holding di Partecipazioni proved to be similar disappointments because of CKI's steep price tag of supposedly $1 billion. After seven months and no potential buyer, Klein announced that his empire was not on the market anymore. The company would never manage to go public, which had supposedly been Klein's plan once.

2002–present: Acquisition by Phillips van Heusen[edit]
In mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH),[12] whose then CEO Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash, $30 million in stock as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million.[13] The sale also included an ongoing personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.
PVH outbid VF Corp., the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, which had also been interested in the jeans, underwear and swimwear business of CK that had been controlled by Warnaco Group, maker of Speedo swimwear in the US, since 1997. The deal with PVH did not include these businesses, and they remained with Warnaco. Unable to pay debts from acquisitions and licensing agreements and due to bad publicity by a later dismissed lawsuit with Calvin Klein over selling license products to retailers other than agreed upon with Calvin Klein, Warnaco had filed for chapter 11 protection in mid-2001 but eventually emerged from bankruptcy in February 2003.[14]
The transaction between Calvin Klein and PVH was financially supported by Apax Partners Inc., a New York private equity firm, which is said to have made a $250 million equity investment in PVH convertible preferred stock, as well as a $125 million, two-year secured note, all in exchange for seats on the board of PVH.[15]
CKI thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH. In the beginning, Klein himself, who was included as a person in the 15-year contract he had signed with PVH, remained creative head of the collections but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003 on and has since been more withdrawn from the business. Barry K. Schwartz was said to concentrate on his role as chairman of the New York Racing Association, a horse-racing club. The current President and COO of the CKI division within PVH are Tom Murry, who had filled this position already before the acquisition.
With the fall 2006 Collection runway presentations in New York City, CKI inaugurated an 8,600 sq ft (800 m2) showroom space that can seat up to 600 people on the ground floor of 205 West 39th Street, in Times Square South where Calvin Klein has been headquartered since 1978.
In a 2010 report, PVH, who manages the ready-to-wear activities, had estimated sales of €4.6 billion of Calvin Klein products.[3]
In Feb 2013 Warnaco Group was acquired by PVH which united Calvin Klein formal, underwear, jeans and sportswear lines.[16][17]

Fragrances[edit]
Calvin Klein has various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity. Until May 2005, their perfumes and the corresponding fragrance lines were maintained by Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company (CKCC), a Unilever company. Cosmetics giant Coty, Inc. of New York bought the fragrance licensing agreements from Unilever.
Advertising[edit]




Calvin Klein models


The early ads were shot by Bruce Weber and Richard Avedon. One of his male underwear models, Mark Wahlberg, went on to fame as hip hop star "Marky Mark", launching himself into the Hollywood scene to become a current actor. Another Hollywood star first appearing in Calvin Klein advertisements is Antonio Sabato Jr.. Calvin Klein employed Kate Moss at the start of her career in the early 1990s and in 2002 after allegations of cocaine use. Other models who have appeared in advertisements early in their careers are Natalia Vodianova, Scott King and Toni Garrn. Currently Calvin Klein uses Tyson Ballou and Lara Stone, and in the past has also used Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Patti Hansen, Tom Hintnaus, David Agbodji, Travis Fimmel, Doutzen Kroes, Mini Anden, Garrett Neff, Sean O'Pry, Edita Vilkeviciute, Jamie Dornan, Liu Wen, Edward Furlong and Vladimir Ivanov.[citation needed] Fit Models include Dale Noelle.[21] Actors such as Eva Mendes, Mehcad Brooks, Scarlett Johansson, Kellan Lutz, Andie MacDowell, Alexander Skarsgard, Zoe Saldana, Rita Ora, Rooney Mara and Diane Kruger have also been chosen to model for the brand.[citation needed] Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg starred in a series of adverts for the company.[22] Recently, singer Justin Bieber appeared in advertising for Calvin Klein's underwear range,[23] as did fashion model Kendall Jenner.
They also have experimented with emerging technologies. When advertising cKone perfume in 1999, they placed e-mail addresses in print advertisements, targeted at teenagers. When these teens mailed these addresses, they would be placed on a mailing list that sent them mails with vague details about the models' lives, with fake details meant to make them more relatable. These mails came at unpredictable intervals and were supposed to give readers the feeling that they had some connection with these characters. Though the mailing lists were discontinued in 2002, the campaign has inspired similar marketing tactics for movies and other retail products.
Branding[edit]
Like other fashion brands, Calvin Klein established a monogram: the "cK" emblem.[24]
Licensees[edit]
As of 2012, the top three licensees were:

Warnco - 40% of license royalties, which is "around $100 million"[3]
Coty - 12% of license royalties[3]
G-III Apparel Group - 14% of license royalties[3]

Internet[edit]
In 2004, the company bought the domain name CK.com. Calvin Klein is one of the few corporations worldwide to own a two letter domain name.[citation needed]
Designers[edit]
When Calvin Klein was acquired by PVH Corp. in 2003, Francisco Costa was appointed the Women’s Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women is Brazilian-born Francisco Costa who had already worked with Klein directly before the founder's departure from the company. Costa had taken over the job in 2003.[25]
Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had collaborated with Calvin Klein for six seasons before he became head designer Men’s Creative Director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line in spring 2004.[26]
Kevin Carrigan, an Englishman, was named the creative director of the ck Calvin Klein, and Calvin Klein (white label), Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear brands and their related licensed products. Carrigan had been with Calvin Klein since 1998.
In April 2016, it was announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli would be leaving the company.[26]
In August 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand, overseeing all aspects of design, global market and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons assumed the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the company’s ready to wear, bridge, sportswear, jeans, underwear and home lines. Pieter Mulier was also announced as Creative Director, reporting directly to Mr. Simons and responsible for executing his Mr. Simons creative and design vision for men’s and women’s ready to wear, bridge and better apparel and accessories. It was also announced that Kevin Carrigan would leave the company. Simons's first collections debuted for the Fall 2017 season.[27]
In December 2016, it was announced that Amy Mellen would leave the company. In January 2017, it was announced that Clémande Burgevin Blachman would assume the role of Vice President of Design for Calvin Klein Home.
Corporate[edit]
Stores[edit]

Calvin Klein Collection

In the late 1990s, the company opened elegant Calvin Klein Collection stores in Paris, Seoul, and Taipei and ultra high-end cK Calvin Klein stores in Hong Kong, Milan, and Kuwait City. As of today, there is only one Calvin Klein Collection store operated by CKI. It is located in New York City. Out of the two Calvin Klein Collection stores that existed in the US, the Dallas location in Highland Park Village which had been open for 20 years was closed in mid-2005. The only international location, in Paris, was closed by PVH in March 2006. The New York store, which serves as the company's flagship store at 654 Madison Ave., remains open still today. Partners maintain Calvin Klein Collection stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Dubai, and Qatar.

Calvin Klein (white label)

Specialty retail Calvin Klein stores, designed by New York architecture firm Lynch/Eisinger/Design have been opened at Lenox Square in Atlanta, Beverly Center in Los Angeles; now closed down, Cherry Creek Mall in Denver; now closed down, Natick Collection in Natick, MA; closing down on July 25, 2010, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Michigan; now closed down, Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa California. An additional eight stores also designed by Lynch/Eisinger/Design are set to open in 2008. There are also several Calvin Klein Outlet stores, mostly located within factory outlet malls in the US, that sell the white label sportswear and sometimes the Calvin Klein white label at reduced prices but do not carry the Collection lines. It has been reported that Calvin Klein will close all White Label locations within the next year.

Calvin Klein Jeans

Calvin Klein Jeans stores exist around the globe. Among many other countries in the UK, Germany, Greece, Russia, Brazil, México, Croatia, Egypt, Chile, Argentina, India, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. They also offer franchisee and opened in Cali last year.[citation needed]

Calvin Klein Underwear

Signature Calvin Klein Underwear boutiques can be found in Buenos Aires, Cardiff (as of April 2011), Mexico City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne, Hong Kong, London, Manchester, Manila, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Toronto and Hatfield, Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, B.C. (Metro Vancouver).

Department Stores

The major department stores in the US, including Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom, as well as many small independent stores carry the ck, white label and/or Jeans collections. Some high-end department stores, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus also carry the Calvin Klein Collection. Notable retailers in the UK offering Calvin Klein include stores such as John Lewis, Debenhams and KJ Beckett. In Australia, the dominant retailer is Myer. Calvin Klein products are also found online with particular internet focus on selling Calvin Klein underwear and fragrance.

Europe and Asia

In Europe, Calvin Klein is predominantly known for its underwear, accessories and perhaps the Collection business, rather than for the medium-priced sportswear lines which are available at select high-end retail stores. In Asia, there are also signature ck Calvin Klein stores that carry diffusion line, aka grey label including womenswear, menswear, accessories.
Controversies[edit]
In 1980, Richard Avedon photographed and directed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign that featured a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields. Some of those television commercials were banned, including the infamous ad where Brooke asks "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing!"
The 1995 adverts promoting Calvin Klein jeans received criticism for being "kiddie porn".[28][29][30][31]
In August 2012, Lululemon Athletica filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three Lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[32] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, Lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that would dismiss the suit.[33] According to a Lululemon press release, "Lululemon values its products and related IP rights and takes the necessary steps to protect its assets when we see attempts to mirror our products.”[34]
However, according to Chevalier's brand book Luxury Brand Management, Klein "is seldom involved in the design and the development of products bearing his name"[3] and "all activities are subcontracted to licensees."[3]
In 2014, Klein was criticized for the designation of Myla Dalbesio in its "Perfectly Fit" advertising campaign as a "plus-size" model, despite not using the term itself.[35]

History[edit]




A Calvin Klein store in Fairview Mall


The early years[edit]
In 1968, Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000.[5][6] The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of "youthful, understated coats and dresses" featured at the New York City store Bonwit Teller.[5]
In September 1969, Klein appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.[7]
1970s[edit]
By 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers, and lingerie to his women's collection.
In 1973, he received his first Coty American Fashion Critics' Award for his 74-piece womenswear collection - the youngest recipient at that time.[7] Klein won the award again in 1974 and 1975.[7] By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million (equivalent to $119 million in 2017), and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses, and sheets. Klein and Schwartz were making $4 million each. After the company signed licenses for cosmetics, jeans, and menswear, Klein's annual retail volume was estimated[by whom?] at $100 million (equivalent to $395 million in 2017). In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket. Klein's design assistant at the time, Jeffrey Banks, has claimed credit for the logo garments, stating that he had the logo from a press folder silkscreened onto the sleeve of a brown T-shirt as a present for Klein.[8] The gift was assumed by Schwartz to be part of the upcoming line, and similar logo shirts formed the uniform for the front-of-house staff at Klein's next catwalk show, leading to buyer demand.[8]
In the late 1970s, the company also made attempts to set up its own fragrance and cosmetics lines, but soon withdrew from the market with big financial losses. In the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. Calvin Klein's underwear business promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of the pop singer Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as "Calvins".
1980s–1985: Underwear[edit]
In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a "wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be" to one where "the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see".[9]
The stunning growth continued through the early eighties. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974 (equivalent to $116,551 in 2016), had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later (equivalent to $16.83 million in 2017). That year, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million (equivalent to $1383.15 million in 2017). Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries through licensing deals, namely Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. His annual income passed $12 million (equivalent to $27.66 million in 2017).
Financial problems increased pressure from all sides, disagreements with the licensee of the menswear line and its disappointing sales as well as an enormous employee turnover both within Calvin Klein and its licensing partners led to the first rumors that Calvin Klein Industries, as the company had been known by then, was up for sale. And indeed, in late 1987, it was said that the sale of the company to Triangle Industries, a container manufacturer, had only failed because of the crashing stock market.
Although the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the ck sportswear line. During his 1990-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs.[10] Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg,[10][11] they have been called "one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century."[10] Klein was named "America's Best Designer" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993, and it came as a surprise in 1999 when it was announced that CKI was again up for sale. Planning to expand its business, the company had been approached by two luxury goods companies, LVMH and Pinault Printemps Redoute, to join Calvin Klein, but nothing resulted. Other potentials like Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Italy's Holding di Partecipazioni proved to be similar disappointments because of CKI's steep price tag of supposedly $1 billion. After seven months and no potential buyer, Klein announced that his empire was not on the market anymore. The company would never manage to go public, which had supposedly been Klein's plan once.

2002–present: Acquisition by Phillips van Heusen[edit]
In mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH),[12] whose then CEO Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash, $30 million in stock as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million.[13] The sale also included an ongoing personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.
PVH outbid VF Corp., the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, which had also been interested in the jeans, underwear and swimwear business of CK that had been controlled by Warnaco Group, maker of Speedo swimwear in the US, since 1997. The deal with PVH did not include these businesses, and they remained with Warnaco. Unable to pay debts from acquisitions and licensing agreements and due to bad publicity by a later dismissed lawsuit with Calvin Klein over selling license products to retailers other than agreed upon with Calvin Klein, Warnaco had filed for chapter 11 protection in mid-2001 but eventually emerged from bankruptcy in February 2003.[14]
The transaction between Calvin Klein and PVH was financially supported by Apax Partners Inc., a New York private equity firm, which is said to have made a $250 million equity investment in PVH convertible preferred stock, as well as a $125 million, two-year secured note, all in exchange for seats on the board of PVH.[15]
CKI thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH. In the beginning, Klein himself, who was included as a person in the 15-year contract he had signed with PVH, remained creative head of the collections but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003 on and has since been more withdrawn from the business. Barry K. Schwartz was said to concentrate on his role as chairman of the New York Racing Association, a horse-racing club. The current President and COO of the CKI division within PVH are Tom Murry, who had filled this position already before the acquisition.
With the fall 2006 Collection runway presentations in New York City, CKI inaugurated an 8,600 sq ft (800 m2) showroom space that can seat up to 600 people on the ground floor of 205 West 39th Street, in Times Square South where Calvin Klein has been headquartered since 1978.
In a 2010 report, PVH, who manages the ready-to-wear activities, had estimated sales of €4.6 billion of Calvin Klein products.[3]
In Feb 2013 Warnaco Group was acquired by PVH which united Calvin Klein formal, underwear, jeans and sportswear lines.[16][17]
Products and marketing[edit]

Fragrances[edit]
Calvin Klein has various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity. Until May 2005, their perfumes and the corresponding fragrance lines were maintained by Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company (CKCC), a Unilever company. Cosmetics giant Coty, Inc. of New York bought the fragrance licensing agreements from Unilever.
Advertising[edit]




Calvin Klein models


The early ads were shot by Bruce Weber and Richard Avedon. One of his male underwear models, Mark Wahlberg, went on to fame as hip hop star "Marky Mark", launching himself into the Hollywood scene to become a current actor. Another Hollywood star first appearing in Calvin Klein advertisements is Antonio Sabato Jr.. Calvin Klein employed Kate Moss at the start of her career in the early 1990s and in 2002 after allegations of cocaine use. Other models who have appeared in advertisements early in their careers are Natalia Vodianova, Scott King and Toni Garrn. Currently Calvin Klein uses Tyson Ballou and Lara Stone, and in the past has also used Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Patti Hansen, Tom Hintnaus, David Agbodji, Travis Fimmel, Doutzen Kroes, Mini Anden, Garrett Neff, Sean O'Pry, Edita Vilkeviciute, Jamie Dornan, Liu Wen, Edward Furlong and Vladimir Ivanov.[citation needed] Fit Models include Dale Noelle.[21] Actors such as Eva Mendes, Mehcad Brooks, Scarlett Johansson, Kellan Lutz, Andie MacDowell, Alexander Skarsgard, Zoe Saldana, Rita Ora, Rooney Mara and Diane Kruger have also been chosen to model for the brand.[citation needed] Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg starred in a series of adverts for the company.[22] Recently, singer Justin Bieber appeared in advertising for Calvin Klein's underwear range,[23] as did fashion model Kendall Jenner.
They also have experimented with emerging technologies. When advertising cKone perfume in 1999, they placed e-mail addresses in print advertisements, targeted at teenagers. When these teens mailed these addresses, they would be placed on a mailing list that sent them mails with vague details about the models' lives, with fake details meant to make them more relatable. These mails came at unpredictable intervals and were supposed to give readers the feeling that they had some connection with these characters. Though the mailing lists were discontinued in 2002, the campaign has inspired similar marketing tactics for movies and other retail products.
Branding[edit]
Like other fashion brands, Calvin Klein established a monogram: the "cK" emblem.[24]
Licensees[edit]
As of 2012, the top three licensees were:

Warnco - 40% of license royalties, which is "around $100 million"[3]
Coty - 12% of license royalties[3]
G-III Apparel Group - 14% of license royalties[3]

Internet[edit]
In 2004, the company bought the domain name CK.com. Calvin Klein is one of the few corporations worldwide to own a two letter domain name.[citation needed]
Designers[edit]
When Calvin Klein was acquired by PVH Corp. in 2003, Francisco Costa was appointed the Women’s Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women is Brazilian-born Francisco Costa who had already worked with Klein directly before the founder's departure from the company. Costa had taken over the job in 2003.[25]
Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had collaborated with Calvin Klein for six seasons before he became head designer Men’s Creative Director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line in spring 2004.[26]
Kevin Carrigan, an Englishman, was named the creative director of the ck Calvin Klein, and Calvin Klein (white label), Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear brands and their related licensed products. Carrigan had been with Calvin Klein since 1998.
In April 2016, it was announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli would be leaving the company.[26]
In August 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand, overseeing all aspects of design, global market and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons assumed the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the company’s ready to wear, bridge, sportswear, jeans, underwear and home lines. Pieter Mulier was also announced as Creative Director, reporting directly to Mr. Simons and responsible for executing his Mr. Simons creative and design vision for men’s and women’s ready to wear, bridge and better apparel and accessories. It was also announced that Kevin Carrigan would leave the company. Simons's first collections debuted for the Fall 2017 season.[27]
In December 2016, it was announced that Amy Mellen would leave the company. In January 2017, it was announced that Clémande Burgevin Blachman would assume the role of Vice President of Design for Calvin Klein Home.
Corporate[edit]
Stores[edit]

Calvin Klein Collection

In the late 1990s, the company opened elegant Calvin Klein Collection stores in Paris, Seoul, and Taipei and ultra high-end cK Calvin Klein stores in Hong Kong, Milan, and Kuwait City. As of today, there is only one Calvin Klein Collection store operated by CKI. It is located in New York City. Out of the two Calvin Klein Collection stores that existed in the US, the Dallas location in Highland Park Village which had been open for 20 years was closed in mid-2005. The only international location, in Paris, was closed by PVH in March 2006. The New York store, which serves as the company's flagship store at 654 Madison Ave., remains open still today. Partners maintain Calvin Klein Collection stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Dubai, and Qatar.

Calvin Klein (white label)

Specialty retail Calvin Klein stores, designed by New York architecture firm Lynch/Eisinger/Design have been opened at Lenox Square in Atlanta, Beverly Center in Los Angeles; now closed down, Cherry Creek Mall in Denver; now closed down, Natick Collection in Natick, MA; closing down on July 25, 2010, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Michigan; now closed down, Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa California. An additional eight stores also designed by Lynch/Eisinger/Design are set to open in 2008. There are also several Calvin Klein Outlet stores, mostly located within factory outlet malls in the US, that sell the white label sportswear and sometimes the Calvin Klein white label at reduced prices but do not carry the Collection lines. It has been reported that Calvin Klein will close all White Label locations within the next year.

Calvin Klein Jeans

Calvin Klein Jeans stores exist around the globe. Among many other countries in the UK, Germany, Greece, Russia, Brazil, México, Croatia, Egypt, Chile, Argentina, India, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. They also offer franchisee and opened in Cali last year.[citation needed]

Calvin Klein Underwear

Signature Calvin Klein Underwear boutiques can be found in Buenos Aires, Cardiff (as of April 2011), Mexico City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne, Hong Kong, London, Manchester, Manila, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Toronto and Hatfield, Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, B.C. (Metro Vancouver).

Department Stores

The major department stores in the US, including Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom, as well as many small independent stores carry the ck, white label and/or Jeans collections. Some high-end department stores, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus also carry the Calvin Klein Collection. Notable retailers in the UK offering Calvin Klein include stores such as John Lewis, Debenhams and KJ Beckett. In Australia, the dominant retailer is Myer. Calvin Klein products are also found online with particular internet focus on selling Calvin Klein underwear and fragrance.

Europe and Asia

In Europe, Calvin Klein is predominantly known for its underwear, accessories and perhaps the Collection business, rather than for the medium-priced sportswear lines which are available at select high-end retail stores. In Asia, there are also signature ck Calvin Klein stores that carry diffusion line, aka grey label including womenswear, menswear, accessories.
Controversies[edit]
In 1980, Richard Avedon photographed and directed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign that featured a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields. Some of those television commercials were banned, including the infamous ad where Brooke asks "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing!"
The 1995 adverts promoting Calvin Klein jeans received criticism for being "kiddie porn".[28][29][30][31]
In August 2012, Lululemon Athletica filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three Lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[32] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, Lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that would dismiss the suit.[33] According to a Lululemon press release, "Lululemon values its products and related IP rights and takes the necessary steps to protect its assets when we see attempts to mirror our products.”[34]
However, according to Chevalier's brand book Luxury Brand Management, Klein "is seldom involved in the design and the development of products bearing his name"[3] and "all activities are subcontracted to licensees."[3]
In 2014, Klein was criticized for the designation of Myla Dalbesio in its "Perfectly Fit" advertising campaign as a "plus-size" model, despite not using the term itself.[35]

History[edit]




A Calvin Klein store in Fairview Mall


The early years[edit]
In 1968, Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000.[5][6] The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of "youthful, understated coats and dresses" featured at the New York City store Bonwit Teller.[5]
In September 1969, Klein appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.[7]
1970s[edit]
By 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers, and lingerie to his women's collection.
In 1973, he received his first Coty American Fashion Critics' Award for his 74-piece womenswear collection - the youngest recipient at that time.[7] Klein won the award again in 1974 and 1975.[7] By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million (equivalent to $119 million in 2017), and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses, and sheets. Klein and Schwartz were making $4 million each. After the company signed licenses for cosmetics, jeans, and menswear, Klein's annual retail volume was estimated[by whom?] at $100 million (equivalent to $395 million in 2017). In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket. Klein's design assistant at the time, Jeffrey Banks, has claimed credit for the logo garments, stating that he had the logo from a press folder silkscreened onto the sleeve of a brown T-shirt as a present for Klein.[8] The gift was assumed by Schwartz to be part of the upcoming line, and similar logo shirts formed the uniform for the front-of-house staff at Klein's next catwalk show, leading to buyer demand.[8]
In the late 1970s, the company also made attempts to set up its own fragrance and cosmetics lines, but soon withdrew from the market with big financial losses. In the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. Calvin Klein's underwear business promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of the pop singer Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as "Calvins".
1980s–1985: Underwear[edit]
In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a "wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be" to one where "the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see".[9]
The stunning growth continued through the early eighties. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974 (equivalent to $116,551 in 2016), had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later (equivalent to $16.83 million in 2017). That year, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million (equivalent to $1383.15 million in 2017). Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries through licensing deals, namely Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. His annual income passed $12 million (equivalent to $27.66 million in 2017).
Financial problems increased pressure from all sides, disagreements with the licensee of the menswear line and its disappointing sales as well as an enormous employee turnover both within Calvin Klein and its licensing partners led to the first rumors that Calvin Klein Industries, as the company had been known by then, was up for sale. And indeed, in late 1987, it was said that the sale of the company to Triangle Industries, a container manufacturer, had only failed because of the crashing stock market.
Although the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the ck sportswear line. During his 1990-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs.[10] Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg,[10][11] they have been called "one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century."[10] Klein was named "America's Best Designer" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993, and it came as a surprise in 1999 when it was announced that CKI was again up for sale. Planning to expand its business, the company had been approached by two luxury goods companies, LVMH and Pinault Printemps Redoute, to join Calvin Klein, but nothing resulted. Other potentials like Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Italy's Holding di Partecipazioni proved to be similar disappointments because of CKI's steep price tag of supposedly $1 billion. After seven months and no potential buyer, Klein announced that his empire was not on the market anymore. The company would never manage to go public, which had supposedly been Klein's plan once.

2002–present: Acquisition by Phillips van Heusen[edit]
In mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH),[12] whose then CEO Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash, $30 million in stock as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million.[13] The sale also included an ongoing personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.
PVH outbid VF Corp., the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, which had also been interested in the jeans, underwear and swimwear business of CK that had been controlled by Warnaco Group, maker of Speedo swimwear in the US, since 1997. The deal with PVH did not include these businesses, and they remained with Warnaco. Unable to pay debts from acquisitions and licensing agreements and due to bad publicity by a later dismissed lawsuit with Calvin Klein over selling license products to retailers other than agreed upon with Calvin Klein, Warnaco had filed for chapter 11 protection in mid-2001 but eventually emerged from bankruptcy in February 2003.[14]
The transaction between Calvin Klein and PVH was financially supported by Apax Partners Inc., a New York private equity firm, which is said to have made a $250 million equity investment in PVH convertible preferred stock, as well as a $125 million, two-year secured note, all in exchange for seats on the board of PVH.[15]
CKI thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH. In the beginning, Klein himself, who was included as a person in the 15-year contract he had signed with PVH, remained creative head of the collections but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003 on and has since been more withdrawn from the business. Barry K. Schwartz was said to concentrate on his role as chairman of the New York Racing Association, a horse-racing club. The current President and COO of the CKI division within PVH are Tom Murry, who had filled this position already before the acquisition.
With the fall 2006 Collection runway presentations in New York City, CKI inaugurated an 8,600 sq ft (800 m2) showroom space that can seat up to 600 people on the ground floor of 205 West 39th Street, in Times Square South where Calvin Klein has been headquartered since 1978.
In a 2010 report, PVH, who manages the ready-to-wear activities, had estimated sales of €4.6 billion of Calvin Klein products.[3]
In Feb 2013 Warnaco Group was acquired by PVH which united Calvin Klein formal, underwear, jeans and sportswear lines.[16][17]
Products and marketing[edit]

Fragrances[edit]
Calvin Klein has various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity. Until May 2005, their perfumes and the corresponding fragrance lines were maintained by Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company (CKCC), a Unilever company. Cosmetics giant Coty, Inc. of New York bought the fragrance licensing agreements from Unilever.
Advertising[edit]




Calvin Klein models


The early ads were shot by Bruce Weber and Richard Avedon. One of his male underwear models, Mark Wahlberg, went on to fame as hip hop star "Marky Mark", launching himself into the Hollywood scene to become a current actor. Another Hollywood star first appearing in Calvin Klein advertisements is Antonio Sabato Jr.. Calvin Klein employed Kate Moss at the start of her career in the early 1990s and in 2002 after allegations of cocaine use. Other models who have appeared in advertisements early in their careers are Natalia Vodianova, Scott King and Toni Garrn. Currently Calvin Klein uses Tyson Ballou and Lara Stone, and in the past has also used Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Patti Hansen, Tom Hintnaus, David Agbodji, Travis Fimmel, Doutzen Kroes, Mini Anden, Garrett Neff, Sean O'Pry, Edita Vilkeviciute, Jamie Dornan, Liu Wen, Edward Furlong and Vladimir Ivanov.[citation needed] Fit Models include Dale Noelle.[21] Actors such as Eva Mendes, Mehcad Brooks, Scarlett Johansson, Kellan Lutz, Andie MacDowell, Alexander Skarsgard, Zoe Saldana, Rita Ora, Rooney Mara and Diane Kruger have also been chosen to model for the brand.[citation needed] Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg starred in a series of adverts for the company.[22] Recently, singer Justin Bieber appeared in advertising for Calvin Klein's underwear range,[23] as did fashion model Kendall Jenner.
They also have experimented with emerging technologies. When advertising cKone perfume in 1999, they placed e-mail addresses in print advertisements, targeted at teenagers. When these teens mailed these addresses, they would be placed on a mailing list that sent them mails with vague details about the models' lives, with fake details meant to make them more relatable. These mails came at unpredictable intervals and were supposed to give readers the feeling that they had some connection with these characters. Though the mailing lists were discontinued in 2002, the campaign has inspired similar marketing tactics for movies and other retail products.
Branding[edit]
Like other fashion brands, Calvin Klein established a monogram: the "cK" emblem.[24]
Licensees[edit]
As of 2012, the top three licensees were:

Warnco - 40% of license royalties, which is "around $100 million"[3]
Coty - 12% of license royalties[3]
G-III Apparel Group - 14% of license royalties[3]

Internet[edit]
In 2004, the company bought the domain name CK.com. Calvin Klein is one of the few corporations worldwide to own a two letter domain name.[citation needed]
Designers[edit]
When Calvin Klein was acquired by PVH Corp. in 2003, Francisco Costa was appointed the Women’s Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women is Brazilian-born Francisco Costa who had already worked with Klein directly before the founder's departure from the company. Costa had taken over the job in 2003.[25]
Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had collaborated with Calvin Klein for six seasons before he became head designer Men’s Creative Director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line in spring 2004.[26]
Kevin Carrigan, an Englishman, was named the creative director of the ck Calvin Klein, and Calvin Klein (white label), Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear brands and their related licensed products. Carrigan had been with Calvin Klein since 1998.
In April 2016, it was announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli would be leaving the company.[26]
In August 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand, overseeing all aspects of design, global market and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons assumed the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the company’s ready to wear, bridge, sportswear, jeans, underwear and home lines. Pieter Mulier was also announced as Creative Director, reporting directly to Mr. Simons and responsible for executing his Mr. Simons creative and design vision for men’s and women’s ready to wear, bridge and better apparel and accessories. It was also announced that Kevin Carrigan would leave the company. Simons's first collections debuted for the Fall 2017 season.[27]
In December 2016, it was announced that Amy Mellen would leave the company. In January 2017, it was announced that Clémande Burgevin Blachman would assume the role of Vice President of Design for Calvin Klein Home.
Corporate[edit]
Stores[edit]

Calvin Klein Collection

In the late 1990s, the company opened elegant Calvin Klein Collection stores in Paris, Seoul, and Taipei and ultra high-end cK Calvin Klein stores in Hong Kong, Milan, and Kuwait City. As of today, there is only one Calvin Klein Collection store operated by CKI. It is located in New York City. Out of the two Calvin Klein Collection stores that existed in the US, the Dallas location in Highland Park Village which had been open for 20 years was closed in mid-2005. The only international location, in Paris, was closed by PVH in March 2006. The New York store, which serves as the company's flagship store at 654 Madison Ave., remains open still today. Partners maintain Calvin Klein Collection stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Dubai, and Qatar.

Calvin Klein (white label)

Specialty retail Calvin Klein stores, designed by New York architecture firm Lynch/Eisinger/Design have been opened at Lenox Square in Atlanta, Beverly Center in Los Angeles; now closed down, Cherry Creek Mall in Denver; now closed down, Natick Collection in Natick, MA; closing down on July 25, 2010, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Michigan; now closed down, Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa California. An additional eight stores also designed by Lynch/Eisinger/Design are set to open in 2008. There are also several Calvin Klein Outlet stores, mostly located within factory outlet malls in the US, that sell the white label sportswear and sometimes the Calvin Klein white label at reduced prices but do not carry the Collection lines. It has been reported that Calvin Klein will close all White Label locations within the next year.

Calvin Klein Jeans

Calvin Klein Jeans stores exist around the globe. Among many other countries in the UK, Germany, Greece, Russia, Brazil, México, Croatia, Egypt, Chile, Argentina, India, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. They also offer franchisee and opened in Cali last year.[citation needed]

Calvin Klein Underwear

Signature Calvin Klein Underwear boutiques can be found in Buenos Aires, Cardiff (as of April 2011), Mexico City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne, Hong Kong, London, Manchester, Manila, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Toronto and Hatfield, Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, B.C. (Metro Vancouver).

Department Stores

The major department stores in the US, including Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom, as well as many small independent stores carry the ck, white label and/or Jeans collections. Some high-end department stores, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus also carry the Calvin Klein Collection. Notable retailers in the UK offering Calvin Klein include stores such as John Lewis, Debenhams and KJ Beckett. In Australia, the dominant retailer is Myer. Calvin Klein products are also found online with particular internet focus on selling Calvin Klein underwear and fragrance.

Europe and Asia

In Europe, Calvin Klein is predominantly known for its underwear, accessories and perhaps the Collection business, rather than for the medium-priced sportswear lines which are available at select high-end retail stores. In Asia, there are also signature ck Calvin Klein stores that carry diffusion line, aka grey label including womenswear, menswear, accessories.
Controversies[edit]
In 1980, Richard Avedon photographed and directed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign that featured a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields. Some of those television commercials were banned, including the infamous ad where Brooke asks "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing!"
The 1995 adverts promoting Calvin Klein jeans received criticism for being "kiddie porn".[28][29][30][31]
In August 2012, Lululemon Athletica filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three Lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[32] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, Lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that would dismiss the suit.[33] According to a Lululemon press release, "Lululemon values its products and related IP rights and takes the necessary steps to protect its assets when we see attempts to mirror our products.”[34]
However, according to Chevalier's brand book Luxury Brand Management, Klein "is seldom involved in the design and the development of products bearing his name"[3] and "all activities are subcontracted to licensees."[3]
In 2014, Klein was criticized for the designation of Myla Dalbesio in its "Perfectly Fit" advertising campaign as a "plus-size" model, despite not using the term itself.[35]

History[edit]




A Calvin Klein store in Fairview Mall


The early years[edit]
In 1968, Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000.[5][6] The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of "youthful, understated coats and dresses" featured at the New York City store Bonwit Teller.[5]
In September 1969, Klein appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.[7]
1970s[edit]
By 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers, and lingerie to his women's collection.
In 1973, he received his first Coty American Fashion Critics' Award for his 74-piece womenswear collection - the youngest recipient at that time.[7] Klein won the award again in 1974 and 1975.[7] By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million (equivalent to $119 million in 2017), and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses, and sheets. Klein and Schwartz were making $4 million each. After the company signed licenses for cosmetics, jeans, and menswear, Klein's annual retail volume was estimated[by whom?] at $100 million (equivalent to $395 million in 2017). In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket. Klein's design assistant at the time, Jeffrey Banks, has claimed credit for the logo garments, stating that he had the logo from a press folder silkscreened onto the sleeve of a brown T-shirt as a present for Klein.[8] The gift was assumed by Schwartz to be part of the upcoming line, and similar logo shirts formed the uniform for the front-of-house staff at Klein's next catwalk show, leading to buyer demand.[8]
In the late 1970s, the company also made attempts to set up its own fragrance and cosmetics lines, but soon withdrew from the market with big financial losses. In the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. Calvin Klein's underwear business promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of the pop singer Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as "Calvins".
1980s–1985: Underwear[edit]
In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a "wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be" to one where "the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see".[9]
The stunning growth continued through the early eighties. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974 (equivalent to $116,551 in 2016), had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later (equivalent to $16.83 million in 2017). That year, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million (equivalent to $1383.15 million in 2017). Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries through licensing deals, namely Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. His annual income passed $12 million (equivalent to $27.66 million in 2017).
Financial problems increased pressure from all sides, disagreements with the licensee of the menswear line and its disappointing sales as well as an enormous employee turnover both within Calvin Klein and its licensing partners led to the first rumors that Calvin Klein Industries, as the company had been known by then, was up for sale. And indeed, in late 1987, it was said that the sale of the company to Triangle Industries, a container manufacturer, had only failed because of the crashing stock market.
Although the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the ck sportswear line. During his 1990-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs.[10] Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg,[10][11] they have been called "one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century."[10] Klein was named "America's Best Designer" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993, and it came as a surprise in 1999 when it was announced that CKI was again up for sale. Planning to expand its business, the company had been approached by two luxury goods companies, LVMH and Pinault Printemps Redoute, to join Calvin Klein, but nothing resulted. Other potentials like Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Italy's Holding di Partecipazioni proved to be similar disappointments because of CKI's steep price tag of supposedly $1 billion. After seven months and no potential buyer, Klein announced that his empire was not on the market anymore. The company would never manage to go public, which had supposedly been Klein's plan once.

2002–present: Acquisition by Phillips van Heusen[edit]
In mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH),[12] whose then CEO Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash, $30 million in stock as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million.[13] The sale also included an ongoing personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.
PVH outbid VF Corp., the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, which had also been interested in the jeans, underwear and swimwear business of CK that had been controlled by Warnaco Group, maker of Speedo swimwear in the US, since 1997. The deal with PVH did not include these businesses, and they remained with Warnaco. Unable to pay debts from acquisitions and licensing agreements and due to bad publicity by a later dismissed lawsuit with Calvin Klein over selling license products to retailers other than agreed upon with Calvin Klein, Warnaco had filed for chapter 11 protection in mid-2001 but eventually emerged from bankruptcy in February 2003.[14]
The transaction between Calvin Klein and PVH was financially supported by Apax Partners Inc., a New York private equity firm, which is said to have made a $250 million equity investment in PVH convertible preferred stock, as well as a $125 million, two-year secured note, all in exchange for seats on the board of PVH.[15]
CKI thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH. In the beginning, Klein himself, who was included as a person in the 15-year contract he had signed with PVH, remained creative head of the collections but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003 on and has since been more withdrawn from the business. Barry K. Schwartz was said to concentrate on his role as chairman of the New York Racing Association, a horse-racing club. The current President and COO of the CKI division within PVH are Tom Murry, who had filled this position already before the acquisition.
With the fall 2006 Collection runway presentations in New York City, CKI inaugurated an 8,600 sq ft (800 m2) showroom space that can seat up to 600 people on the ground floor of 205 West 39th Street, in Times Square South where Calvin Klein has been headquartered since 1978.
In a 2010 report, PVH, who manages the ready-to-wear activities, had estimated sales of €4.6 billion of Calvin Klein products.[3]
In Feb 2013 Warnaco Group was acquired by PVH which united Calvin Klein formal, underwear, jeans and sportswear lines.[16][17]
Products and marketing[edit]

Fragrances[edit]
Calvin Klein has various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity. Until May 2005, their perfumes and the corresponding fragrance lines were maintained by Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company (CKCC), a Unilever company. Cosmetics giant Coty, Inc. of New York bought the fragrance licensing agreements from Unilever.
Advertising[edit]




Calvin Klein models


The early ads were shot by Bruce Weber and Richard Avedon. One of his male underwear models, Mark Wahlberg, went on to fame as hip hop star "Marky Mark", launching himself into the Hollywood scene to become a current actor. Another Hollywood star first appearing in Calvin Klein advertisements is Antonio Sabato Jr.. Calvin Klein employed Kate Moss at the start of her career in the early 1990s and in 2002 after allegations of cocaine use. Other models who have appeared in advertisements early in their careers are Natalia Vodianova, Scott King and Toni Garrn. Currently Calvin Klein uses Tyson Ballou and Lara Stone, and in the past has also used Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Patti Hansen, Tom Hintnaus, David Agbodji, Travis Fimmel, Doutzen Kroes, Mini Anden, Garrett Neff, Sean O'Pry, Edita Vilkeviciute, Jamie Dornan, Liu Wen, Edward Furlong and Vladimir Ivanov.[citation needed] Fit Models include Dale Noelle.[21] Actors such as Eva Mendes, Mehcad Brooks, Scarlett Johansson, Kellan Lutz, Andie MacDowell, Alexander Skarsgard, Zoe Saldana, Rita Ora, Rooney Mara and Diane Kruger have also been chosen to model for the brand.[citation needed] Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg starred in a series of adverts for the company.[22] Recently, singer Justin Bieber appeared in advertising for Calvin Klein's underwear range,[23] as did fashion model Kendall Jenner.
They also have experimented with emerging technologies. When advertising cKone perfume in 1999, they placed e-mail addresses in print advertisements, targeted at teenagers. When these teens mailed these addresses, they would be placed on a mailing list that sent them mails with vague details about the models' lives, with fake details meant to make them more relatable. These mails came at unpredictable intervals and were supposed to give readers the feeling that they had some connection with these characters. Though the mailing lists were discontinued in 2002, the campaign has inspired similar marketing tactics for movies and other retail products.
Branding[edit]
Like other fashion brands, Calvin Klein established a monogram: the "cK" emblem.[24]
Licensees[edit]
As of 2012, the top three licensees were:

Warnco - 40% of license royalties, which is "around $100 million"[3]
Coty - 12% of license royalties[3]
G-III Apparel Group - 14% of license royalties[3]

Internet[edit]
In 2004, the company bought the domain name CK.com. Calvin Klein is one of the few corporations worldwide to own a two letter domain name.[citation needed]
Designers[edit]
When Calvin Klein was acquired by PVH Corp. in 2003, Francisco Costa was appointed the Women’s Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women is Brazilian-born Francisco Costa who had already worked with Klein directly before the founder's departure from the company. Costa had taken over the job in 2003.[25]
Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had collaborated with Calvin Klein for six seasons before he became head designer Men’s Creative Director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line in spring 2004.[26]
Kevin Carrigan, an Englishman, was named the creative director of the ck Calvin Klein, and Calvin Klein (white label), Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear brands and their related licensed products. Carrigan had been with Calvin Klein since 1998.
In April 2016, it was announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli would be leaving the company.[26]
In August 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand, overseeing all aspects of design, global market and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons assumed the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the company’s ready to wear, bridge, sportswear, jeans, underwear and home lines. Pieter Mulier was also announced as Creative Director, reporting directly to Mr. Simons and responsible for executing his Mr. Simons creative and design vision for men’s and women’s ready to wear, bridge and better apparel and accessories. It was also announced that Kevin Carrigan would leave the company. Simons's first collections debuted for the Fall 2017 season.[27]
In December 2016, it was announced that Amy Mellen would leave the company. In January 2017, it was announced that Clémande Burgevin Blachman would assume the role of Vice President of Design for Calvin Klein Home.
Corporate[edit]
Stores[edit]

Calvin Klein Collection

In the late 1990s, the company opened elegant Calvin Klein Collection stores in Paris, Seoul, and Taipei and ultra high-end cK Calvin Klein stores in Hong Kong, Milan, and Kuwait City. As of today, there is only one Calvin Klein Collection store operated by CKI. It is located in New York City. Out of the two Calvin Klein Collection stores that existed in the US, the Dallas location in Highland Park Village which had been open for 20 years was closed in mid-2005. The only international location, in Paris, was closed by PVH in March 2006. The New York store, which serves as the company's flagship store at 654 Madison Ave., remains open still today. Partners maintain Calvin Klein Collection stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Dubai, and Qatar.

Calvin Klein (white label)

Specialty retail Calvin Klein stores, designed by New York architecture firm Lynch/Eisinger/Design have been opened at Lenox Square in Atlanta, Beverly Center in Los Angeles; now closed down, Cherry Creek Mall in Denver; now closed down, Natick Collection in Natick, MA; closing down on July 25, 2010, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Michigan; now closed down, Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa California. An additional eight stores also designed by Lynch/Eisinger/Design are set to open in 2008. There are also several Calvin Klein Outlet stores, mostly located within factory outlet malls in the US, that sell the white label sportswear and sometimes the Calvin Klein white label at reduced prices but do not carry the Collection lines. It has been reported that Calvin Klein will close all White Label locations within the next year.

Calvin Klein Jeans

Calvin Klein Jeans stores exist around the globe. Among many other countries in the UK, Germany, Greece, Russia, Brazil, México, Croatia, Egypt, Chile, Argentina, India, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. They also offer franchisee and opened in Cali last year.[citation needed]

Calvin Klein Underwear

Signature Calvin Klein Underwear boutiques can be found in Buenos Aires, Cardiff (as of April 2011), Mexico City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne, Hong Kong, London, Manchester, Manila, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Toronto and Hatfield, Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, B.C. (Metro Vancouver).

Department Stores

The major department stores in the US, including Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom, as well as many small independent stores carry the ck, white label and/or Jeans collections. Some high-end department stores, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus also carry the Calvin Klein Collection. Notable retailers in the UK offering Calvin Klein include stores such as John Lewis, Debenhams and KJ Beckett. In Australia, the dominant retailer is Myer. Calvin Klein products are also found online with particular internet focus on selling Calvin Klein underwear and fragrance.

Europe and Asia

In Europe, Calvin Klein is predominantly known for its underwear, accessories and perhaps the Collection business, rather than for the medium-priced sportswear lines which are available at select high-end retail stores. In Asia, there are also signature ck Calvin Klein stores that carry diffusion line, aka grey label including womenswear, menswear, accessories.
Controversies[edit]
In 1980, Richard Avedon photographed and directed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign that featured a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields. Some of those television commercials were banned, including the infamous ad where Brooke asks "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing!"
The 1995 adverts promoting Calvin Klein jeans received criticism for being "kiddie porn".[28][29][30][31]
In August 2012, Lululemon Athletica filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three Lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[32] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, Lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that would dismiss the suit.[33] According to a Lululemon press release, "Lululemon values its products and related IP rights and takes the necessary steps to protect its assets when we see attempts to mirror our products.”[34]
However, according to Chevalier's brand book Luxury Brand Management, Klein "is seldom involved in the design and the development of products bearing his name"[3] and "all activities are subcontracted to licensees."[3]
In 2014, Klein was criticized for the designation of Myla Dalbesio in its "Perfectly Fit" advertising campaign as a "plus-size" model, despite not using the term itself.[35]

History[edit]




A Calvin Klein store in Fairview Mall


The early years[edit]
In 1968, Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000.[5][6] The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of "youthful, understated coats and dresses" featured at the New York City store Bonwit Teller.[5]
In September 1969, Klein appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.[7]
1970s[edit]
By 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers, and lingerie to his women's collection.
In 1973, he received his first Coty American Fashion Critics' Award for his 74-piece womenswear collection - the youngest recipient at that time.[7] Klein won the award again in 1974 and 1975.[7] By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million (equivalent to $119 million in 2017), and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses, and sheets. Klein and Schwartz were making $4 million each. After the company signed licenses for cosmetics, jeans, and menswear, Klein's annual retail volume was estimated[by whom?] at $100 million (equivalent to $395 million in 2017). In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket. Klein's design assistant at the time, Jeffrey Banks, has claimed credit for the logo garments, stating that he had the logo from a press folder silkscreened onto the sleeve of a brown T-shirt as a present for Klein.[8] The gift was assumed by Schwartz to be part of the upcoming line, and similar logo shirts formed the uniform for the front-of-house staff at Klein's next catwalk show, leading to buyer demand.[8]
In the late 1970s, the company also made attempts to set up its own fragrance and cosmetics lines, but soon withdrew from the market with big financial losses. In the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. Calvin Klein's underwear business promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of the pop singer Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as "Calvins".
1980s–1985: Underwear[edit]
In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a "wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be" to one where "the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see".[9]
The stunning growth continued through the early eighties. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974 (equivalent to $116,551 in 2016), had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later (equivalent to $16.83 million in 2017). That year, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million (equivalent to $1383.15 million in 2017). Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries through licensing deals, namely Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. His annual income passed $12 million (equivalent to $27.66 million in 2017).
Financial problems increased pressure from all sides, disagreements with the licensee of the menswear line and its disappointing sales as well as an enormous employee turnover both within Calvin Klein and its licensing partners led to the first rumors that Calvin Klein Industries, as the company had been known by then, was up for sale. And indeed, in late 1987, it was said that the sale of the company to Triangle Industries, a container manufacturer, had only failed because of the crashing stock market.
Although the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the ck sportswear line. During his 1990-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs.[10] Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg,[10][11] they have been called "one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century."[10] Klein was named "America's Best Designer" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993, and it came as a surprise in 1999 when it was announced that CKI was again up for sale. Planning to expand its business, the company had been approached by two luxury goods companies, LVMH and Pinault Printemps Redoute, to join Calvin Klein, but nothing resulted. Other potentials like Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Italy's Holding di Partecipazioni proved to be similar disappointments because of CKI's steep price tag of supposedly $1 billion. After seven months and no potential buyer, Klein announced that his empire was not on the market anymore. The company would never manage to go public, which had supposedly been Klein's plan once.

2002–present: Acquisition by Phillips van Heusen[edit]
In mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH),[12] whose then CEO Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash, $30 million in stock as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million.[13] The sale also included an ongoing personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.
PVH outbid VF Corp., the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, which had also been interested in the jeans, underwear and swimwear business of CK that had been controlled by Warnaco Group, maker of Speedo swimwear in the US, since 1997. The deal with PVH did not include these businesses, and they remained with Warnaco. Unable to pay debts from acquisitions and licensing agreements and due to bad publicity by a later dismissed lawsuit with Calvin Klein over selling license products to retailers other than agreed upon with Calvin Klein, Warnaco had filed for chapter 11 protection in mid-2001 but eventually emerged from bankruptcy in February 2003.[14]
The transaction between Calvin Klein and PVH was financially supported by Apax Partners Inc., a New York private equity firm, which is said to have made a $250 million equity investment in PVH convertible preferred stock, as well as a $125 million, two-year secured note, all in exchange for seats on the board of PVH.[15]
CKI thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH. In the beginning, Klein himself, who was included as a person in the 15-year contract he had signed with PVH, remained creative head of the collections but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003 on and has since been more withdrawn from the business. Barry K. Schwartz was said to concentrate on his role as chairman of the New York Racing Association, a horse-racing club. The current President and COO of the CKI division within PVH are Tom Murry, who had filled this position already before the acquisition.
With the fall 2006 Collection runway presentations in New York City, CKI inaugurated an 8,600 sq ft (800 m2) showroom space that can seat up to 600 people on the ground floor of 205 West 39th Street, in Times Square South where Calvin Klein has been headquartered since 1978.
In a 2010 report, PVH, who manages the ready-to-wear activities, had estimated sales of €4.6 billion of Calvin Klein products.[3]
In Feb 2013 Warnaco Group was acquired by PVH which united Calvin Klein formal, underwear, jeans and sportswear lines.[16][17]
Products and marketing[edit]

Fragrances[edit]
Calvin Klein has various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity. Until May 2005, their perfumes and the corresponding fragrance lines were maintained by Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company (CKCC), a Unilever company. Cosmetics giant Coty, Inc. of New York bought the fragrance licensing agreements from Unilever.
Advertising[edit]




Calvin Klein models


The early ads were shot by Bruce Weber and Richard Avedon. One of his male underwear models, Mark Wahlberg, went on to fame as hip hop star "Marky Mark", launching himself into the Hollywood scene to become a current actor. Another Hollywood star first appearing in Calvin Klein advertisements is Antonio Sabato Jr.. Calvin Klein employed Kate Moss at the start of her career in the early 1990s and in 2002 after allegations of cocaine use. Other models who have appeared in advertisements early in their careers are Natalia Vodianova, Scott King and Toni Garrn. Currently Calvin Klein uses Tyson Ballou and Lara Stone, and in the past has also used Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Patti Hansen, Tom Hintnaus, David Agbodji, Travis Fimmel, Doutzen Kroes, Mini Anden, Garrett Neff, Sean O'Pry, Edita Vilkeviciute, Jamie Dornan, Liu Wen, Edward Furlong and Vladimir Ivanov.[citation needed] Fit Models include Dale Noelle.[21] Actors such as Eva Mendes, Mehcad Brooks, Scarlett Johansson, Kellan Lutz, Andie MacDowell, Alexander Skarsgard, Zoe Saldana, Rita Ora, Rooney Mara and Diane Kruger have also been chosen to model for the brand.[citation needed] Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg starred in a series of adverts for the company.[22] Recently, singer Justin Bieber appeared in advertising for Calvin Klein's underwear range,[23] as did fashion model Kendall Jenner.
They also have experimented with emerging technologies. When advertising cKone perfume in 1999, they placed e-mail addresses in print advertisements, targeted at teenagers. When these teens mailed these addresses, they would be placed on a mailing list that sent them mails with vague details about the models' lives, with fake details meant to make them more relatable. These mails came at unpredictable intervals and were supposed to give readers the feeling that they had some connection with these characters. Though the mailing lists were discontinued in 2002, the campaign has inspired similar marketing tactics for movies and other retail products.
Branding[edit]
Like other fashion brands, Calvin Klein established a monogram: the "cK" emblem.[24]
Licensees[edit]
As of 2012, the top three licensees were:

Warnco - 40% of license royalties, which is "around $100 million"[3]
Coty - 12% of license royalties[3]
G-III Apparel Group - 14% of license royalties[3]

Internet[edit]
In 2004, the company bought the domain name CK.com. Calvin Klein is one of the few corporations worldwide to own a two letter domain name.[citation needed]
Designers[edit]
When Calvin Klein was acquired by PVH Corp. in 2003, Francisco Costa was appointed the Women’s Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women is Brazilian-born Francisco Costa who had already worked with Klein directly before the founder's departure from the company. Costa had taken over the job in 2003.[25]
Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had collaborated with Calvin Klein for six seasons before he became head designer Men’s Creative Director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line in spring 2004.[26]
Kevin Carrigan, an Englishman, was named the creative director of the ck Calvin Klein, and Calvin Klein (white label), Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear brands and their related licensed products. Carrigan had been with Calvin Klein since 1998.
In April 2016, it was announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli would be leaving the company.[26]
In August 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand, overseeing all aspects of design, global market and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons assumed the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the company’s ready to wear, bridge, sportswear, jeans, underwear and home lines. Pieter Mulier was also announced as Creative Director, reporting directly to Mr. Simons and responsible for executing his Mr. Simons creative and design vision for men’s and women’s ready to wear, bridge and better apparel and accessories. It was also announced that Kevin Carrigan would leave the company. Simons's first collections debuted for the Fall 2017 season.[27]
In December 2016, it was announced that Amy Mellen would leave the company. In January 2017, it was announced that Clémande Burgevin Blachman would assume the role of Vice President of Design for Calvin Klein Home.
Corporate[edit]
Stores[edit]

Calvin Klein Collection

In the late 1990s, the company opened elegant Calvin Klein Collection stores in Paris, Seoul, and Taipei and ultra high-end cK Calvin Klein stores in Hong Kong, Milan, and Kuwait City. As of today, there is only one Calvin Klein Collection store operated by CKI. It is located in New York City. Out of the two Calvin Klein Collection stores that existed in the US, the Dallas location in Highland Park Village which had been open for 20 years was closed in mid-2005. The only international location, in Paris, was closed by PVH in March 2006. The New York store, which serves as the company's flagship store at 654 Madison Ave., remains open still today. Partners maintain Calvin Klein Collection stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Dubai, and Qatar.

Calvin Klein (white label)

Specialty retail Calvin Klein stores, designed by New York architecture firm Lynch/Eisinger/Design have been opened at Lenox Square in Atlanta, Beverly Center in Los Angeles; now closed down, Cherry Creek Mall in Denver; now closed down, Natick Collection in Natick, MA; closing down on July 25, 2010, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Michigan; now closed down, Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa California. An additional eight stores also designed by Lynch/Eisinger/Design are set to open in 2008. There are also several Calvin Klein Outlet stores, mostly located within factory outlet malls in the US, that sell the white label sportswear and sometimes the Calvin Klein white label at reduced prices but do not carry the Collection lines. It has been reported that Calvin Klein will close all White Label locations within the next year.

Calvin Klein Jeans

Calvin Klein Jeans stores exist around the globe. Among many other countries in the UK, Germany, Greece, Russia, Brazil, México, Croatia, Egypt, Chile, Argentina, India, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. They also offer franchisee and opened in Cali last year.[citation needed]

Calvin Klein Underwear

Signature Calvin Klein Underwear boutiques can be found in Buenos Aires, Cardiff (as of April 2011), Mexico City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne, Hong Kong, London, Manchester, Manila, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Toronto and Hatfield, Metropolis at Metrotown in Burnaby, B.C. (Metro Vancouver).

Department Stores

The major department stores in the US, including Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Nordstrom, as well as many small independent stores carry the ck, white label and/or Jeans collections. Some high-end department stores, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus also carry the Calvin Klein Collection. Notable retailers in the UK offering Calvin Klein include stores such as John Lewis, Debenhams and KJ Beckett. In Australia, the dominant retailer is Myer. Calvin Klein products are also found online with particular internet focus on selling Calvin Klein underwear and fragrance.

Europe and Asia

In Europe, Calvin Klein is predominantly known for its underwear, accessories and perhaps the Collection business, rather than for the medium-priced sportswear lines which are available at select high-end retail stores. In Asia, there are also signature ck Calvin Klein stores that carry diffusion line, aka grey label including womenswear, menswear, accessories.
Controversies[edit]
In 1980, Richard Avedon photographed and directed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign that featured a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields. Some of those television commercials were banned, including the infamous ad where Brooke asks "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing!"
The 1995 adverts promoting Calvin Klein jeans received criticism for being "kiddie porn".[28][29][30][31]
In August 2012, Lululemon Athletica filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three Lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[32] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, Lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that would dismiss the suit.[33] According to a Lululemon press release, "Lululemon values its products and related IP rights and takes the necessary steps to protect its assets when we see attempts to mirror our products.”[34]
However, according to Chevalier's brand book Luxury Brand Management, Klein "is seldom involved in the design and the development of products bearing his name"[3] and "all activities are subcontracted to licensees."[3]
In 2014, Klein was criticized for the designation of Myla Dalbesio in its "Perfectly Fit" advertising campaign as a "plus-size" model, despite not using the term itself.[35]

Rewind: Before Bieber, There Was Marky Mark for Calvin Klein
A Look Back at the Iconic Underwear Campaign


	By  

Ann-Christine Diaz.
	

	
	
 Published on February 12, 2015. 







'Tis the season for spring fashion campaigns, and perhaps the most head-scratching idea we've seen in the space is this ad:





Although others would beg to differ, Justin Bieber reads like a big taint on the sophisticated, seductive and sometimes controversial legacy of Calvin Klein ads (at least in our book, because of his utter douchiness).
It's a clear homage to perhaps what's arguably one of the most iconic celebrity fashion marketing moves to date, the brand's 1992 men's underwear campaign featuring Mark Wahlberg, then known, of course, as Marky Mark.



		Mark Wahlberg for Calvin Klein 
 	

The print ads and accompanying spots were created by then Calvin Klein Senior VP Neil Kraft, now founder and CCO of Kraftworks, the company behind the recent plus-sized model ad for Swimsuitsforall running in this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
Whether you were a hater or a fan of the pseudo-rapper, it's hard to deny that with the campaign, something pretty powerful occurred at the intersection of celebrity and fashion.
The ads revealed a whole new dimension to Mr. Wahlbeg (beyond the six pack) -- and perhaps allowed you to forgive the fact that he associated himself with a posse called "The Funky Bunch." Looking back, they were a prescient sign of his superstardom to come. And although Calvin Klein was probably the name in men's underwear at the time, the campaign helped cement that idea in consumer consciousness.


Advertising Age Player

"We were repositioning Calvin's men's underwear line, which at the time was a relatively small business," Mr. Kraft said. "It wasn't like we were casting around for a celebrity, it was more like 'What do we do for the new campaign for mens' underwear? Right at the same time, Mark was on the cover of Rolling Stone showing his Calvin Klein underwear. Both Calvin and I saw it and thought, This is the guy we need."
At the time, CK had no connection to Wahlberg, but Mr. Kraft said Mr. Klein was good friends with producer David Geffen. "We approached [Wahlberg] not knowing what would happen, but thought he would be a great model, and eventually he agreed to do it."
The campaign was shot by the late Herb Ritts and featured solo shots and film of Mr. Wahlberg as well as others in which he's accompanied by Kate Moss.
Mr. Kraft said that the films, in which Mr. Wahlberg raps, grabs his crotch and raves about how his Calvins don't get "stretched out," were all unscripted. "He hadn't done any acting, so we had no idea whether he could act," Mr. Kraft said. "But he had a natural likability. I think it came through in the print and it came through in the TV."



		No retouching involved 
 	

Mr. Wahlberg ultimately attracted a broad audience. "It was a really nice combination -- he appealed to women, he appealed to gay men and he appealed to men who wanted to be him," said Mr. Kraft. "It all kind of worked together. And unlike Justin Bieber, he's incredibly naturally charming. And we didn't retouch him."
And you can only imagine what would have happened had Facebook or Twitter been around. "This was fifteen years before social media and cellphones, but when we had him up to do fittings, people got word of it and across the street, they were putting their phone numbers in their windows. To this day, I can't figure out how they knew he was in the neighborhood."
Mr. Kraft said that after the campaign, the men's underwear business grew "exponentially," and even the women's line subsequently saw a bump in sales. All with a media plan that was only "around a million," he said.
As for the difference between the two campaigns, "Marky Mark was universally liked, Justin isn't," Mr. Kraft said. "There is an argument where the more risk you take, the more attention you get. One of the things I remember Calvin saying to me years back was there's no such thing as bad publicity. But I do think there are bad associations. I think people wanted to be like Marky Mark. I don't think everyone wants to be like Justin Bieber."

										Beware of specious folks offering unsolicited affirmation of their "ethical" ways like Mark Klein (Dad), the self-described "multi-millionaire" owner of FMI products (FMI Fireplaces- 2701 South Harbor Blvd. Santa Ana, CA 92704) who gave me a one hour tour of his "one-hundred employee" factory bragging about his "dozens" of $35,000 machines and his recent origination of a large six-figure equity line of credit.Mark Klein used tangential braggadocio to guarantee me that his son Dane Klein, an "FMI supervisor" and Dane's best friend Anthony Derenzo were "good kids," that we should indeed rent an apartment to on Mark Klein's "word" right before Mark gave us the ONLY check we ever received from his family with lease agreement copy Mark's doppelgnger was to sign as guarantor but conveniently whited out. White Out, the perfidious Mark Kleins most trusted post agreement negotiation "trick." We had to EVICT Mark Klein's family in court for never paying one cent of rent or utilities, lying to us about being in a criminal street gang and for one of those "good kids" being charged with "street terrorism," in just one of at least four separate bloody hate crime incidents instigated by these insidious misanthropes over less than seventy five days! Incredibly enough, Mark Klein stated that we could "trust the Kleins" who clearly offer both immoral and financial support for their son and his gangbanging friends: "SC Boys" (San Clemente thugs) and "OCS" or Orange County Skinheads! Mark Klein admits that Dane Klein is "brain damaged" but by Dane's very own admission, Mark absurdly provides Dane with unregistered firearms he was "robbed" of likely by the very same hate groups with whom he gangbangs!When sheriff's deputies arrived to evict the Klein family, Mark Klein made personal appearance and kept Dane at good distance for fear of him being taken into custody. None of the Kleins or their hate mongering friends lifted one finger to clean or repair the holes in the walls and doors, nor did they pick up their trash, junk, and discarded furniture strewn about every room of the home. In addition, the Kleins actually STOLE my refrigerator and when confronted, Mark Klein reasoned with me that the Kleins would simply lie in concert defending against my litigation! These myopic interlopers are for sale to the lowest bidder! List of Damages When Dane Klein and/or his friends including Anthony DeRenzo attacked at least four Latinos including a very cordial young man living in our neighborhood who I've known for several years, Mark Klein was asked to pay for the victim's lip to be fixed so that the boy didn't have to bare permanent facial disfigurement as evidence of Kleins' hate: Mark Klein hung up the phone on the young man. Looks like someone needs a lesson in empathy! Ask yourself: Is there another fireplace manufacturer who doesn't underwrite violence and hate? Since the answer is obviously "yes," shop elsewhere and don't allow your money to support intolerance endorsing violence the Kleins create for recreation out of boredom with your resources.

Instead, John Caple Comvest on behalf of himself and Mark Klein Innovative Hearth Products' engineered a six figure legal battle complimented by hackneyed subterfuge from two thousand plus miles away: John Caple Comvest is bloated with ego just like the violent punks who beat our friend with brass knuckles.

AUTHOR: Montrief Victim #1000 -  () SUBMITTED: Tuesday, June 25, 2013 POSTED: Tuesday, June 25, 2013   I don't know Mark Klein, but I believe this report was written by a Huntington Beach scam artist by the name of Michael Montrief.  It contains his identification by use of his favorite words.   People should know that since the complaint was written by Michael Montrief it is undoubtedly not true, and on the contrary Mr. Klein probably went out of his way for Mr. Montrief.   Mr. Montrief is an individual who has made a large amount of money by scamming and ripping off unsuspecting victims over many years via gross Corvette scams as well as housing rentals.  He was finally caught and charges were filed against him somewhere between 2005 and 2007.  See news report http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=3637323 He has filed bankruptsy, and is running other scams by  renting out foreclosing real-estate.  By collecting rent in advance the bank cannot reposess the properties until the renter's time is up.   Mr. Montrief also hides two Toyota Prius's that are not paid for while waiting for the statute to run out and Toyota to give up looking for them.  To verify these statements please Google Michael Montrief Corvette Forum to see the rip off car complaints and  click this link to see renter complaints, http://www.donotrent.com/reviews/34031-silver-lantern-dana-point-ca  In 2008 Mr Montrief received a cease and refrain order for running real-estate scams, http://www.corp.ca.gov/ENF/pdf/2008/equityfund_dr.pdf and later had his Real Estate license revoked.  He is presently attempting to run a new real estate business called fsrefund which he claims will net him $100,000.00 monthly.  This is how he slandered another victim in this very website, Peter Liegl, http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/Peter-Liegl/Elkhart-Indiana-46517/Peter-Liegl-Mapletree-Transportation-Robbed-Our-Money-Time-Dignity-While-Smirking-Upon-908123  the following link is an ebay warning not to do business with him   http://www.ebay.com/gds/Beware-of-buying-Corvettes-from-US-CORVETTES/10000000001004400/g.html I am conveying this information because of my personal experience with Mr. Montrief in which he borrowed large amounts of money from me (a single mother), he never repaid one penny, then when I could not loan him anymore he began a barage of emailed threats stating, "I will teach you a lesson with a website you will never forget". and, "just Google "Peter Liegl" and then ask yourself how out of your depth you really are _____: If I'm not scared of a billionaire, who are you" etc., etc. The emails contain threats to me and my children promising to build websites for each of us accusing us all three of illegal, illicit and immoral behavior and the threats go on.   Because of all this I believe that Mark Klein must have done somethig nice for Mr Montrief to deserve this Ripoff Report. If you Google Michael Montrief you will find about ten websites all making him out to be some kind of a God or something.  These are websites he created as damage control to repair his reputation in the internet.  His letter to Reputation Management oDesk contains the following sentences, "Unfortunately some evil people have decided to artificially promote links that now appear higher in search results for my name permutations than those results would otherwise return". and..., "Please tell us how quickly you can promote these positive websites listed above to outrank all negative posts".    I hope this clears things up for anyone wishing to do business with Mark Klein.

History[edit]




A Calvin Klein store in Fairview Mall


The early years[edit]
In 1968, Klein founded Calvin Klein Limited, a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000.[5][6] The first Calvin Klein collection was a line of "youthful, understated coats and dresses" featured at the New York City store Bonwit Teller.[5]
In September 1969, Klein appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine.[7]
1970s[edit]
By 1971, Klein had added sportswear, classic blazers, and lingerie to his women's collection.
In 1973, he received his first Coty American Fashion Critics' Award for his 74-piece womenswear collection - the youngest recipient at that time.[7] Klein won the award again in 1974 and 1975.[7] By 1977, annual revenues had increased to $30 million (equivalent to $119 million in 2017), and Klein had licenses for scarves, shoes, belts, furs, sunglasses, and sheets. Klein and Schwartz were making $4 million each. After the company signed licenses for cosmetics, jeans, and menswear, Klein's annual retail volume was estimated[by whom?] at $100 million (equivalent to $395 million in 2017). In 1978, Klein claimed sales of 200,000 pairs of his famous jeans the first week they were on the market. By 1981, Fortune figured Klein's annual income at $8.5 million a year. In the mid-1970s, he had created a designer-jeans craze by putting his name on the back pocket. Klein's design assistant at the time, Jeffrey Banks, has claimed credit for the logo garments, stating that he had the logo from a press folder silkscreened onto the sleeve of a brown T-shirt as a present for Klein.[8] The gift was assumed by Schwartz to be part of the upcoming line, and similar logo shirts formed the uniform for the front-of-house staff at Klein's next catwalk show, leading to buyer demand.[8]
In the late 1970s, the company also made attempts to set up its own fragrance and cosmetics lines, but soon withdrew from the market with big financial losses. In the 1980s, as the designer-jeans frenzy reached its all-time high, Calvin Klein introduced a highly successful line of boxer shorts for women and a men's underwear collection which would later gross $70 million in a single year. Calvin Klein's underwear business promoted later in the 1990s with giant billboards showing images of the pop singer Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, became so successful that his underpants became generally known as "Calvins".
1980s–1985: Underwear[edit]
In the early 1980s, Klein changed the American market of men's underwear—one where most men's underwear was white, purchased in packs of three by a "wife, mother or girlfriend when they needed to be" to one where "the American male [cares] about the brand of something few ever see".[9]
The stunning growth continued through the early eighties. The licensing program, which brought in $24,000 when it was initiated in 1974 (equivalent to $116,551 in 2016), had royalty income of $7.3 million ten years later (equivalent to $16.83 million in 2017). That year, worldwide retail sales were estimated at more than $600 million (equivalent to $1383.15 million in 2017). Klein's clothes were sold through 12,000 stores in the United States and were available in six other countries through licensing deals, namely Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. His annual income passed $12 million (equivalent to $27.66 million in 2017).
Financial problems increased pressure from all sides, disagreements with the licensee of the menswear line and its disappointing sales as well as an enormous employee turnover both within Calvin Klein and its licensing partners led to the first rumors that Calvin Klein Industries, as the company had been known by then, was up for sale. And indeed, in late 1987, it was said that the sale of the company to Triangle Industries, a container manufacturer, had only failed because of the crashing stock market.
Although the company almost faced bankruptcy in 1992, Calvin Klein managed to regain and increase the profitability of his empire throughout the later 1990s, mainly through the success of its highly popular underwear and fragrance lines, as well as the ck sportswear line. During his 1990-1995 stint as Calvin Klein's head of menswear design, John Varvatos pioneered a type of men's underwear called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs.[10] Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg,[10][11] they have been called "one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century."[10] Klein was named "America's Best Designer" for his minimalist all-American designs in 1993, and it came as a surprise in 1999 when it was announced that CKI was again up for sale. Planning to expand its business, the company had been approached by two luxury goods companies, LVMH and Pinault Printemps Redoute, to join Calvin Klein, but nothing resulted. Other potentials like Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Italy's Holding di Partecipazioni proved to be similar disappointments because of CKI's steep price tag of supposedly $1 billion. After seven months and no potential buyer, Klein announced that his empire was not on the market anymore. The company would never manage to go public, which had supposedly been Klein's plan once.

2002–present: Acquisition by Phillips van Heusen[edit]
In mid-December 2002, Calvin Klein Inc. (CKI) was sold to Phillips Van Heusen Corp (PVH),[12] whose then CEO Bruce Klatsky was the driving force behind the deal, for about $400 million in cash, $30 million in stock as well as licensing rights and royalties linked to revenues over the following 15 years that were estimated at $200 to $300 million.[13] The sale also included an ongoing personal financial incentive for Klein based on future sales of the Calvin Klein brand.
PVH outbid VF Corp., the maker of Lee and Wrangler jeans, which had also been interested in the jeans, underwear and swimwear business of CK that had been controlled by Warnaco Group, maker of Speedo swimwear in the US, since 1997. The deal with PVH did not include these businesses, and they remained with Warnaco. Unable to pay debts from acquisitions and licensing agreements and due to bad publicity by a later dismissed lawsuit with Calvin Klein over selling license products to retailers other than agreed upon with Calvin Klein, Warnaco had filed for chapter 11 protection in mid-2001 but eventually emerged from bankruptcy in February 2003.[14]
The transaction between Calvin Klein and PVH was financially supported by Apax Partners Inc., a New York private equity firm, which is said to have made a $250 million equity investment in PVH convertible preferred stock, as well as a $125 million, two-year secured note, all in exchange for seats on the board of PVH.[15]
CKI thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH. In the beginning, Klein himself, who was included as a person in the 15-year contract he had signed with PVH, remained creative head of the collections but then continued as an advisor (consulting creative director) to the new company from 2003 on and has since been more withdrawn from the business. Barry K. Schwartz was said to concentrate on his role as chairman of the New York Racing Association, a horse-racing club. The current President and COO of the CKI division within PVH are Tom Murry, who had filled this position already before the acquisition.
With the fall 2006 Collection runway presentations in New York City, CKI inaugurated an 8,600 sq ft (800 m2) showroom space that can seat up to 600 people on the ground floor of 205 West 39th Street, in Times Square South where Calvin Klein has been headquartered since 1978.
In a 2010 report, PVH, who manages the ready-to-wear activities, had estimated sales of €4.6 billion of Calvin Klein products.[3]
In Feb 2013 Warnaco Group was acquired by PVH which united Calvin Klein formal, underwear, jeans and sportswear lines.[16][17]
Products and marketing[edit]

Fragrances[edit]
Calvin Klein has various lines of perfumes and colognes, including Obsession and Eternity. Until May 2005, their perfumes and the corresponding fragrance lines were maintained by Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company (CKCC), a Unilever company. Cosmetics giant Coty, Inc. of New York bought the fragrance licensing agreements from Unilever.
Advertising[edit]




Calvin Klein models


The early ads were shot by Bruce Weber and Richard Avedon. One of his male underwear models, Mark Wahlberg, went on to fame as hip hop star "Marky Mark", launching himself into the Hollywood scene to become a current actor. Another Hollywood star first appearing in Calvin Klein advertisements is Antonio Sabato Jr.. Calvin Klein employed Kate Moss at the start of her career in the early 1990s and in 2002 after allegations of cocaine use. Other models who have appeared in advertisements early in their careers are Natalia Vodianova, Scott King and Toni Garrn. Currently Calvin Klein uses Tyson Ballou and Lara Stone, and in the past has also used Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Patti Hansen, Tom Hintnaus, David Agbodji, Travis Fimmel, Doutzen Kroes, Mini Anden, Garrett Neff, Sean O'Pry, Edita Vilkeviciute, Jamie Dornan, Liu Wen, Edward Furlong and Vladimir Ivanov.[citation needed] Fit Models include Dale Noelle.[21] Actors such as Eva Mendes, Mehcad Brooks, Scarlett Johansson, Kellan Lutz, Andie MacDowell, Alexander Skarsgard, Zoe Saldana, Rita Ora, Rooney Mara and Diane Kruger have also been chosen to model for the brand.[citation needed] Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg starred in a series of adverts for the company.[22] Recently, singer Justin Bieber appeared in advertising for Calvin Klein's underwear range,[23] as did fashion model Kendall Jenner.
They also have experimented with emerging technologies. When advertising cKone perfume in 1999, they placed e-mail addresses in print advertisements, targeted at teenagers. When these teens mailed these addresses, they would be placed on a mailing list that sent them mails with vague details about the models' lives, with fake details meant to make them more relatable. These mails came at unpredictable intervals and were supposed to give readers the feeling that they had some connection with these characters. Though the mailing lists were discontinued in 2002, the campaign has inspired similar marketing tactics for movies and other retail products.
Branding[edit]
Like other fashion brands, Calvin Klein established a monogram: the "cK" emblem.[24]
Licensees[edit]
As of 2012, the top three licensees were:

Warnco - 40% of license royalties, which is "around $100 million"[3]
Coty - 12% of license royalties[3]
G-III Apparel Group - 14% of license royalties[3]

Internet[edit]
In 2004, the company bought the domain name CK.com. Calvin Klein is one of the few corporations worldwide to own a two letter domain name.[citation needed]
Designers[edit]
When Calvin Klein was acquired by PVH Corp. in 2003, Francisco Costa was appointed the Women’s Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection. The creative director for Calvin Klein Collection for women is Brazilian-born Francisco Costa who had already worked with Klein directly before the founder's departure from the company. Costa had taken over the job in 2003.[25]
Italo Zucchelli, a former Jil Sander and Romeo Gigli designer, had collaborated with Calvin Klein for six seasons before he became head designer Men’s Creative Director of the Calvin Klein Collection menswear line in spring 2004.[26]
Kevin Carrigan, an Englishman, was named the creative director of the ck Calvin Klein, and Calvin Klein (white label), Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear brands and their related licensed products. Carrigan had been with Calvin Klein since 1998.
In April 2016, it was announced that Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli would be leaving the company.[26]
In August 2016, Calvin Klein, Inc. announced the appointment of Raf Simons as Chief Creative Officer of the brand, overseeing all aspects of design, global market and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons assumed the creative strategy of the Calvin Klein brand globally across the company’s ready to wear, bridge, sportswear, jeans, underwear and home lines. Pieter Mulier was also announced as Creative Director, reporting directly to Mr. Simons and responsible for executing his Mr. Simons creative and design vision for men’s and women’s ready to wear, bridge and better apparel and accessories. It was also announced that Kevin Carrigan would leave the company. Simons's first collections debuted for the Fall 2017 season.[27]
In December 2016, it was announced that Amy Mellen would leave the company. In January 2017, it was announced that Clémande Burgevin Blachman would assume the role of Vice President of Design for Calvin Klein Home.

Controversies[edit]
In 1980, Richard Avedon photographed and directed the Calvin Klein Jeans campaign that featured a fifteen-year-old Brooke Shields. Some of those television commercials were banned, including the infamous ad where Brooke asks "Do you want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing!"
The 1995 adverts promoting Calvin Klein jeans received criticism for being "kiddie porn".[28][29][30][31]
In August 2012, Lululemon Athletica filed suit against Calvin Klein and supplier G-III Apparel Group for infringement of three Lululemon design patents for yoga pants.[32] The lawsuit was somewhat unusual as it involved a designer seeking to assert Intellectual Property protection in clothing through patent rights. On November 20, 2012, Lululemon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in the Delaware courts based upon a private settlement agreement reached between the parties that would dismiss the suit.[33] According to a Lululemon press release, "Lululemon values its products and related IP rights and takes the necessary steps to protect its assets when we see attempts to mirror our products.”[34]
However, according to Chevalier's brand book Luxury Brand Management, Klein "is seldom involved in the design and the development of products bearing his name"[3] and "all activities are subcontracted to licensees."[3]
In 2014, Klein was criticized for the designation of Myla Dalbesio in its "Perfectly Fit" advertising campaign as a "plus-size" model, despite not using the term itself.[35]

The Poisoning Of The Calvin Klein Brand
by Mark Ritson

1 Comment




After heady success in the 70s and 80s, the fashion brand fell victim to the dark side of licensing.
It began, as it does with so many brands, with a hefty slice of luck. Thirty nine-years ago, Mildred Custin, a fashion buyer from famed department store Bonwit Teller, got out of a hotel lift on the wrong floor and found herself in a small design studio.
Her confusion quickly changed to astonishment as she surveyed the coats and suits being created by the young designer from the Bronx working there. Before leaving, Custin placed an order for $50,000-worth of merchandise. Calvin Klein was on his way.
The brand’s fame grew quickly among the New York elite. Calvin Klein’s couture line for women established the brand as one of the hottest names in American fashion. By the late 70s, the brand’s prominence had attracted a raft of licensees.
Licensing is an invisible world to most consumers, who believe that if a garment carries Calvin Klein’s name on the label, it must be made by his company. In reality, only a tiny proportion of the products that carried the logo during the 80s and 90s was actually produced by Calvin Klein. Instead, most of the brand’s sales came from licensed arrangements for coats, accessories, watches and jewellery, hosiery, swimwear, and fragrances.
Typically, brands enjoy royalties of between 5% and 20% of the wholesale price of a licensed garment. However, the strength of the Calvin Klein brand combined with its apparent flexibility across a huge array of categories ensured that the company enjoyed some of the best royalty arrangements in the world.
Marketing gurus will trot out examples such as YSL and Gucci and conclude that licensing is brand poison. The reality is not so simple. Calvin Klein proved that licensing can be an effective strategy.
When the organization tried to manufacture its own products, the high costs of production combined with problems of excess inventory almost destroyed it. Most brands are simply not big or diverse enough to produce and merchandise the products that the global market demands. By 1999, 90% of the company’s revenues came from licensees, which produced the brand in more than 40 different categories.
However, there is a dark side to licensing. Klein discovered it the hard way in 2000, when he tried to sell his company for a rumored figure of $1bn. Too much of its success was tied up with other organizations, and a buyer could not be found.
Another major downside of Calvin Klein’s licensing was its increasingly confused brand architecture. A multitude of products at different price points left consumers unsure of the positioning of the brand. This dilution was compounded by licensees dependent on sales from discount retailers, where revenues are brisk but brand equity is bruised. In extreme cases, Calvin Klein’s licensees simply ignored their original agreements with the brand. Klein went so far as to sue one major licensee in 2001 for ‘serious problems as to the quality and the value and the design of the product’.
All this took a toll on the brand, and by 2001 many US department stores had stopped carrying Calvin Klein’s top-end collections. Defying its couture origins, the brand became associated with fragrances and accessible fashion. A recent survey by the Luxury Institute ranked Calvin Klein first for familiarity among rich US women, and last for status. Ouch.
Yet, just when it seemed that Calvin Klein’s best days were behind it, a savior emerged.
Now read this on Calvin Klein’s remarkable turnaround and how it was achieved.
30 SECONDS ON … CALVIN KLEIN
– In the 70s the brand was synonymous with sleek US minimalism and the urban, unisex lifestyle.
– The brand was founded in 1968 by Calvin Klein and friend Benny Schwartz. Klein provided the creative impulse, as a recent graduate of Manhattan’s Fashion Institute of Technology. Schwartz provided the business savvy and $10,000 needed to start their venture.
– A series of racy jeans ads in the 80s featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields provocatively declaring: ‘Nothing comes between me and my Calvins.’
– The sexually charged theme continued in 1993 with a Marky Mark campaign for Calvin Klein’s underwear line. The ads featured a toned Mark Wahlberg in boxers holding his crotch.
– Klein was comfortable with the overt sexuality of his advertising, commenting: ‘Years from now I believe someone may look at all the commercials I’ve done and view them as a vignette of the times, a reflection of what people were thinking.’

Ted 2 Confirms Mark Wahlberg is the King of Product Placement

Move over, Adam Sandler. Mark Wahlberg is now the undisputed king of product placement. Below, how this young man from a humble upbringing has climbed from a petty criminal in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston to Calvin Klein underwear model to the king of the product placement. (Plus, check out all the brands and products spotted in his new film, Ted 2, below.)

For many years, Adam Sandler sat alone in shamelessness atop the product placement throne built of Budweiser cans. In the course of just a couple years, and cementing it this summer movie season, the similarly Budweiser-loving Wahlberg has usurped Sandler’s crown as Hollywood’s product placement king.
Remember 2013’s Pain and Gain? During his promotional blitz for the film, Wahlberg talked about how he muscled up for the film using Marked, a nutritional supplement that he founded.

Then this year, Wahlberg appeared (as himself) in Entourage, a film he also produced based on a series he inspired and executive produced. In his scene, Wahlberg appears wearing a t-shirt with a logo for (wait for it) Marked. To literally cap this self-promo, Wahlberg (as seen above) donned a baseball cap bearing the logo of AquaHydrate, a bottled water brand he co-launched.

Speaking of hats, Wahlberg could be seen in 2014’s Transformers: Age of Extinction wearing a hat with an Indian motorcycles logo. At the time, Wahlberg was in the process of working with Indian as a spokesman and later to develop and launch a “Mark Wahlberg Collection” of Indian motorcycle fashions (“Mark Wahlberg elevates the style of this antique white cotton tee by adding contrast color stitching across the shoulders and the back of the neckband“).

No surprise then to see Wahlberg in his new film, Ted 2, again in a self-referential t-shirt, for Indian.

His next feature should cement his product placement crown. The trailer for his upcoming film, Daddy’s Home, features a very prominent Indian motorcycle product placement.

Below, every product or brand mention seen in Ted 2, which has more than 60 recognizable brands on-screen. 2012’s Ted, in comparison, had 38 products, more than any other #1 film that year.
