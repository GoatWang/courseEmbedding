What is a proxy statement?

The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Rural Residential System
Mr. Ron Hames installed a 10 kW Bergey wind system at his home in 1984 to reduce his utility bills. Mr. Hames brother, Jim, also installed a 10 kW Bergey turbine at his home. The two brothers also installed a third Bergey turbine at their business, R & M Mechanical Contractors. In each case they were able to take advantage of federal and state tax credits (which expired in 1985).
The Hames brothers both live East of Norman in an area of rolling hills. Their business (see the R&M Mechanical Case Study) is ~ 5 miles West in the North part of Norman, where the terrain is more open and less hilly. Even though the wind resource is essentially the same in both areas the two home turbines in the hilly area produce ~ 30% less energy than the business system. It seems that the hilly terrain causes the wind to slow down closer to ground level.
The Hames brothers have had a lot of problems with their inverters, which have had to be repaired a number of times. They both have the older Powersync inverters, which were less robust than the new Gridtek inverter. In the Hames residential systems much of the electronics problems can be traced back to weak rural coop power lines. Their weak power line leads to frequent voltage sags ("brown-outs") and large voltage surges during thunderstorms. In spite of the problems, the systems are still in operation and reducing their utility bills.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for RadNet (NASDAQ:RDNT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $8.00 (3.23% upside)
