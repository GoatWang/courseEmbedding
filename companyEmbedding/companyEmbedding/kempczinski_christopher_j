Chris Kempczinski is going to be the new president of McDonald's USA, a big title and a big job.Kempczinski, who replaces Mike Andres, had been the corporation's executive vice president of strategy, business development and innovation since joining McDonald's last year.Setting aside Andres' performance, Kempczinski's potential, the implications for McDonald's and whatever ambitions hang in the balance, Kempczinski's old job sounds like a very good one to have.Being head of McDonald's USA is about delivering results, all of which are quantifiable and subject to factors that may not be entirely controllable.

A strategy chief pokes and prods and suggests things that could and should go better, and points out potential new business opportunities.When Kempczinski was hired, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook told The Wall Street Journal that the people at the company needed "to challenge ourselves to find other avenues of growth."

Easterbrook said Kempczinski, a former executive vice president of growth initiatives and president of international at the former Kraft Foods Group, was "uniquely placed and skilled to do that and to act as an internal change agent."But now Kempczinski has to manage change and everything else.

Everything else — anything that might affect business — can be a killer.Andres, who shepherded a lot of strategic transformations in his two years overseeing U.S. operations, knows this better than most.No one would ever dispute that it's good to have a plan. But as boxer Mike Tyson famously once said, "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."

Having a job with "strategy" and "innovation" in the title conveys a certain importance and forward-thinking. But the best thing about it is it implies you are more responsible for tomorrow than today.It may well be a gross simplification to say that when you're in charge of strategy and innovation, you look at what works and say let's do more of that.But to quote Kempczinski's bio from his previous McDonald's position: "His role is to serve the business units and franchisees by identifying new ideas and best practices to accelerate their growth and grow the overall value of the system."As for innovation itself, well, everyone wants to be involved in that. More to the point, everyone should be.In innovative companies, practically everyone is.

No one is ever charged with promoting stagnation. No one boasts of being anachronistic, unimaginative, antiquated or tradition-bound on their LinkedIn profile.Media communications specialist Carat UK earlier this year let it be known that it is phasing out the term "innovation" from its job titles. As reported by Campaign, the idea is "to make innovation 'standard practice' across the agency."Which was a bold move by Dan Hagen, who's Carat UK's chief strategy officer.And, really, quite innovative.Whatever the job and whatever it's called, it's easier to plan than take a punch. If Kempczinski doesn't know this, Andres can probably tell him.philrosenthal@chicagotribune.comTwitter @phil_rosenthal
