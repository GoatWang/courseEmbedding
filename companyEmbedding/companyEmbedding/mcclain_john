John McClain's grades for the 2017 NFL draft

1 / 33


Back to Gallery
















NFL teams only will care about how this year's draft class fares in the long run, but before all of these players complete their careers it's fun to praise and scold them for how they did based on their draftees' college careers.
Was Chicago smart to give $15 million to Mike Glennon and then trade multiple picks to move up one spot to get Mitch Trubisky?

John McClain answers all those questions and more in this year's edition of draft grades.

John McClain's Texans' breakdown: Offensive line

1 / 16


Back to Gallery
















Mike Devlin is in his third season as the Texan' offensive line coach, and he used the offseason program to help develop two things he believes are crucial to a team's success: competition and depth.
There are at least 13 linemen who'll be competing at training camp in West Virginia, including returning starters, players acquired during the offseason and others activated from injured lists.



"Ideally, when you're building an offensive line, you always want to keep churning the back end, and that way, it creates depth and competition," Devlin said. "And, hopefully, the cream rises to the top, and you're always getting better.
"Since I've been here, this is the first year (where) we have all this depth and competition and all these little battles that no one's seeing that's going to make us better overall."





Houston Chronicle sports writer John McClain talks about the Houston Texans Offense and what to look for in starters and who will be helming the Offense this season.

                                            Media: Houston Chronicle
                                    

Every starter from last season returns, but there should be changes at some point before regular season begins.
Left tackle Duane Brown, the team's best offensive lineman, missed the offseason program because of an undisclosed contract issue. He could miss training camp, too. When he reports for his 10th season, he'll take he'll secure his position on the left side.
Brown likes to say that what happens on offense begins up front.
Last season, the Texans finished eighth in rushing and 11th in sacks allowed per pass play. But they were 29th in offense, 29th in passing and tied for 28th in points, primarily because of issues at quarterback, where former starter Brock Osweiler struggled all season.
The biggest question entering training camp will be who starts at right tackle?
Derek Newton will miss the season while he continues to recover from surgery to repair ruptured quad tendons in both legs. Chris Clark replaced Newton and struggled in pass protection.

Texans Video Highlights
 



Kendall Lamm, entering his third season, enjoyed a productive offseason and could win the job. He's competing with veteran Breno Giacomini and rookie Julién Davenport.
Brown's absence from the offseason program allowed Lamm and Davenport to get valuable repetitions in practice. If he misses camp, it'll offer more opportunities to the other tackles.
Giacomini is a 10-year veteran who was signed as a free agent. He played for Devlin with the New York Jets and is familiar with the coach's system.
Davenport, a fourth-round pick from Bucknell, picked up the system well in the offseason program. He didn't perform like a lineman who played against small-college competition, but that was without pads.
Left guard Xavier Su'a-Filo and right guard Jeff Allen, starters last season, are back. Su'a-Filo is in the last year of his contract and needs to have his best season.
Allen worked hard in the offseason and lost weight, but he's got to stay healthy and improve in his second season with the Texans.
The competition at center is fierce with Nick Martin and Greg Mancz. Martin, a second-round pick last year, had earned the starting job but suffered a season-ending ankle injury during a practice against New Orleans.
Martin's injury gave Mancz an opportunity, and he took advantage of it. Mancz played every snap but one, including two playoff games, and had a terrific season.
Mancz and Martin are also getting time at guard, a position both played in college. The one who isn't starting will be active on game day and must be prepared to play both positions if called on.
Devlin also welcomes back guard David Quessenberry, who spent the last three years battling cancer. He was cleared in the offseason, and no player was more excited to be on the practice field than he was. In training camp, Quessenberry will be in pads for the first time since his rookie year.
Another player who impressed the coaches in the offseason was guard Chad Slade, who spent last season on the practice squad. The coaches are eager to see if he picks up in camp where he left off in the offseason program.
Among the others competing for places on the team are veteran guard Josh Walker and rookie center Kyle Fuller.
