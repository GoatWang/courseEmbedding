3 Pole / 4 Pole Ground Testers Description
Instrumentation used to measure ground resistance, step and touch potential, multiple ground rod systems and soil resistivity.

3 Pole and 4 Pole Ground Tester Selection Guide
 
Three Pole and Four Pole Grounding instrumentation is chosen based on requirements, applications and safety considerations. Consider the following:


Soil Resistivity- 4 Point Tester

Ground Resistance Rods- 3 Point Tester

Low Ground Resistance Grids or Mats or Plates- 3 or 4 Point Tester

Step and Touch Potential- 4 Point Tester

Continuity on Bonding or Grounding -2 or 4 Point Tester

Earth Coupling- 3 Point Tester

 
The National Electrical Code has established minimum safety values.
The National Electrical Code, Section 250-56 states that the “system impedance to ground (ground rod) is less than 25 ohms and that facilities with sensitive electrical equipment should be 5.0 ohms or less.”
 
A grounding system is designed to provide safety for a variety of conditions that may exist.


Lightening strikes to protect personnel or system components

Electrical faults

Static Electricity Problems

Voltage Regulations for Safety     

A good grounding system will improve the reliability of equipment and reduce the likelihood of damage due to lightning or fault currents. The primary reason that grounding is tested is the fact that resistance to an earth ground rod or system may vary based on changes in climate and temperature and over time. Such changes can be considerable. Over time, corrosion will degrade ground rods and their connections. It is reasonable to consider an annual maintenance program that checks grounds and bonding.

Components of Earth Ground Electrode
 


Resistance of the electrode itself and connections to it, including the clamp and wire connection

Contact resistance between the electrode and the soil adjacent to it

Resistance of the surrounding earth




What affects the ground resistance measured?


The length and depth of the electrode

The diameter of the electrode

The number of electrodes

The total inherent system design

Ground testing systems to be tested also include Multiple Electrodes, Grounding Grids, Grounding Mats and Grounding Plates.
 
Traditional types of methods for ground testing include:


(a) Three Point (Three Pole) “Fall of Potential” for Ground Rods and Grids

(b) Four Point (Four Pole) “Soil Resistivity” Testing

(c) Touch Potential (Three Pole) for Electrical Safety (high ground fault possibility)

(d) Two-Point and Four Point Tests (continuity tests and bonds)

Each method will be discussed briefly

(a)     Three-Point “Fall of Potential”
 
Three Point measurements are used when electrodes or grids can be easily disconnected. Three-point measurement is used to measure resistance to ground of ground rods and grids. The potential difference between rods X and P is measured by a voltmeter, and the current flow between rods X and C is measured by an ammeter. Using Ohm’s Law, R = E/I, we may obtain the ground electrode resistance R. It is not necessary to carry out all the measurements when using a ground tester. The ground tester will measure directly by generating its own current and displaying the resistance of the ground electrode under test (Z).

Earth Coupling. In order to measure Earth coupling, a 3 point system is required. It is primarily used to estimate the influence of two earth resistance systems that are not connected to each other.



 

(b)     Four-Point Soil Resistivity (Wenner Method)
The primary purpose of this test is to locate the areas of lowest soil resistivity which is essential for achieving an economical grounding installation. For most applications, the most accurate method is the 4-Point method. The 4-Point method requires the insertion of four equally spaced electrodes in a test area. A known current from a constant current source is passed between the outermost electrodes and a voltage is then measured across the two innermost electrodes. Most ground resistance instruments will also read the resistance of the rod in test directly in ohms. Soil Resistivity is necessary when determining the design and location of the grounding system especially for new installations to meet acceptable ground resistance requirements.
 
Soil resistivity is a determining factor when measuring the resistance of a grounding site. This determines the electrode resistance and the depth required for acceptable resistance. The resistivity of the soil varies widely throughout the world and changes seasonally. Soil resistivity is determined largely by its content of electrolytes, consisting of moisture, minerals and dissolved salts. A dry soil has high resistivity if it contains no soluble salts.




(c)     Touch Potential / Step Potential
 
Touch potential is the term given to the potential difference a person might experience across their body if they were, for example, standing on the ground outside the perimeter fence of a substation and touching the fence at the time a fault to earth occurred. These tests are recommended when the ground cannot be disconnected, where ground faults are highly likely to occur, or when the “footprint” of grounded equipment (the outline of the part of equipment in contact with earth) is comparable to the size of the ground to be tested. Touch potential is defined as the voltage between an energized object and the feet of a person that may be in contact with that object. In cases close to power distribution sites and fences, the touch potential can be extremely dangerous and hazardous. A four pole tester is used for “touch potential” measurements.
 
Step potential is the potential difference a person would experience between their feet if they walked over the ground in which a fault current existed. A four pole tester is also used for this test.
 
(d) Two-Point and Four Point Tests (continuity tests and bonds)

Even though Micro-Ohmmeters with Kelvin probes are suggested to be used for primary accurate bond testing resistance values, a simpler and less accurate,  quick indication of resistance value may be performed utilizing a 2 pole (2 lead) method measuring DC resistance with less test current.
 
A 2 Point Test may also be used to measure the continuity resistance of any wired system. It also measure the integrity of all single or multiple ground system connections.

Applications
3-Point measurements of resistance to ground of ground rods and grids. 3-Point measurements are used when electrode or grid can be easily disconnected. 
4-Point tests or soil resistivity measurements. Locating areas of lowest soil resistivity is essential for achieving an economical grounding installation. 
Touch and step potential testing measurements. These tests are recommended when the ground cannot be disconnected, where ground faults are highly likely to occur, or when the footprint of grounded equipment (the outline of the part of equipment in contact with earth) is comparable to the size of the ground to be tested. 
2- or 4-Wire tests for continuity tests on bonding or on grounding systems. Test is a DC resistive test using 250mA or more and is used to check bonding of all connection points on the ground system.
Earth coupling measurement and display. Used to estimate the influence of two earth resistance systems that are not connected to each other.6472 DATASHEETProcess Measurement Company offers INSTRUMENT RENTAL, INSTRUMENT REPAIR & CALIBRATION (on site or in our lab).
Process Measurement Company is ISO 17025 Certified.
