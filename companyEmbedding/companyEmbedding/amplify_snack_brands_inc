no need to sign for the box



good to know
how do I order a box?
Ordering is simple. You choose a box type and enter your delivery and payment details. Then all you have to do is sit back and wait to enjoy the food when it arrives, simple as that.
will you deliver to me?
Currently, graze boxes can only be shipped to US addresses, including P.O. Boxes, within the 50 states.
For the time being, graze does not ship to APOs, FPOs, or US Territory addresses.
what food can I get?
We have a range of over ninety tasty snacks (each with a specific benefit to you), including nuts, seeds, juicy dried fruits, tasty crackers, dips and dippers, and natural treats. 
Graze is not suitable for people with allergies. All of our food is packed in the same place, so cross-contamination between any of our ingredients is likely to occur. Our snacks may contain traces of gluten, wheat, eggs, nuts, peanuts, soy, milk and fish. 
how do I choose what goes into my box?
The food in your box is selected based on your own preferences. For each of our foods, you tell us whether you like, love, or would like to try them. We put together your box based on these ratings ensuring you always receive the food you like.
when are my boxes delivered?
When you sign up to graze, you’ll be automatically signed up to receive a box either every week or every two weeks depending on where you are based in the US. Boxes are delivered Monday to Saturday, every day of the year the USPS delivers mail.
how are my boxes delivered?
Graze boxes are delivered by the USPS. Your boxes will arrive with your normal mail and will fit into standard US mailboxes so there’s no need to be home to sign for your box.
will my graze box fit in my mailbox?
We’ve designed our graze boxes to fit inside most standard-sized mailboxes, but we know this can vary. The dimensions of each box are: 6.5" x 9" x 2".
what if I go on vacation?
This can be done on your home page under ‘your regular boxes’. You can postpone your regular boxes one week at a time by clicking on ‘when next?’ and selecting the week you’d like to receive your next box.
If we’ve already started preparing your next box, it won’t be possible for you to push the delivery date back. Amendments to orders can only be made before your cut-off time.
how much does each box cost?
Each 8 snack variety box costs just $13.99 including delivery.  
when do I pay?
You pay per box and we take payment up to a week in advance of you receiving your box as we need time to prepare it and send it to you.
how easy it is to cancel?
There's no commitment ever - you can cancel your deliveries anytime online. However, because we start preparing your boxes in advance, we just need a bit of notice.

 Healthy Snack Recipes
Our busy lives mean that healthy snack ideas are a necessity. If you’re refueling in between meetings or grabbing something for the mid-afternoon slump, we’ve got the healthy snack recipes that will keep your day moving.
Whether you like sweet and nutty or savory and crunchy, these easy snacks can be made in batches ahead of time, stocking your snack drawer for the whole week. Portion them into individual servings for ultimate grab-and-go treat, or keep the whole batch on hand to share with the family.
Our healthy snack recipes are full of wholesome flavor thanks to naturally sweet fruits such as dates, apples and figs; crunchy seeds and nuts; and warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. We even turn to vegetables to get our snacking on thanks to savory, addictive kale chips. You’ll keep the “hangries” away and feel good about the good-for-you choices at hand.
Plus, these healthy snack ideas are great to pack and take along for trips over the river or through the woods, so be sure to pair them with our favorite picnic food ideas and road trip snacks!

Why Amplify Snack Brands Inc. Stock Plunged Today
The better-for-you snack specialist fell short on the bottom line this quarter. Here's why.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Nov 15, 2016 at 12:46PM

What happened
Shares of Amplify Snack Brands Inc. (NYSE:BETR) were down 24.6% as of 12:30 p.m. EST Tuesday after the healthy snack food products company released weaker-than-expected third-quarter 2016 earnings.
So what
Quarterly revenue climbed 48.1% year over year, to $68 million, driven by a combination of growth from Amplify's SkinnyPop brand, additional distribution of its Paqui brand, and its newer Oatmega brand. Amplify's recently closed acquisition of the Tyrrells international brand portfolio contributed $8.6 million in sales during the quarter.
On the bottom line, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that translated to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which adds perspective by excluding things like stock-based compensation and acquisition costs, Amplify Snack Brands' net income was $9.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, flat from last year's third quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $20.1 million.
By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for lower revenue of $65.2 million, but higher adjusted earnings of $0.15 per share.





Now what
Amplify Snack Brands also revised its full-year guidance, and now expects 2016 revenue of $268 million to $272 million (up from its prior range of $260 million to $270 million), and adjusted EBITDA of $84 million to $86 million (down from its prior range of $92 million to $96 million).
During the subsequent conference call, Amplify CFO Brian Goldberg explained that this top-line guidance incorporates a faster-than-expected closing of the Tyrrells acquisition, which added a partial-month period of performance from the new brand, as well as its year-to-date performance and expectations for the remainder of 2016. As for the adjusted EBITDA guidance reduction, Goldberg pointed largely to lower-than-expected volume levels related to missing retailer reset windows for innovation and other products in the second half of this year, which meant deferring new distribution into early 2017. To a lesser extent, unfavorable brand, product, and customer mix negatively affected margins.
To be fair, these items can all be corrected going forward, so Amplify Snack Brands should hardly be considered a broken business as today's drop seems to imply. But given its earnings shortfall and with shares still trading at a lofty 33 times trailing-12-month earnings even after the decline, it's hard to blame investors for taking a step back.

no need to sign for the box



good to know
how do I order a box?
Ordering is simple. You choose a box type and enter your delivery and payment details. Then all you have to do is sit back and wait to enjoy the food when it arrives, simple as that.
will you deliver to me?
Currently, graze boxes can only be shipped to US addresses, including P.O. Boxes, within the 50 states.
For the time being, graze does not ship to APOs, FPOs, or US Territory addresses.
what food can I get?
We have a range of over ninety tasty snacks (each with a specific benefit to you), including nuts, seeds, juicy dried fruits, tasty crackers, dips and dippers, and natural treats. 
Graze is not suitable for people with allergies. All of our food is packed in the same place, so cross-contamination between any of our ingredients is likely to occur. Our snacks may contain traces of gluten, wheat, eggs, nuts, peanuts, soy, milk and fish. 
how do I choose what goes into my box?
The food in your box is selected based on your own preferences. For each of our foods, you tell us whether you like, love, or would like to try them. We put together your box based on these ratings ensuring you always receive the food you like.
when are my boxes delivered?
When you sign up to graze, you’ll be automatically signed up to receive a box either every week or every two weeks depending on where you are based in the US. Boxes are delivered Monday to Saturday, every day of the year the USPS delivers mail.
how are my boxes delivered?
Graze boxes are delivered by the USPS. Your boxes will arrive with your normal mail and will fit into standard US mailboxes so there’s no need to be home to sign for your box.
will my graze box fit in my mailbox?
We’ve designed our graze boxes to fit inside most standard-sized mailboxes, but we know this can vary. The dimensions of each box are: 6.5" x 9" x 2".
what if I go on vacation?
This can be done on your home page under ‘your regular boxes’. You can postpone your regular boxes one week at a time by clicking on ‘when next?’ and selecting the week you’d like to receive your next box.
If we’ve already started preparing your next box, it won’t be possible for you to push the delivery date back. Amendments to orders can only be made before your cut-off time.
how much does each box cost?
Each 8 snack variety box costs just $13.99 including delivery.  
when do I pay?
You pay per box and we take payment up to a week in advance of you receiving your box as we need time to prepare it and send it to you.
how easy it is to cancel?
There's no commitment ever - you can cancel your deliveries anytime online. However, because we start preparing your boxes in advance, we just need a bit of notice.

 Healthy Snack Recipes
Our busy lives mean that healthy snack ideas are a necessity. If you’re refueling in between meetings or grabbing something for the mid-afternoon slump, we’ve got the healthy snack recipes that will keep your day moving.
Whether you like sweet and nutty or savory and crunchy, these easy snacks can be made in batches ahead of time, stocking your snack drawer for the whole week. Portion them into individual servings for ultimate grab-and-go treat, or keep the whole batch on hand to share with the family.
Our healthy snack recipes are full of wholesome flavor thanks to naturally sweet fruits such as dates, apples and figs; crunchy seeds and nuts; and warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. We even turn to vegetables to get our snacking on thanks to savory, addictive kale chips. You’ll keep the “hangries” away and feel good about the good-for-you choices at hand.
Plus, these healthy snack ideas are great to pack and take along for trips over the river or through the woods, so be sure to pair them with our favorite picnic food ideas and road trip snacks!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
