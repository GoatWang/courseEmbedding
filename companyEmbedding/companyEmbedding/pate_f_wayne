Pâté Productions Ltd


















 


















Real Stories about Real People
Our lives. You can't make this stuff up.
Pâté Productions, Ltd. came into existence as the result of a short story written by a 15 year old. A love story about an older couple that explored the choices we make when life cheats us out of time. A story that needed to be shared on film.
We believe that we cannot anticipate what we cannot imagine so our strategy is to ask the audience to enter into the world of  “what if”. We  approach each story looking for what we don’t know, what we can explore together.  As filmmakers we creates stories that resonate with and encourage people to have their own spiritual journey. 
Our projects have a positive world view and explore themes that challenge and entertain us. We are firm believers that within the fabric of these stories lies our collective experience as a culture.    Our aim is to produce thought provoking faith based projects as well as projects that touch the Baby Boomers. We want to challenge our audiences and invite them to look within  as they visit the social and cultural issues embodied in our films. We are storytellers and realize that within the fabric of these stories lie our collective experience as a culture.
Our ultimate goal after creation is to bring these works to theatres where audiences can experience and enjoy the fruits of our collaborative labors.

Canadian Liver Pâté Products Recalled For Inadequate Import Inspection | Food Safety News

Canadian Liver Pâté Products Recalled For Inadequate Import Inspection 
By
News Desk | February 27, 2014


Sun Hing Foods Inc. of South San Francisco, CA, the Importer of Record, is recalling approximately 1,282 pounds of Canadian liver pâté products produced without the benefit of full USDA inspection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced late Wednesday.
While this is a Class I recall, FSIS issues a Public Health Alert for an imported product when the country of origin recalls the product. However, FSIS issues a recall for an imported product when the product is not presented for inspection at the U.S. border. In the United States, the recall is undertaken by the Importer of Record, which is accountable to FSIS.
The following Sun Hing Foods, Inc., products are subject to recall:

2.75-oz. and 4.76-oz. packages of “FLOWER ® BRAND, LIVER PÂTÉ / PÂTÉ DE FOIE” bearing case code “215960.”
4.76-oz. packages of “FORTUNE ® BRAND, LIVER SPREAD / PÂTÉ DE FOIE” bearing case code “215960.”

Packages will bear the Canadian establishment number “265.” The products were distributed into commerce in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.
The problem was discovered when FSIS import staff reviewed records and discovered that the product was not presented by the independent third-party carrier for USDA inspection at the U.S./Canadian border.
FSIS and the company have received no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.
Consumers with questions about the recall should contact Rosenda Chan at (650) 583-8188, ext. 610.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that recalled product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at: at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
