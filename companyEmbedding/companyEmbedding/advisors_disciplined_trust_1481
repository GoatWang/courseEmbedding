Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Factoid of the Day


Tuesday, July 25, 2017






The Weather Company announced yesterday that it expects a total of 15 named storms and eight hurricanes (three will be major in scope) in the Atlantic this hurricane season. The 2017 season began on June 1. Its forecast matches the average amount of activity posted from 1995 through 2016 (15 named storms and eight hurricanes/three major in scope). Since 1980, there have been 32 hurricanes in the U.S. that produced damages in excess of $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and Bloomberg. The combined losses, adjusted for inflation, totaled $549.9 billion, with Katrina (2005) accounting for $156.3 billion of it.

                  Professional Profile
                
 Overview: James has a Merrill Lynch Wealth Management team that serves affluent individuals and families, professional athletes and entertainers, business owners and non-profit organizations.  James helps his clients find innovative ways to connect all the pieces of their financial lives to help them pursue their goals.  Further, he focuses on preserving his clients assets through conservative investments, insurance and estate planning services.  James does so, in part, by connecting his clients with all the intellectual capital that exists at Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and US Trust.In addition to his work at Merrill Lynch, James is an advocate for finding a cure for cancer and serves as a board member on the American Cancer Society’s Volunteer Leadership Board of Broward.  Structured Process:  James, and his team, applies a structured and disciplined Goals-Based Wealth Management approach to each of their clients. Assess the Situation  – We get to know our clients from a demographic, financial and behavioral perspective. Articulate Needs and Goals  – Once we have gotten to know our clients, we help them identify concerns and define goals. Define and Refine Approach  – Once we have identified concerns and goals with our clients, we assess their ability to fund those goals.  We run "what-if" scenarios and, if necessary, we help clients refine goals. Implementation  – After we have helped our clients identify their goals, we work with them to implement goals-based investments. Review Progress  – Once we have implemented goals-based investments for our clients, we have discussions and conduct reviews to help them stay on target.  And we make course corrections and rebalance portfolios, as needed.
 James Jackson  Financial Advisor James has over ten years of investment, alternative assets and advisory experience covering multiple asset classes including public equity, private equity, real estate, fixed income, commodities and currencies.
