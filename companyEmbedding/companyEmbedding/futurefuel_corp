Company









 


FutureFuel Corp
FutureFuel Corp. was created in 2005 as a special purpose acquisition vehicle to acquire companies that we believe can make a notable impact in the biofuel and fuel industries. In the summer of 2006, we found just that in FutureFuel Chemical Company (formerly named “Eastman SE, Inc.”) near Batesville, Arkansas. On October 31, 2006 we completed the acquisition and since then have worked to become a leader in the U.S. biofuel industry, while maintaining the facility’s status as a world-class specialty chemical manufacturer.








 




 


Manufacturing Facility History
FutureFuel’s manufacturing facility, with over 400 employees, has a 30 year history of specialty and custom chemical development and production, first as a member of the Chemicals Division of Eastman Kodak Company from 1976—1993, and then as a member of Eastman Chemical Company from 1994—2006.
Manufacturing Capabilities
FutureFuel has the people, facilities, and technology to offer a variety of specialty chemical products, including fine and performance chemicals in quantities ranging from a few hundred pounds to many millions of pounds. Toll conversions and custom syntheses are also available for meeting specific customer needs.
Modern, general-purpose batch processing equipment features state-of-the-art computer-controlled technology. Dedicated continuous processing facilities can be provided to meet customer production requirements.


 




 








Committed to a sustainable and healthy today and tomorrow.
FutureFuel maintains the highest standards of safety for both our employees and our environment. We take responsibility to our community seriously and believe it important to do our part for its well- being. With this view, we have applied our experience and know-how as a world-class supplier of custom and specialty organic chemicals to becoming a leading U.S. manufacturer of premium biodiesel and other biofuels.


 




 


Health, Safety, Environment, and Security
FutureFuel is committed to the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care® initiative. Responsible Care® is the chemical industry’s world-class performance initiative which is committed to the safe, responsible and sustainablemanagement of chemicals through their entire life cycle, and for their intended end use.

Cold Weather Tips




Biodiesel Cold Weather Storage and Use Recommendations
Quality:


Purchase only ASTM D6751 certified biodiesel, preferably from a BQ-9000 accredited producer or certified marketer, and request a certificate of analysis from your supplier.


Ensure the quality of your diesel fuel as well. Off-quality diesel, or diesel with water, can cause problems when blended with good quality biodiesel, especially in cold weather.


Biodiesel Storage:


For best results, store biodiesel in aluminum, stainless steel, or carbon steel tanks.


Clean storage tanks before using biodiesel. Biodiesel is an excellent solvent and will break loose deposits left from petroleum diesel use. These deposits will end up in fuel filters and cause operational problems.


Inspect storage tanks for water accumulation regularly, and if water is present, remove immediately. Routine tank maintenance can eliminate fuel related problems.


Winterization:


Winterize fuel, storage tanks and fuel handling equipment.


B2 thru B20 blends can be winterized by treating the diesel fuel with distillate or a commercial additive.


Storage tanks should be heated or insulated to maintain biodiesel temperatures above the cloud & pour points. Piping, pumps, and valves also should be insulated or heated for similar reasons.


Know the cloud point of the biodiesel you are using. Biodiesel cloud points vary by feed stock—soybean oil provides cloud points in the low 30° F range while animal fats provide cloud points in the mid 40 to mid 50° F range. Biodiesel made from combinations of feed stocks will have cloud points that vary depending on the ratio of feed stocks used.


Transportation and Blending:


Avoid back-loading B100 or blended fuel into a tanker contaminated with vegetable oils, animal fats, non-diesel fuels, lubricants, or chemicals.


Unload B100 trucks promptly after arrival in cold weather. Do not let them sit out overnight unless the truck is insulated or equipped with an external heating source.


Injection blending provides a more uniform and reliable blend than splash blending.


If splash blending is used, it is recommended to splash biodiesel into diesel when blending from the top of tanks. When blending from the bottom of tanks, it is recommended to blend diesel into biodiesel.


For best blending results, ensure the biodiesel temperature is 60° F or higher. This will also ensure flow ability of your fuel.


Where To Get Help:


Contact your local biodiesel supplier or FutureFuel Chemical Company if you have questions concerning the storage, handling, or use of biodiesel during cold weather.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
