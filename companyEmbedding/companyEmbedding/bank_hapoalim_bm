				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7.

Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10.

History[edit]




Bank Hapoalim, Haifa


The bank was established in 1921 by the Histadrut, the Israeli trade union congress (lit. "General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel") and the Zionist Organisation.
The bank was owned by the Histadrut until 1983, when it was nationalized following the Bank Stock Crisis. The bank was held by the Israeli government until 1996 when it was sold to a group of investors led by Ted Arison.




Shari Arison, owner of Arison Holdings, which controls Bank Hapoalim


As of the end of 2015 the bank has 11,930 employees worldwide. It is controlled by Arison Holdings, which is owned by Shari Arison. Arison Holdings owns a total of 20 per cent of the bank.
In January 2014, PGGM (the second largest Dutch pension fund) and Danske Bank decided to no longer invest in Bank Hapoalim due to its involvement in the financing of settlements in the Palestinian territories, because they considered it illegal under international law.[1] Following discussions between Danske Bank and Bank Hapoalim, Danske Bank reversed its decision and removed Bank Hapoalim from its exclusion list in November 2015.
Global presence[edit]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
