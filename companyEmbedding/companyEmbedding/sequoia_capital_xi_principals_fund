Ethos






Sequoia, 1972 and beyond
The creative spirits. The underdogs. The resolute. The determined. The outsiders. The defiant. The independent thinkers. The fighters and the true believers. 
These are the founders with whom we partner. They’re extremely rare. And we’re ecstatic when we find them.
We partner early—sometimes when a company is no more than an idea. We know these crucial first decisions can have an exponential influence on the curve of success. 
Our style is not for everyone. We push when we see potential. We are direct. Some don’t like our approach. Most who know us do.
Our team mirrors the founders with whom we partner: hungry overachievers with a deep-rooted need to win. Many come from humble backgrounds. Many are immigrants. Many formed or built companies of their own before joining Sequoia. Each shares the mindset of an entrepreneur, and knows what it means to walk that path.
We value teamwork over showmanship. Our contribution to a company always comes from several of us working together. We’re skittish about the first person singular, and don’t care to see our names in the press. 
Our team is small. We prefer a few people with diverse strengths focused on a small number of companies, and we are always mindful of lessons learned -- some painfully -- that are eternal truths. Our network is strong.  Our advantage comes from four decades of legendary founders helping each other.
Long ago we made nonprofits the backbone of our limited partner base. Working for these charities brings intense meaning to what we do. It gives us a heightened sense of responsibility.
We’re serious about our work, and carefully choose the words to describe it. Terms like “deal” or “exit” are forbidden. And while we’re sometimes called investors, that is not our frame of mind. We consider ourselves partners for the long term. 
We help the daring build legendary companies.

History[edit]
Sequoia was founded by Don Valentine in 1972[7] in Menlo Park, California. In the mid-1990s, Valentine gave control of the company to Doug Leone and Michael Moritz.[3] In 1999, Sequoia expanded its operations to Israel.[8] Sequoia Capital China was established in 2005 as an affiliate to the U.S. firm.[9] In 2006, Sequoia Capital acquired Westbridge Capital Partners, an Indian venture capital firm. It later was renamed Sequoia Capital India.[10] CB Insights recognized Sequoia Capital as the number one venture capital firm in 2013.[11] The U.S. firm had 11 partners as of 2016.[12]
In 2015, Sequoia drew criticism[13][14] after Moritz responded to questions about why the U.S. firm had never had a female investing partner by saying Sequoia was looking for women to hire, but "[w]hat we’re not prepared to do is to lower our standards."[15] Members of the media, technology and investment communities criticized the statements as suggesting "smart, driven, capable young women interested in working in technology...don’t exist."[16] Moritz subsequently issued a statement saying, "I know there are many remarkable women who would flourish in the venture business" and said the firm was working to find them.[17] In 2016, Sequoia hired Polyvore CEO Jess Lee, 33, as an investing partner, making her Sequoia's first female investing partner[18] as well as one of its youngest partners.[12]
Investments[edit]

History[edit]
Sequoia was founded by Don Valentine in 1972[7] in Menlo Park, California. In the mid-1990s, Valentine gave control of the company to Doug Leone and Michael Moritz.[3] In 1999, Sequoia expanded its operations to Israel.[8] Sequoia Capital China was established in 2005 as an affiliate to the U.S. firm.[9] In 2006, Sequoia Capital acquired Westbridge Capital Partners, an Indian venture capital firm. It later was renamed Sequoia Capital India.[10] CB Insights recognized Sequoia Capital as the number one venture capital firm in 2013.[11] The U.S. firm had 11 partners as of 2016.[12]
In 2015, Sequoia drew criticism[13][14] after Moritz responded to questions about why the U.S. firm had never had a female investing partner by saying Sequoia was looking for women to hire, but "[w]hat we’re not prepared to do is to lower our standards."[15] Members of the media, technology and investment communities criticized the statements as suggesting "smart, driven, capable young women interested in working in technology...don’t exist."[16] Moritz subsequently issued a statement saying, "I know there are many remarkable women who would flourish in the venture business" and said the firm was working to find them.[17] In 2016, Sequoia hired Polyvore CEO Jess Lee, 33, as an investing partner, making her Sequoia's first female investing partner[18] as well as one of its youngest partners.[12]
Investments[edit]
The firm invests in both public and private companies. It specializes in incubation, seed stage, startup stage, early stage, and growth stage investments in private companies.[19] The company invests mainly in companies based in the United States for early and seed stage investments. It invests between $100,000 and $1 million in "seed" stage, between $1 million and $10 million in early stage, and between $10 million and $100 million in companies that are in their growth stage.[20]
Sequoia Capital has invested in over 250 companies since 1972, including Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, Stripe, YouTube, Instagram, Yahoo! and WhatsApp.[21] The combined current public market value for these companies is over $1.4 trillion, equivalent to 22 percent of Nasdaq.[3] Its portfolio is mainly in financial services, healthcare, outsourcing and technology.[19] As in 2017, they have exited in 68 IPOs and 203 acquisitions.[22]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
